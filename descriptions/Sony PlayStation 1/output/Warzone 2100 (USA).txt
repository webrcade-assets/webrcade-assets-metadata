Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game where you must plan, design and implement a number of factors in order to complete missions. You must begin by setting up a base camp and clearing away any scavenger groups within the vicinity. You start with a small force of troops that must be commanded to fight attacking forces and build the base camp. Oil derricks must be constructed in order to extract oil, which is your main source of energy. Power generators must also be built to convert the oil into power. This power is used to run the rest of your base camp, which can consist of command centers, research facilities, factories and other military structures.

After your base camp is established you must send troops out into the wasteland to recover artifacts, discover more oil pools and raid enemy strongholds. It is vitally important to recover artifacts because these are the source of new technologies. Artifacts must be studied at your research facility before the new technology can be implemented. The new technology can be used to design and manufacture new weapons and vehicles. There are over 2,000 units that can be designed in Warzone 2100. All missions are timed, so you must think and act quickly or you could risk losing the new technology to those who wish to use it for evil means.
