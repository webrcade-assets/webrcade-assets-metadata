Players can choose to play as one of fourteen professional golfers such as Fuzzy Zoeller and Jim Gallagher Jr. or choose to create their own golfer by giving them a name and choosing what their golfer looks like from the few portraits that are available.

Players are then able to select what type of game mode they want to play. Game modes include letting the player practice a round of golf, compete in a tournament, have a shoot-out, or compete in a Skins game.
