Dead in the Water is all about the thrills, chills, and spills of powerboat racing. Choose from 14 different boats, and then hit one of the nine courses, each with unique obstacles, conditions, and jumps. After winning a race, upgrade your weapons to keep a tactical advantage over the competition. If racing for speed is not your style, play the battle mode and try to destroy all of your opponents. Thanks to the realistic water physics, swells will throw your boat into the air, currents will affect your speed based on their direction, and landing hard after a jump will put the boat under water and cause a major slowdown. Can you handle all of the action of Dead in the Water?
