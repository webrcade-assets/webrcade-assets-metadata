Burning Road is an arcade racing game, heavily influenced by Daytona USA. There are four types of cars to drive: two muscle cars, a drag car and a monster truck, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are three different courses to drive on (a wooded area, city streets and snow area) and also have a reverse track variation that can be unlocked. The object is not only to finish ahead of opponents, but also cross checkpoints in order to add more time to the ever depleting timer at the top of the screen.
