Players do combat over a number of stages located all over the western United States, whether in Story or Arcade Mode. Each stage has interactive features, such as ballistic missiles and launching Aurora planes for the Area 51 level. Every vehicle is equipped with a machine gun by default, but up to three out of five available weapons - mines, autocannons, rocket pods, mortars, and homing missiles, plus a special weapon unique to the vehicle - can be installed. Two types of special attacks can be made using each of the five standard weapons, at a bigger cost in ammunition, by performing fighting game-style movements and button presses on the control pad. These attacks can be performed to eliminate nearly-destroyed cars in a method called "Totaling." The player can also score up to six combo hits called Whammies. Special icons can also be picked up such as wrenches to repair damage and yellow zigzag lines to temporarily jam the opponent's homing-based weapons. Certain objectives in Story Mode must be completed to help unlock the game's secret characters and stages. The game also offers players the option to play standard music CDs during a match.
