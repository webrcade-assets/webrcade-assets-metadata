ADIDAS POWER SOCCER ’98 brings the action of soccer to the PlayStation. Thanks to the dynamic camera technology, you’ll get the best view of the action and the camera won’t miss a single flick pass, slide-tackle, or short dribble. All of this combines to make the game feel like a live broadcast.

If realism is not what you are looking for, or if the refs keep rewarding your play with red cards, then switch from the Simulation mode to Arcade mode. With fewer rules and faster play, Arcade mode creates a wide-open game with lots of scoring. ADIDAS POWER SOCCER ’98 provides enough action to keep both fans and casual observers of soccer engrossed in the world’s most popular sport.
