Ah, the smell of fresh cut grass and pine tar. It is spring, and that means that it is time for baseball. Thanks to HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000, you can play baseball anytime. Choose from all 30 Major League teams (all with their actual rosters) and hit the field. You can jump into the action with two randomly selected teams in a Quick Game, or if you prefer to pick your team and the opposition, play the Exhibition mode. Season mode will allow you experience the ups and downs of the Major Leagues, or cut to the chase and try to win the World Series in the Playoff mode. If you don't have enough time for a full game, take the Home Run Challenge and try to knock the cover off of the ball. HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2000 will give you all of the action of professional baseball, even in the middle of winter.
