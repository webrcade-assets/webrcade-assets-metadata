The game requires the player to navigate labyrinthine mines while fighting virus-infected robots. The player is given the clear objective to find and destroy each mine's reactor core and escape before the mine is destroyed by the meltdown. To obtain access to the reactor, the player must collect the blue, yellow, and red access keys for each location. As an optional objective, the player can also choose to rescue PTMC workers that were taken hostage by the infected robots.
