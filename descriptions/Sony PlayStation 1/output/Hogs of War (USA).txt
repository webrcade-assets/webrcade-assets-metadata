Six nations fight for control of Saustralasia in Hogs of War. You side with one of the nations and fight through 25 levels of turn-based action. However, your army is rather unique: it is comprised of pigs. Yes, the smartest of all barnyard animals have decided to wage a war for resources. On each turn, you control one pig for a set amount of time. You can move the animal and attack the enemy, and when time is up you switch to another soldier in the three- to five-member team. After all of your swine have moved, the enemies take their turn in a similar manner. For a real combat challenge, hook up the multi-tap and battle up to three friends in the multiplayer mode. Will you be able to handle all of the combat and take control of Saustralasia? The only way to find out is to play HOGS OF WAR.
