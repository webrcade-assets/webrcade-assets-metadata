Three great games in one! Standard game: The classic game is played under the same rules as its real life counterpart. Quest game: Different 3-pin combinations are set up on the lane. Completing a 3-pin set up moves you onto the next 3-pin set up and provides you with an extra chance! Special game: 45 pins are set up on the lane. The player is given three chances (balls) per frame to knock down all the pins. Each game is seven frames long. This is the real BOWLING!!
