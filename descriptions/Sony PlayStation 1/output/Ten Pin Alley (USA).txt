Tired of wasting your hard-earned money at the local bowling alley? Are the rented bowling shoes a bit on the raunchy side? Would you rather conserve gas and stay home? If so, grab a copy of Ten Pin Alley and hit the virtual lanes in the comfort of your very own living room! You'll have a choice of three environments: the modern Ten Pin Alley, an old-styled Maui Bowl and the nighttime light show found within the Conga Bowl.

Developed by Adrenaline Entertainment, Ten Pin Alley features twelve different characters (both male and female) with varying styles and playing characteristics. While some bowl left-handed and concentrate on accuracy, others specialize in speed and power. When it's your turn to hurl the ball down the lane, a bowling meter appears -- this meter regulates spinning, power and releasing techniques. Although putting spin on the ball is optional, you'll need to adjust your character's positioning in accordance. Failure to do so may result in an embarrassing gutter ball.
