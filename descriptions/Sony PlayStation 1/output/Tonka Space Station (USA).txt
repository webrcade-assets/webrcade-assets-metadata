Tonka Space Station features nine different arcade-style games, each covering a different part of life on a space station, from gathering food to fighting off rogue asteroids. Each challenge also features a different Tonka vehicle to help you complete your task, such as driving the TEV (the Tonkonium Extraction Vehicle) with the front mounted drill or speeding through space in a space ship.

The game not only provides arcade action but also teaches the responsibilities associated with running a space station. You start off with a small group of people, and with careful management you can watch your population grow. You can monitor their happiness levels, as well as how productive they are. Remember, these people are counting on you.

So team up with Tonka Joe and see if you have what it takes to build a successful space station. Are you the person for the job?
