Reel Fishing is designed to create a realistic angling experience in the comfort of the gamer's living room. Strategy comes in choosing the right lure for the circumstance and it takes skill to hook the big ones and reel them in successfully. Underwater shots and "fish-eye" views of the lure offer a perspective on the sport that few ever see on an actual outing. Players can even take a "picture" of their prize catch before releasing it back into the virtual wild.

Features:
* Catch a variety of fish that inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams
* Keep your catches in your virtual fish tank
* Unlock new and more challenging fishing spots as the game progresses
