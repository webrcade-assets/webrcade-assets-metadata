ANDRETTI RACING brings the excitement of racing to the PlayStation. Unlike most other racing games, ANDRETTI RACING includes both stock car and Formula 1 racing. Take a customized stock car out on one of the 16 real-world tracks like Calder Park Thunderdome, Oceanside International Raceway, or Vallejo Speedway. Should slamming the walls of the track become a regular occurrence, the car will start to show the wear and tear of the race: spoilers will break off, headlights will shatter, or wheels will go flying with really big crashes. To keep that from happening, join the racing school and get video tips from the Andretti family. After learning how to keep your car in mint condition, challenge a friend with the Two-Player mode or compete in the Season mode and claim the championship. Every fan of racing will find something to love in ANDRETTI RACING.
