Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 sets out to bring the look and feel of Supercross and Motorcross racing to your PlayStation. To ensure this, McGrath worked with the designers in creating and designing the various tracks and bikes contained within the game.

Featuring fully 3D rendered graphics, the game has over seven different indoor and outdoor tracks to compete on. Competition comes in the way of a Championship Series, Time Trial, Split-Screen or Single Race. The Championship Series consists of season competition in your attempt to become number one. If you manage to accomplish this, you will then have to race McGrath himself to claim your prize. The Time Trial is simply a race against a "ghost" image of best performance, and the Single Race allows you to learn the course designs and practice controls.
