For years the Demon Tower has beckoned to you and, today, on your fifteenth birthday, you have come of age. Do you follow in your father's footsteps and enter the Tower or live a peaceful life in the town of Monsbaiya - it's time to choose.

Take the role of an apprentice monster tamer.
Search the magical tower for demon eggs to collect and grow.
Tame the monsters you raise and sell them for profit or use them in your search for even more powerful demons.
Spend you profits to build up the town of Monsbaiya - attracting new settlers and maybe a love interest or two.
Search for the true ending - does it lie in the summit of the Tower or in a prosperous, well-planned town?
