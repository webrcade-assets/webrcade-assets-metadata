Superior enemy intelligence.

We've devised a weapon that's deadlier than a smart bomb. It's called a smart pilot. Now, Ace Combat 2 pits you against a whole squadron of them - 3-D polygon jet jocks that maneuver like the real deal; turning every scorching sortie and dogfight into a kill-or-be-killed situation. With nearly double the missions of its predecessor, you'll double your chances of taking out the enemy. (Or taking a heat-seeker up the exhaust.)

The most realistic dogfights ever created for the PlayStation game console.

-Total 3-D polygon environment - fly freely and unload your arsenal with reckless abandon.
-Advanced artificial intelligence - cunning and calculating enemy pilots.
-30 formidable missions - nearly double the missions of Air Combat.
-Awesome mission debriefings - dynamic diagrams and moving maps for surgical strikes.
-Secret planes and hidden missions - the better you fly, the more you'll reveal.
