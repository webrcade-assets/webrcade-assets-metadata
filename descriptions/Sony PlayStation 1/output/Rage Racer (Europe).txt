Rage Racer is an arcade-style racing game developed exclusively for the PlayStation by Namco, creators of the Ridge Racer and Pole Position series. The game features four distinct courses, each winding through a multitude of ancient landmarks, natural wonders, lighthouses, tunnels, and villages. The "Grand Prix" mode offers players the chance to make their way through five different racing classes, earning medals and credits along the way. Credits can be used to purchase new tires, paint jobs, and logos, or players can use the credits to purchase newer, more powerful cars. As gamers progress through Rage Racer they will gradually unlock the ability to race each course backward, effectively doubling the number of tracks.
