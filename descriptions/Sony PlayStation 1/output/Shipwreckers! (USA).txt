As an upstart pirate captain in Shipwreckers!, you embark on a journey across the seven seas, doing what comes naturally; namely, finding treasure, pillaging, and attacking any luckless ships that wander into your path. Viewed from a top-down overhead perspective, Shipwreckers! is an offbeat, comical adventure. As you navigate the myriad of puzzles, traps and challenges found in the game, keep a sharp eye out for map bottles floating throughout each of the five exotic locales, which allow you to exit each world. At your disposal is an arsenal of weird and wonderful weapons, ranging from traditional cannonballs to magical bolts of lightning.
