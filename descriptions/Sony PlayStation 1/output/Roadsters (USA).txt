Titus returns to the racing games that they started in Commodore Amiga with the Crazy Cars game series (the first one was released in 1987 and the third and last one in 1992) with Roadsters that features the same great gameplay with enhanced 3d graphics.

Ever feel like betting on yourself in a high-speed race? Well Roadsters gives you that opportunity. In a racing game featuring ten tracks with thirty different cars, Titus has made a game where being the best driver does not necessarily ensure success. You also need the cash flow!
