NFL GAMEDAY '98 is loaded with features like Preseason, Season, and Training Camp modes. You can also choose to play as a skill player, like wide receiver or fullback. And when you consider that you also get a play editor, a create-a-player feature, over 100 touchdown dances, and accurate player attributes, you'll realize why the GAMEDAY series is one of the best around. You can also take on your friends (up to eight with the multitap) in the Versus mode.
