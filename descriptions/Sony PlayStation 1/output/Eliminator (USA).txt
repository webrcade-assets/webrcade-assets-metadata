Take the wheel of a hovercraft and try to survive the ELIMINATOR. Tackle the challenges of the Penitentiary, Maze, Asylum, Cage, Chasm, Monastery, Tomb, and Fortress, but pay attention to the clock, because if it runs out, so does your life. Blast enemies on the ground or in the air thanks to a revolutionary new targeting system. Should the arena challenges become too easy, challenge your friends with the Versus mode. Do you have the guts to face the ELIMINATOR?
