Ballblazer is a futuristic version of one-on-one indoor soccer, but with the use of a variety of weapons. Much like soccer, your goal is to put the ball in the net more times than your opponent does. Each player rides around in a rotofoil, used to speed around the arena field. However, in order to win the match, you must win three, four-minute rounds.
