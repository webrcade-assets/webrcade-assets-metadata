A budget release from Agetec, this puzzler (also known to some as Tic Tac Chicken) challenges gamers to create a safe path for a lost baby chick so he can return home. Slide and spin the tile pieces to form his walkway, but you're going to have to think quick -- the tiles are floating on water and the little guy isn't a good swimmer!
