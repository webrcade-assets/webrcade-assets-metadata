Racing tracks in the game include Dark Forest Dash, Magma Moon Marathon, Tribal Island Trail and the Desert Adventure Dragway.  Track hazards and tight corners present other obstacles that players need to master.  Each track has its own set of unique hazards that need to be overcome in order to be a winner.  For example, there are Lego barrels that can be shot away to reveal a short cut or lava geysers to avoid in Magma Moon Marathon.
