Are you ready to go racing with your favorite aardvark? Children will love the thrills of building and racing their very own cars in ARTHUR! READY TO RACE. Start from the ground up by creating the fastest car possible. Then, try to accumulate coins and Bionic Bunny cards by going fast and solving difficult problems that are presented. Choose whether you want to start slow with Practice mode, at a moderate clip with Qualifying, or at an expert level with Championship Derby.

There are three different race tracks to help keep the scenery exciting, and four race-based activities to enjoy: Baby Kate Library Chase, Muffy’s Garden Challenge, Cemetery Search, and Pal’s Chase. In addition to the racing, kids will be able to chat with friends in Arthur’s neighborhood, listen to music, or help local businesses with chores. There are plenty of rewards (both in-game and educational) to be collected, and you just couldn’t ask for a friendlier group of characters.

In this game, Arthur and his friends want to build the best racer they can. The gameplay is quite simple and easy to learn for young children. Throughout the game, you play as Arthur and get to drive in your racer, solve problems, collect coins, and accumulate Bionic Bunny cards that you can trade for great new accessories for your racer.
