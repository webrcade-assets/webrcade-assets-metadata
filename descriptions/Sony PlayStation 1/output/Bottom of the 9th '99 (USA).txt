Konami's Bottom of the 9th is the first baseball game on the PlayStation to use polygonal players. Batting and pitching relies on aiming cursors, which can be "locked-on" to make things easier for novices. The game has an MLBPA license for real players from the 1995 season, but no Major League Baseball affiliation, so teams are listed by city name only.

Eight fictional stadiums are also available, and a complete season along with statistical tracking can be saved to memory card. Don't want to play a complete season? No problem, the schedule can be shortened to 13, 26 or 52 games. Training Camp mode allows you work on your pitching, hitting, fielding or running skills, and a General Manager mode lets you perform trades. An announcer will keep things lively by calling the action from the booth.
