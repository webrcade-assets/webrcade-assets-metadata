Surfing makes an appearance on the PlayStation with CHAMPIONSHIP SURFER. Choose a board and hit the wave in six different game modes. Championship mode is a tournament, complete with time limits and panel scoring just like real surf competitions. Arcade mode has a point-based system; score enough points and avoid the obstacles to advance to the next round. Play a game of Simon Says in the Trick Attack mode, or just surf for a specific amount of time in the Time Attack mode. If you simply want a casual day at the beach, use the Free Surf mode and don't worry about scores or time limits. For the ultimate challenge, you and your friends should play the Rumble mode where points are scored by knocking your opponent off the wave. Get ready to hang ten any way you want with CHAMPIONSHIP SURFER.
