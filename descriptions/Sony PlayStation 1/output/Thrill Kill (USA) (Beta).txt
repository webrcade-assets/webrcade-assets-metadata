Hell Hath No Fury Like... THRILL KILL

Eight fighters, eight souls. Each has died and descended into Hell, except it's not the classical Dante's Hell. It's a modern day Hell based on the real world of today's deviants. The characters are the physical manifestations of their mental illnesses or vices on earth. Marukka, the God of Secrets, is bored and decided that it would be fun to pit them all against each other with the prize being rebirth. Each character is battling for nothing more than self-preservation and the hope to be born again.
