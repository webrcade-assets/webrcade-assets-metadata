You're a World Class Tank Racer racing in a race for the World Tank Racing Championships (WTRC). It's a vicious racing circuit as you'll find yourself racing against seven other highly motivated racers. To add to your racing woes, you'll also have to start each race at the end of the pack. As if there wasn't already enough racing in this paragraph, you'll need to place fairly high in each of the sixteen races just to get a shot at the WTRC Cup.
