In the 22nd Century, every day is judgment day. Criminals thrive in vast, domed megacities-facing no police force or court of law... just the lone justice of street-prowling judges.

Leading an army of merciless androids, he's determined to go holster-to-holster against only you... the last word is justice... Judge Dredd.
