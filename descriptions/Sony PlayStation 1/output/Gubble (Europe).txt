Gubble is a cute, colorful alien and he needs your help to get back to his home in this PlayStation game. It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners. So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful.

Success will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech equipment remain in one piece.
