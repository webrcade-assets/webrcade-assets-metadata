Baseball makes another appearance on the PlayStation with GRAND SLAM. Use the Practice mode to brush up on your baseball skills, and then hit the field for a friendly game in the Exhibition mode, or experience the unique challenges of a Season or Tournament. If you don't have time for a full game, you can use the Home Run Derby to get in some quick action. No matter what mode you play, all of your favorite baseball players are here thanks to an MLBPA license. An innovative power meter-based batting and pitching system puts you right in the middle of the action. Since the animation is motion captured, the players have smooth, fluid movements. GRAND SLAM has all of the modes and action baseball fans love, only with this game you don't have fight traffic to get out of the stadium parking lot.
