The year is 2060 A.D. and the Red Menace has resurfaced and declared war on the entire world. The seas and skies are filled to the brim with enemy submarines, hostile aircraft, powerful battle cruisers, blood, oil, and wreckage. You command TigerShark, a fully-loaded subfoil prototype, capable of massive destruction. Your ship is constantly barraged with enemy firepower as you lay waste to (almost) anything that moves. From time to time ally submarines appear on screen and you must lead them to safety miles below the surface. TigerShark features two simultaneous 3D worlds (above and below the water), multiple viewpoints, and a drop-cam.
