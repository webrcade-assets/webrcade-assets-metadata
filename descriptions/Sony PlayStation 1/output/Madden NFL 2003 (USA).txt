Electronic Arts' American football series continues on Sony's 32-bit console. 2003's PlayStation installment in the successful Madden NFL Football series once again offers expansive feature sets and detail, but adds more depth and polish, faster gameplay, upgraded graphics and animations, realistic player AI, and in-depth play modes. Madden football fans can play head-to-head against friends and engage in a new training mode that helps them develop critical football related skills. As usual, EA included plenty of hidden extra, such as secret teams to unlock and extra cheat tips that keep the gaming experience varied.
