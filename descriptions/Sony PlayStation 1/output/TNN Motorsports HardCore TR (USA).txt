As another addition to the off-road racing genre, TNN Motorsports HardCore TR features over 30 unique courses and 24 souped-up hotrods and all-terrain trucks customizable to your own preferences. Tracks span various locations throughout the United States ranging from the deserts and dirt trails of Arizona and the muddy swamps of Florida to the familiar wine valley landmarks of Northern California and the deep canyons of New Mexico.

Held together by a map outlining race locations, the gameplay options include an Arcade, Championship, Player, Time Trial and Test Track modes. After making various modifications to your truck, you'll want to select the Test Track in order to see whether or not those changes positively or negatively affected your vehicle. Once your truck's handling and feel is to your liking, its time for some competition!
