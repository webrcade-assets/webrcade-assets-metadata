Just like in real horse racing, no two races are alike: race outcomes are determined by racetrack, conditions, pack and luck. A great party game for players and spectators alike, you can be the jockey, or select watch mode, and be a spectator. As the jockey, you decide when to hold back, move inside, move outside and go for the lead horses even change lanes, get bumped, get blocked and lose ground on curves. The winners are put out to stud, and the losers, put out to pasture.
