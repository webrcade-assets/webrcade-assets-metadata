No One Can Stop Mr. Domino is a puzzle game which sees you controlling the titular Mr. Domino (or one of his friends, if you prefer) as he zips around levels which can be best described as a racetrack. As the title suggests, you can't actually stop Mr. Domino - however, you can guide him around the track, speed him up and slow him down. He'll need to dodge obstacles as he aims to activate "tricks" which are placed around the board.
