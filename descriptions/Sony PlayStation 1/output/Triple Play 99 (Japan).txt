This iteration of EA's baseball simulation adds 3D hardware support, a career mode, and a full-league draft. It features official Major League Baseball statistics and names of all teams and players from the 1998 season.

Other modes include single-game exhibition, home run derby, play-off, tournament, season and manager.

The new career mode allows you to play multiple seasons. Tournament mode allows you to create a custom tournament with up to eight teams.
