Based heavily in the LEGO universe, LEGO Rock Raiders takes the familiar LEGO characters and gives them personalities and a purpose: To get off the planet before they all get killed. To meet this objective, you will control all five of the characters in their own levels as they search for their coveted ore.

Each character has a different skill that he or she can utilize to beat their level. For instance, one LEGO hero can use their jetpack to jump greater distances, while another takes no damage from the radioactive water that permeates the underground passageways. In addition to these unique skills, each of your characters can drill into certain rock formations, destroying them and allowing you to pass. Dynamite can also be located, which you can use to set and explode charges that will explode stronger formations.
