Hear the roar of engines and smell the burnt rubber as you step up to take the challenge of Test Drive 5. Race on 18 different tracks in locations such as Moscow, Honolulu, Tokyo and the winding streets of San Francisco.

The interesting twist is that the courses are reversible giving you an total of 31 driving combinations. Add that to 40 cars including classics such as the Dodge Viper, Shelby Series 1, Jaguar XKR, Saleen S351, Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Mustang, and the Plymouth Hemi Barracuda among other super-charged and secret cars that will melt the asphalt beneath your tires.
