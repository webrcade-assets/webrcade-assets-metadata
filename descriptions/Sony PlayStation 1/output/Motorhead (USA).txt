Motorhead is a futuristic racing title featuring a total of ten playable cars on eight twisting courses, ranging from an industrial area to a desert. Each vehicle is individually rated in speed, acceleration, and grip. There are no weapons or power-ups to collect; it's just you, a friend, or the computer competing for the fastest time. Four play modes include Time Attack, League, Head-to-Head, and Single Race. Each mode offers the option to view the action at 30 or 60 frames per second, with the key difference being the number of computer-controlled cars on the track.
