Sure, you could race circles around your mother's feet with your old RC car, but can you handle professional racing in RC de GO? This game is all about those Radio Controlled cars that fascinate children and even adults across the country.

Grit your teeth and prepare yourself for racing; RC style! RC de GO is composed of 4 modes of play: Practice, Quick Race, Championship, and Time Attack. The practice mode is a tutorial that takes you through the controls of your RC car in a step-to-step course. After you've gone through the basics, you'll attempt a practice race.
