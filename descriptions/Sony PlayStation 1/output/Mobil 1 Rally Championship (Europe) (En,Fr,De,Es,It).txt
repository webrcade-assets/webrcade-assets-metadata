Mobil 1 Rally Championship offers fans of rally racing a variety of options. For some quick fun there's the Arcade mode, which doesn't require too much of a time commitment. There's also a Championship series, a set of Time Trials, and a Two-Player mode. In Championship mode, the cars are divided into four categories, and you set off on a total of six tournaments set throughout the British Isles. Each rally is made up of six races each having very different track and environmental conditions. With a total of 48 races, there's more than enough variety.
