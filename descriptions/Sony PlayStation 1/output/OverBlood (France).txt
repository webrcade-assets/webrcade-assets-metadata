OverBlood is a science fiction video game developed by Riverhillsoft and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation. It is considered one of the first survival horror games to make use of a fully three-dimensional virtual environment,[1] second only to Riverhillsoft's own Doctor Hauzer, a fully 3D survival horror game released for the 3DO in 1994.[2] The game was later made available on the Japanese PlayStation Network Store.[3]
