Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf is the fourth PlayStation golf title from Electronic Arts and first to promise you'll play 18 holes within 30 minutes. Play as the champion or one of seven other PGA Tour pros on five different 3D courses: TPC at Southwind, TPC at Summerlin, TPC at Las Colinas, TPC at Sawgrass and TPC of Scottsdale.

There are a total of eight different modes of play: Practice, Stroke Play, The Skins Game, Tournament, Shoot-Out, Foursome Match, Four Ball Match and Tour Play, with the latter making its debut in this release. Tour Play lets you play in a season of five four-round tournaments referred to as events. Participating in each event will earn you money, but the goal of winning the major is your main incentive.
