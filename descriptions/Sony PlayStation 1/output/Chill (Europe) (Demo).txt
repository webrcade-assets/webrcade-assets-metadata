Chill is designed to be the first game that accurately recreates the rush associated with flinging a fragile human body mounted on a half-centimetre thick piece of fibre glass down the side of a death-trap mountain slope. It combines speed, tricks and death-defying jumps into the most exciting, fast-paced game for a long time.
