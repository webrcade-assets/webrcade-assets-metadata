EA Sports is back with its newest version of the storied NHL franchise. In 2000, EA tries to add to the already in-depth game, and keeping the same features that made it the best before. It seems they have done it again. EA has introduced its career-mode, letting you play up to 10 seasons, trade, draft, watch your players grow old and nimble and retire. Sign some young studs and watch them grow into tomorrow?s superstars. Exhibition, Season, Career, Playoffs and even a skills challenge to tone your skills. NHL 2000 has everything you would possibly desire from a hockey game.
