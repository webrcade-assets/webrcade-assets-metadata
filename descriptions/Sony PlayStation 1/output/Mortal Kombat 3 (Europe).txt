MORTAL KOMBAT 3 is the third installment in this immensely popular and intensely gory series. Shao Kahn has assumed control of Earth and the Outworld, and now both are plunged into darkness, overrun by his barbaric beasts. You must clash with evil to restore order and put Shao Kahn in his place. Are you ready to sacrifice your soul in battle? Go toe-to-toe with 15 ruthless pugilists, including new fighters like Nightwolf, the four-armed Sheeva, riot cop Stryker, and Shao Kahn's evil bride Sindel. Of course, you'll also find your old favorites like Jax, Sonya, and Liu Kang. All of the moves from the arcade version are here as well, and you can also take on a friend and find out who is the king of kombat.
