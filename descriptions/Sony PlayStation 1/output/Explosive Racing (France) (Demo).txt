In the beginning, you start off with only two tracks, six vehicles, and the Practice and Championship modes. By successfully clearing the game modes in specific ways, you can unlock more tracks, vehicles and additional game modes. There's also a two player mode which can be accessed using the PlayStation Link Cable.
