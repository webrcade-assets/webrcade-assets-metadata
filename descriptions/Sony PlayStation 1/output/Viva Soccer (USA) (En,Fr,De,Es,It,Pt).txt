Viva Football by Virgin Interactive contains over 1,000 teams from the past World Cups. You can play as or against any of these teams, allowing you to create historical match-ups that can be relived in the comfort of your own home.

Whether you play alone against the computer or with up to three of your friends, you have access to over 16,000 real players, all with their own characteristics, changing the way that they play the game; it's your choice, and your choice alone. You can choose from Friendly, History or Training modes. In all of these modes you have full control over your team. Kick, block, tackle, clear, head, volley, redirect, chip or pass just like your player's real-life counterparts do.
