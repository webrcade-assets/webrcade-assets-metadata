Elemental Gearbolt is your typical "save the world from the evil lunatic who wishes to destroy all of mankind for his own tyrannical reasons" story. In this case, a power hungry prince is plotting this scenario by using the Neural Network Computer, which happens to keep the world in balance. He wishes to destroy this machine, which feeds on volunteers, or Elementals. Once you die, your soul is fed to this machine which makes you an Elemental. Such is the case with the two sisters' Nell and Seana. But what the prince did not know is that he caused their death and now the two Elementals are out for his blood and to save all of mankind.
