ECW Hardcore Revolution is a professional wrestling video game released by Acclaim Entertainment, based on the professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). The game was released for the Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color. It was the first wrestling game to be based on ECW, as well as the first professional wrestling game to receive a Mature rating from the ESRB, although the Game Boy Color version was rated Everyone. Acclaim followed this title with the release of a sequel, ECW Anarchy Rulz, six months after this game was released. (From Wikipedia)
