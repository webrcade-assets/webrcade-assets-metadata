Neo･Geo CD Special (ネオジオＣＤスペシャル) is an omnibus game released on December 22, 1995. It was created to showcase the console's capabilities for curious consumers by letting them sample six titles. The game's interface is staged as a class with a polygon Athena Asamiya as the mascot/teacher and the sampled games are the "classes". She was voiced by Masae Yumi, which is her first role at SNK.
