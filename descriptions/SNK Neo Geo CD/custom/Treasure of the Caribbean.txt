Treasure of the Caribbean is an unreleased puzzle game developed by Face for the Neo Geo, originally slated for release in 1994. The game was cancelled while still early in its development, with the only evidence left of its existence being a small preview published on the Gamest magazine in 1994. The game would feature three selectable characters and would likely have a similar gameplay to other tile-stacking puzzles such as Columns.
