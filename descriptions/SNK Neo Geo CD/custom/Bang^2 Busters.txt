
BangÂ² Busters (also called Bang Bang Busters) is an single-screen platformer developed by Visco for the Neo Geo, originally slated for release in 1994, but ultimately released in 2010. The game was reportedly complete but cancelled for unknown reasons. It was reconsidered to get released in 2000 by SNK themselves (much like what they did with Zupapa!) but ultimately cancelled again. In 2010, Neo Conception International obtained the rights to Bang Bang Busters from Visco to print a limited amount of copies for the Neo Geo. Neo Geo CD copies would release in 2012, and a Sega Dreamcast release would follow in 2018.
