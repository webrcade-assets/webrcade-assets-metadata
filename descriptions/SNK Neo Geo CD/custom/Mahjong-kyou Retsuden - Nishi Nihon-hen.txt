Mahjong Kyōretsuden: Nishi Nihon-hen (麻雀狂列伝 -西日本編-, Mahjong Enthusiast: West Japan Edition) is a mahjong simulator released in 1990 for the Neo Geo as a launch title in Japan only and later ported in 1994 for the Neo Geo CD. It supports the Neo Geo Mahjong controller, which was originally made specifically for this game, and it also allows the use of memory cards to transfer saves between the MVS and AES versions of the game.
