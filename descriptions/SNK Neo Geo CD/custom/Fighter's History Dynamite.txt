Fighter's History Dynamite is a 2D versus fighting game similar to Street Fighter II. It takes place one year after what happened in Fighter's History. After being defeated in The "Great Grapple", a martial arts tournament organized by himself, the mysterious K invites fighters from all over the world once again. The nine characters from the previous game (Ray, Feilin, Ryoko, Matlok, Samchay, Lee, Mizoguchi, Jean and Marstorius) are present, along with two new ones (Yungmie and Zazie). The two hidden characters from the previous game, Clown and Karnov, are also available as playable characters in this game.
