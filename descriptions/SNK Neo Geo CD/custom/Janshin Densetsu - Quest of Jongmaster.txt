Quest of Jongmaster is a mahjong game with role-playing elements. The "RPG mode" follows the story of an apprentice "mahjong warrior", a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration, NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.
