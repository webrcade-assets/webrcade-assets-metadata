Kabuki Klash is a 2D fighting game that features characters from the Japanese role-playing series Tengai Makyō, also known as Far East of Eden. The heroes of the three first Tengai Makyō games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters.
