Ragnagard, known as Shinouken (神凰拳, God Phoenix Fist) in Japan, is a 2D fighting game that was developed by Saurus and System Vision and published by SNK for the Neo Geo. It was first released in arcades on July 26, 1996. The game uses pre-rendered 3d polygons for their backgrounds and characters, creating a crisp and clear visual difference from other 2d fighters of its time. Fighting takes place on the ground and in the air, a unique fighting system that advertised the title as an "aerial battle action game".
