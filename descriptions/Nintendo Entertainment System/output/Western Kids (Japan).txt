The player controls the role of a young gunslinger who travels the land fighting villains and playing minigames. The main game play involves you moving around the towns horizontally collecting gold by hitting chest while killing the bad guys at the same time. There is also an RPG element where people have to be visited in towns for information. Once a player has acquired the required gear to be made sherrif, an outlaw must be killed for bonus money. A shooting range is included where players have to shoot down enemy targets while avoiding the targets that represent innocent bystanders.
