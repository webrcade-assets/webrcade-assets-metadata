Players control one of six camp counselors in a sidescrolling adventure perspective. The counselor starts with an arcing rock, attempting to find and kill Jason. Along the paths, players will find cabins, a lake, and caves, with all but the cabins having enemies such as zombies, crows, and wolves attacking the player-character. Players may upgrade their weapon upon finding a new one. A timed alarm appears at certain intervals, requiring players to find Jason before he kills a child or another counselor. Using the map, players must navigate their way to Jason's location and defeat him. If they do not make it there in time, Jason will kill the counselors and children.
