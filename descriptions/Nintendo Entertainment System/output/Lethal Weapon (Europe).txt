You know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. It doesn't get rougher or trougher than the streets of L.A., where Riggs and Murtaugh take on every cheap low-life mercenary, street punk and dope dealer to get to the real slime behind big-time corruption. How much of your life, your future, are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh?
