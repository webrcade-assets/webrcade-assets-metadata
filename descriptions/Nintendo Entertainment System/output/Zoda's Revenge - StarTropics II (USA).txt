The story begins with Mike Jones, the protagonist, receiving a telepathic message from Mica, the princess of the Argonians, whom Mike had rescued in the previous game. She tells Mike how to solve a cipher that he and his uncle, referred to as Dr. J, found on the side of the Argonians' space pod. Mike goes to see Dr. J, and together, they solve the cipher and read it aloud. This causes Mike to be flung into the past. He arrives in the Stone Age. After helping a tribe of cave men retrieve their children from a flesh-eating wild boar, he finds an object, which Mica telepathically identifies as a Tetrad ("Block" in the Virtual Console version). He must travel to different eras throughout Earth's history and retrieve the rest of the Tetrads.
