While maintaining basic baseball elements of pitching, batting, fielding, and base running, Base Wars adds a fighting element to the game featuring four robot classes; a traditional cyborg that looks more like an android, a tank, a flybot, and lastly a motorcycle. A player's robots can be upgraded with new and advanced weaponry and repaired with money earned for game wins during tournaments.
