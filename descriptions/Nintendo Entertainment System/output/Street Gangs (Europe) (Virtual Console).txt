The plot follows high school students Alex and Ryan (Kunio and Riki in the Japanese version) as they cross River City in an attempt to rescue River City High and Ryan's girlfriend Cyndi from the clutches of a villain called "Slick". Along the way, they battle with gangs of students (with names such as "The Generic Dudes" or "The Frat Guys") and several bosses and sub-bosses. Enemies will warrant a yell and drop money signifying their defeat, including the well known phrase "BARF!"
