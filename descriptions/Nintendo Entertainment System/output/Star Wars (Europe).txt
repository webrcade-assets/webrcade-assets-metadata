This side-scrolling platformer loosely follows the story of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope as you explore the caves of Tatooine, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo, blast off to the Death Star, rescue Princess Leia, and join the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin. You start the game as Luke Skywalker, but you can switch to Han Solo or Princess Leia once you find them in the game.
