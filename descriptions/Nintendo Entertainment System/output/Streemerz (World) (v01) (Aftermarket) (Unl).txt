“Try climbing to the top of this one by throwing streamers and climbing them. On your way up you better watch out for the various pie throwing clowns, burning candles and bouncing balls, because if they get you, you’ll die a little each time.” These were the orders given to you, Operative JOE when you were ordered to infiltrate the evil MASTER Y’s floating fortress to destroy the TIGER ARMY’s top secret weapon.

Streemerz is an NES homebrew that draws its inspiration from an Action 52 game with the same name. Using your trusty streamer, the player grapples platforms in order to navigate the level and avoid killer clowns. The gameplay is reminiscent of any Spiderman game, as he uses his web to climb walls.
