PAC-MAN is ready at your command to blaze around the baffling maze, gobbling up dots, swallowing the occasional fruits and racking up points in a big way! Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, the not-so-friendly ghosts, are dying to do some gobbling, too. Except their favorite food is PAC-MAN! His only defense is to eat the energizers, special pellets which enable PAC-MAN to gobble the ghosts - but only for a short while! And like all good ghosts, they come right back to haunt you. As you clear each maze, the ghosts move faster. Remember, it's a jungle out there. So gobble - or get gobbled!
