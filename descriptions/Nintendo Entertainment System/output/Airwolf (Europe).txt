From the outside, Airwolf looks like a sophisticated executive helicopter. Slick. Self-contained. Harmless. Which means it can slip in and out of airports without causing much suspicion.
But from the inside, its true military strength is revealed; walls of computerized controls, a satellite tracking system for locating enemies and allies, and a weapons guidance system for launching missiles and firing machine guns.
