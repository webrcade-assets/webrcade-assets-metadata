StarTropics was released in the United States for the Nintendo Entertainment System on December 1, 1990. Star Tropics is an anomaly in that the game was developed exclusively for American and European audiences, and has never seen the light of day in Japan. The game was developed by a team of Japanese game designers living in the U.S., the same team responsible for the Punch-Out!! games. The game has been re-released on the Wii virtual console for both North American and PAL regions as of January 2008.
