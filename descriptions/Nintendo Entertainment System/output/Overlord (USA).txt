Imagine, if you will, a universe that holds only a small group of planets. Each planet, a barren shell waiting to be given life. Imagine further, that within this universe there exists the forces of good and evil.
Having only a single Starbase to work from, you set out in ships of your own design and use them to colonize the barren planets. Strategies are needed to meet the many challenges you will face as you strive to become a great leader. Farms need to be established to feed your growing populous. Taxes have to be imposed to raise money to build a stunning array of equipment... from a spy satellite to a hydroponic planet.
Even while you are establishing that delicate balance called life, a fiendish dictator is gazing at the whole universe with greedy eyes. He schemes to conquer and control. Confrontation is inevitable!
