It is the second licensed game based on the 1960s Flintstones television series (the first being The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino & Hoppy). This game was never released in Japan unlike its prequel. It was released only to Blockbuster Video in August 1994. In this game, the player can switch playable characters between both Fred and Barney, and they both have different attacks and abilities; in the original, the only playable character is Fred. It is known to be the second rarest commercially-released licensed title for the NES (behind Stadium Events) due to being a Blockbuster-rental only game and copies on eBay rarely go below $200 USD.
