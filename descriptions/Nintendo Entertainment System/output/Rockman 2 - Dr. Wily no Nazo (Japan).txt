Mega Man 2 takes place after the original Mega Man, which is set in an unspecified year during the 21st century (the year 200X). Dr. Wily, the series' main antagonist, builds a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen, led by eight new Robot Masters of his design. Mega Man is sent by his creator, Dr. Light, to defeat Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters. Mega Man crushes the eight new Robot Masters and then challenges Wily himself. In the final fight, Mega Man defeats Dr. Wily's holographic projection device. After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.
