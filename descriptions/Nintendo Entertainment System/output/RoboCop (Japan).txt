A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad, a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play. It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of old Detroit - it's going to take RoboCop. "Your move, creep."
