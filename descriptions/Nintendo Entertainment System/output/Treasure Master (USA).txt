Treasure Master is a side-scrolling action game that sends your character on a quest of treasure acquisition. Jump your way through a variety of world environments including the islands, microprocessor-level circuitry, and the moon, and accumulate all of the material wealth you can possibly amass. You have a number of enemies to beware of (such as sharks, caterpillars, and springs). But you also have an impressive array of tools to help you in your quest (moon buggy!).
