Paperboy 2 is a sequel to the video game Paperboy.  Much like the original the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.
