You palm sweats as you grip your Zapper light gun. The Outlaw's eyes flash. He yells "Fire!" And suddenly you're in the middle of a Wild West shootout! Get the Outlaw before he gets you, and you'll win a reward! But watch out - the more you win the tougher it becomes, because this gunman has some very nasty friends. You can take on one outlaw, two outlaws - or the whole wild gang. And you up to the action? Because it's fast and furious in this quick -on- the-trigger Nintendo Light Gun game!
