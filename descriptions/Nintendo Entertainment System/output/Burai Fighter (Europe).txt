Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling shooting video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.  The setting for Burai Fighter, according to the manual, is to fend off seven bases of Burai, super-intelligent cyborgs.  The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser and missile weapons, which are much more powerful.  The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross and Ace, but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked.  One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.
