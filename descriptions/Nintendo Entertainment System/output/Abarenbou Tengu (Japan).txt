Zombie Nation is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. The hero's designation as a "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally: Namakubi is indeed a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts; health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with two difficulty settings.
