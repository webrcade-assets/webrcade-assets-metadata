The player takes control of the title character, Billy West, who must fight save to his girlfriend Annabelle Lane from the gang of Godfather Gordon. There are a total of ten stages in all: six side-scrolling beat-em-up stages (or street fighting stages, as the game actually dubs them), two light gun shooting (shoot-'em-up) stages, and two action driving stages.
