The game is a racing video game. The player directs the car using the D-pad, accellerating with A and braking with B. The gauges, speed and several other things can be seen at the bottom of the screen. A turbo boost can be used when necessary, but must be refueled when empty. Hazards such as signposts and other cars must be avoided. Qualifying is held prior to each race, but is difficult because only one lap is given.
