The plot involves the Frankenstein monster returning from the dead and kidnapping a girl, Emily. The hero (who is named by the player), a young adventurer, has to go rescue her. During his journey, he fights several fantasy and other undead creatures that have also invaded his village and the surroundings (including the Grim Reaper). The hero will then have to fight the Frankenstein monster (who is referred to in this game as "Frankenstein") at the end.
