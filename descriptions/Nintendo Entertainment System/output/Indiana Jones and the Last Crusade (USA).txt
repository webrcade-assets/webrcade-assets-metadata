Grab your bullwhip, dust off your fedora, and race into worlds of action, intrigue and adventure. Now you can become Indiana Jones and embark on the quest for the Holy Grail. Travel across three continents with six action arcade sequences to rescue your dad, recover lost relics, and keep the Grail Diary safe from the Gestapo! Just like the real Indy, you call the shots. You decide where to search next. Brunwald Castle? Iskenderun? The Temple? The final adventures are the toughest. Dad was right! Against Nazis, spies, tanks and traitors, you don't get a silver medal for finishing second!
