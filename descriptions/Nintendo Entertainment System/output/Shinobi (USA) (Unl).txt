Shinobi is about a ninja named Joe Musashi who has to stop a criminal organization called "Zeed" who are kidnapping the children of the Oboro clan. Through five missions, each with three or four stages, Musashi must make his way to Zeed's headquarters and free all the hostages before confronting the bosses at the final stage of each mission.
