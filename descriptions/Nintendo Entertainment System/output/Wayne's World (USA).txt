"Wayne's World, Wayne's World! Party time! Excellent! Woo, woo, woo!"

It's Friday, it's 10:30 and like usual, Wayne and Garth are presenting their TV show. First they start off by reading a top-10 list of the worst games they recently played at the arcade. Then Wayne accounts on how he and Garth were suddenly sucked into a video game, and Garth was kidnapped by the mysterious Zantar. "Weeuuu, weeuuu, weeuuu!" FLASHBACK, and now you're suddenly in control of Wayne as he must embark upon a quest to save his good pal Garth.
