A very fun 2-4 player Spacewar!/Thrust/Gravity force style game with destructable environments. At least two players are needed to start the game. Hold button A at the start menu to begin a game. The game will begin after the counter counts to zero. In two player games, you need to get two kills in a round before the level ends. In three or four player games, the level ends when there is only one ship remaining.
