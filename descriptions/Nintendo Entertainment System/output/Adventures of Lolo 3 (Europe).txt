From the Adventures of Lolo 3 manual:
Lolo, Lala and their friends have lived peacefully for many years, ever since the defeat of the Great Devil (in The Adventures of Lolo 2). But suddenly his son and heir, the new King of Eggerland, launched a hollow capsule filled with a strange potion that turns the inhabitants of Lolo and Lala's tiny kingdom to stone. Only Lolo and Lala, basking in the sun at the edge of the lake between the two kingdoms, were spared this horrible fate. Brave in the face of adversity, our hero and heroine set out together to defeat the evil King and cast off his spell. Only you can help our brave pair now
