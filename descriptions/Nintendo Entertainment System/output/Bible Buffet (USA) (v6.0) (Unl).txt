This is a Bible trivia/action game in which you spin a spinner and move the number of spaces it says.

When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, upgraded or better weapons, hearts, etc. If the space you land on has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces.
