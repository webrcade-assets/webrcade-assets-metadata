The game consists of seven levels that take you through various locales: A Swiss Alps-style mountain, a cavern, a mine, a submarine, a haunted ship, a port town, and a castle. Mini-games were available at certain points that allowed you to collect extra lives. These mini-games were Peabody and Sherman, where you controlled Sherman and blew bubble gum bubbles to clog a dragon's mouth, and Dudley Do-Right, where you rode a horse and avoided an ever-approaching train which was driven by Snidely Whiplash.
