The Fire Emblem series of turn-based tactics games centers around moving units through a map grid in order to defeat the opposition. Players use strategic movements and positioning to complete mission objectives such as seizing a base, surviving for a number of turns, or defeating a boss. Many conventions of traditional console role-playing games are also present; for example, there is extensive use of scripted cutscenes to advance the story, units gain experience points and grow stronger over the course of the campaign, and the player can visit shops to outfit characters with weapons and equipment. Depending on the game, these events may take place during or in-between battles.
The combat system bases itself on a rock-paper-scissors method of fighting, as each weapon type has both an advantage and a disadvantage against other types. Starting in the fourth game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu, the weapon triangle has been lance beats sword, sword beats axe, and axe beats lance. Bows are unaffected by the triangle, can attack from a distance, and do higher amounts of damage against flying units like pegasi, but this is offset by the bow-wielder's inability to counter-attack melee strikes. A similar magic triangle exists in some games. In the Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem games, light beats dark, dark beats anima, and anima beats light. In other games, fire beats wind, wind beats thunder, and thunder beats fire. Magic and certain axes and spears can be used either from a distance or in melee range.
Unlike in most other games, most weapons in the Fire Emblem series have a finite number of uses and will eventually break. Therefore, the player must often buy replacement weapons or spend gold to have broken weapons repaired. Typically, weaker weapons allow more uses than more powerful ones, and are often more accurate.
