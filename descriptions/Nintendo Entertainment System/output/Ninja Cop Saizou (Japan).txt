Wrath of the Black Manta is a side-scrolling arcade-style action game with five different levels. Throughout each level the player may come across various clues to help him find where to go next, or discover a hidden location. Some of the bad guys Black Manta comes across may also possess useful knowledge and can be interrogated if they don't kill him first.
