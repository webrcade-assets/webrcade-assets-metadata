Solar Jetman is on a one-man rescue mission to recover the most powerful spacecraft in the galaxy - The Golden Warpship. But first he must survive the 12 deadly alien worlds which hide the sabotaged vessel's parts, each with its own legion of menacing obstacles. Devastating gravitational forces, vicious alien armies, paralyzing booby traps, cosmic space warps, and mysterious black holes stand in the way. It's all up to Jetman's quick wits and galactic combat skills to carry him through the Herculean tasks that lie ahead. Only then can The Golden Warpship continue on its original mission.
