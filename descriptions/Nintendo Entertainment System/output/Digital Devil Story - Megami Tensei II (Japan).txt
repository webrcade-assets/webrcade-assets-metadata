Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is the sequel to Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. It was published by Namco in 1990 for the Family Computer and is the second video game in the Megami Tensei series. This is the first game in the series to not be based on the original novels by Aya Nishitani, but it retains much of the gameplay aspects of its predecessor. The music in the game is enhanced by an eight-channel Namco 163 WSG sound chip on the cartridge.

Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II retains several gameplay aspects of the first game, including demon catching and fusing and first-person dungeons.

There is a world map that features overhead graphics. The player controls the party through the world map and dungeons, fighting enemies in random encounters with turn-based combat. Transportation such as rail and highway that existed at the end of the 20th century does not exist; movement by foot is the most common activity in the game. There is a big hole in the ground that limits the player's explorations. Underground passage appear in the guise of former subway tracks. 3D dungeons have been adopted in this game for beginning player. However, there were many glitches and disruptions that occur under auto pilot, causing it to hang under certain conditions.

When both the hero and his partners are dead, the game over screen consists of the underworld ferryman Charon picking up a soul.
