Dragon Ball Z II: Gekishin Frieza!! (ZII !! Doragon Bru Zetto Ts Gekishin Furza!!?, Dragon Ball Z II: Frieza the Planet Destroyer!!) was released by Bandai on August 10, 1991 in Japan for the Famicom. The game features the story on Namek and follows closely to the story in the anime except for the fact that, like in the previous game, Teinshinhan, Yamucha and Chaozu are not dead but are present in the player's party at the beginning.
