A captured P.O.W. commando codenamed Snake (Bart in the NES version) must bomb his way out of a P.O.W. prison cell and escape. During gameplay, the player must fight through four levels where the mission is not only to escape, but to infiltrate the enemy base and destroy their leaders. There are brass-knuckles, body armor, knives, grenades and machine guns that the players can use in order to aid them in their mission.
