Dragon Ball: Daima Fukkatsu ( Doragon Bru Daima Fukkatsu?, lit. Dragon Ball: Great Demon King's Revival) was released in Japan for the Famicom on August 12, 1988 by Bandai. It takes place during the Piccolo Daimao Saga. It was one of the first games to have a board game, which included battles using cards. The battle card games are a hybrid of role playing games, board games and trading cards. The players move around a game board and encounter characters on the way. Some characters offer information and others need to be battled. The outcome of each fight is determined by the randomly generated hand of cards players and the opponent are dealt. The player flips over cards in a certain order, and their actions are shown in an animated battle that lasts until one of the characters is defeated.
