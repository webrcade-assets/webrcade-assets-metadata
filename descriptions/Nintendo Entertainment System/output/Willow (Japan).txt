Long ago, in a time of magic and sorcery, an evil sorceress named Queen Bavmorda ruled the land under a reign of terror.
A baby has been born who, legend foretells, will destroy the wicked ruler but the Queen vows the slay the child first. Now the villagers of Nelwyn must band together to assist Willow, the child's chosen protector.
As Willow, you must travel through mysterious forests and villages - first evading the Queen and her demons, then plotting to end her reign of terror. You will accumulate an arsenal of swords, shield, and most importantly magic, which are necessary for your final confrontation. Outnumbered by the Nockmaar Army, you must rely on inner strength and determination to destroy the evil Queen - before it's too late!
