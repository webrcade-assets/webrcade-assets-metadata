Despite being rather short on story and depth, this game was nevertheless fairly popular. The game flashes three "cardboard cut-outs" of a mixture of bad guys and innocent civilians. The player needs to react quickly and shoot the thugs while sparing the bystanders and other friendlies (such as police officers). The game gets more difficult and faster as it progresses
