That's right, folks, the cartoon you know and love is ready to roll again - except this time you get to be Road Runner!
The desert's plenty dangerous all by itself; falling boulders, oncoming trucks, land mines and cannon balls as well as mazes, sand traps and ravines.
Throw in that crafty Wile E. Coyote and you've got one wild-goose chase that's fun, fast and exciting!
He may not be too bright, but he is hungry. And he's got his rocket, jet skates, pogo stick and helicopter.
Better get cookin' before you get cooked.
