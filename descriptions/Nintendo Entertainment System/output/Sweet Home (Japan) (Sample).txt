Sweet Home, a survival horror RPG, is about a team of five explorers who must uncover the secrets within the Mamiya mansion and escape its eldritch halls before it's too late!  Based on the eponymous Japanese horror movie, this innovative Famicom title would go on to influence a later Capcom classic, Resident Evil.
