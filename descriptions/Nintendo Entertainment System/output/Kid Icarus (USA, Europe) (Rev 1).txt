Kid Icarus is a platforming video game in which the player controls Pit in sprite-rendered two-dimensional landscapes. Pit starts the game with a bow and arrows as his only weapon, and with only the ability to jump. The player explores more areas and collects power-ups that grant Pit special abilities and enhance his armor and weaponry. The gameplay incorporates elements of action and adventure games.
