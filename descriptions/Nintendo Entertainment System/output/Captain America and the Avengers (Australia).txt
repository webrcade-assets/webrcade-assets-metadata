Players can choose to play as one of four members of the Avengers: Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and the Vision.  Each character can fight hand-to-hand, throw select items on the ground and launch either projectile weapons (Captain America's shield and Hawkeye's arrows) or energy beams (Iron Man and Vision).  Other Avengers, including the Wasp, Quicksilver, Wonder Man and Namor the Sub-Mariner, appear when special power-ups are collected, allowing those characters to temporarily assist the players' characters.  The Red Skull has assembled an army of super villians and other henchmen in a plot to take over the world.  Along with battling generic enemies, players also face Klaw, the Living Laser, Whirlwind, The Sentinels, Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, The Juggernaut, Ultron and the assassin Crossbones.  Most game levels feature side-scrolling fighting with free movement as in traditional arcade brawlers. Occasionally, players take flight for side-scrolling flying & shooting sequences; Iron Man and Vision fly on their own while Captain America and Hawkeye use flying machines.
