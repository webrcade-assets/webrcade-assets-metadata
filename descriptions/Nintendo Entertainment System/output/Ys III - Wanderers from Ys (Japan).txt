The perspective of Ys III is a sharp departure from the previous two games. Instead of the previously used top-down camera view, Ys III uses a side-scrolling platformer presentation. Auto-attack is removed; the player must push a button to make Adol attack enemies. As in previous entries, however, neither the player character nor the enemies have temporary invincibility.

Otherwise, the gameplay mechanics are identical to previous entries in the series. The statistics, equipment, shopping, experience system, and magic all function the same as in Ys I and II (though spells are represented by rings instead of wand icons, and MP is renamed "Ring Power").
