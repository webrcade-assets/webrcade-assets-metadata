Magic Kid Googoo is a Korean unlicensed platform game developed by Zemina in 1992 for the Famicom. From Zemina's history of games they released, this is the only game for the aforementioned console.
In this game, the main character is a kid named Googoo (who seems to be wearing a karate uniform) and its attack ability consists on lifting rocks and throwing them at enemies or pots that contain items such as magic capsules, money (called as "food") or a letter (if the player collects all the letters for EXTRA, an extra life is rewarded). By pausing, Googoo can use special powers or turn into other temporary characters (the latter consumes magic count). "Food" is collected through the levels or by playing the bonus minigames, and it includes an item shop as well, accessible after quitting from a minigame. The game contains 7 worlds, each of them with a boss after a temple level and a password to access directly.
