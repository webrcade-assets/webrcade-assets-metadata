The gameplay and the design haven't much changed since Adventure Island II.  There is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike Adventure Island, where each large level contained several stages).  You perform standard "adventure island" activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones and, of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.
