In Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo or Hercules).  After defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels as in the Action 52 version.  Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.  Cheetahmen II is famous for its music and for its lack of quality in all other areas.  Like Action 52, it was not licensed by Nintendo.
