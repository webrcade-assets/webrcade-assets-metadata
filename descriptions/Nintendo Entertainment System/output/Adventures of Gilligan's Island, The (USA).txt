"Okay little buddy, you just stay right behind your old pal the Skipper and everything's gonna be just fine. All we have to do is follow these clues and find the magic stone tablet and we can get off this forsaken island once and for all. So Gilligan, please try not to mess things up just this one time. Stay away from the quicksand and don't go wandering off into any dark caves. Can you promise me that, little buddy? Little buddy? Now where has he gone to? Gilligan, get out of that tree and stop messing around!! OK, just walk right in my footsteps and don't cause any more trouble or we could be stuck doing reruns forever! OK, little buddy? Gilligan? Gilligan!!"
