Battle Tank is an action video game released by Absolute Entertainment in September 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  The game is similar to the Atari game Battlezone, and supports one player.  It was considered to be a poorly designed game, as it was intended to become a space flight game for the Commodore 64 during its development.
