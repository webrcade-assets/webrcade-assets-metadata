Radia Senki: Reimmeihen (   ?, lit. "Chronicle of the Radia War") is an Action RPG for the Nintendo Family Computer created by Tecmo, and released in Japan on November 15, 1991. Though an English release was at one point planned, it was never released outside of Japan, with only a prototype ever made. There is a fan translation patch available for this game which allows the game to be played in English.[2]

Radia Senki follows a cast of characters trying to stop the domination of Lemuria by Gadiss, a political leader. The main protagonist suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the game, but he does regain his memories by the conclusion of the story.

The game was directed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who also worked on Ninja Gaiden while at Tecmo, and later the Klonoa series for Namco.
