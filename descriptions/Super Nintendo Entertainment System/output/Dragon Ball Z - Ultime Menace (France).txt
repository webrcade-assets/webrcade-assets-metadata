Dragon Ball Z 3: Ultime Menace features ten playable characters based on the Majin Buu Saga. Unlike its predecessors, there is no story mode in the game. Instead, the Tournament Mode seems to double as the story mode for the game as when a character is crowned the champion, the credits start rolling.
