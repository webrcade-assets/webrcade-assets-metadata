Bram Stoker's Dracula" for the Super NES goes straight for the jugular with spine-chilling action so real you won't believe your eyes. As vampire hunter Jonathan Marker, you're plunged deep into the world of the undead in this ultimate interactive movie.

By day, you'll fight bloodthirsty bats and poisonous spiders in your search for weapons. As the sun sets, beware... because now the Prince of Darkness himself arises and comes for you... as bat, wolf, even as an old man. Bram Stoker's Dracula. Make no mistake... he must be stopped!
