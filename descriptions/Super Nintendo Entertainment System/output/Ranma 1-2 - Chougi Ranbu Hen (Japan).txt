Ranma : Chougi Rambuhen (1/2 ), alternatively spelled as Chougi Ranbu Hen, is one of three Ranma  fighting games that was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was to have been released in the United States as the sequel to Ranma : Hard Battle as Ranma  II: Anything Goes Martial Arts by DTMC, which had adapted Bakuretsu Rantou-hen into Hard Battle. However DTMC's going out of business precluded this from happening, resulting in cancellation. The title directly translates as "Super Skill Wild Dance Chapter", but it is commonly referred to as "Super Hard Battle".
