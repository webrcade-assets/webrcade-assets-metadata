Final Fight is set in the fictional American metropolis of Metro City, where a former professional wrestler named Mike Haggar is elected Mayor, promising to handle the city's criminal problem in his campaign. The Mad Gear gang, the dominant criminal organization of the city, plots to bring Haggar under their control by kidnapping his daughter Jessica and using her as leverage against him. Enlisting the help of Cody, Jessica's boyfriend and a Martial Arts master himself, as well as Cody's sparring partner, a Ninjutsu master named Guy, Haggar opts to fight the gang instead in order to save his daughter.
