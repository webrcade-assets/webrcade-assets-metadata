A day at the movies for a young boy and his dog turns into an adventure that spans across several different time periods and locations.  Can you and your companion discover the secret of Evermore and find your way home?  Produced by the North American branch of Square, Evermore's soundtrack would be the first major work by Jeremy Soule, the famed Elder Scrolls composer.
