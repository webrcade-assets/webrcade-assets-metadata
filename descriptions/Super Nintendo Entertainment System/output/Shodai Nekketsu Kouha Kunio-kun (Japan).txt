Shodai Nekketsu Kouha (hereafter "Kunio") is an interesting fusion of 
the RPG and Beatemup genres of gameplay. You wander the streets of Osaka, 
getting into fights (randomly, if you don't start them yourself), beating 
people up, gaining items and experience, and levelling up. If you've 
played River City Ransom, you'll feel right at home - same series, really. 
Money has been replaced by random drops and experience, though; you can 
buy stuff from vending machines, but they take the generic "prepaid cash 
card" currency, at an exchange rate of one cash card for one item. You 
can also spend cash cards on crane games, slot machines, and fortune- 
telling machines, once you find a game center.
