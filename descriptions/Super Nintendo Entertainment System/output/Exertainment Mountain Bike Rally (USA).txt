The player starts in qualifying, and as he/she plays the game more frequently, he/she can qualify for the regionals, nationals, the championship, and the grueling final race where he/she must get first place in order to beat the game. Players will spend literally hours in the easier modes and this game is like exercise for his/her thumbs.
