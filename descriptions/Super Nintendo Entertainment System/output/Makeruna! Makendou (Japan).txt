In Kendo Rage, the player takes control of Josephine. She can move left and right, jump, duck and attack with her bamboo sword. Josephine's psychic powers are shown on a bar and recharge gradually at a steady pace, changing color as they do. Depending on the color, an attack done will use up the current psychic energy and let loose a stronger attack, usually a projectile. Additionally, Josephine can summon flames around herself during a rush attack, at the cost of some energy. The game lasts seven levels, with a boss finishing off each level.
