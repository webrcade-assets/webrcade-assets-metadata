Hard Battle has three modes of play: the standard 1 player tournament mode, a 2 player competitive mode, and a 2 player five-character team challenge mode. There are ten characters in the game (twelve if Ranma and Pantyhose Taro's cursed forms are counted). All twelve characters are available for the 2 player modes. After completing tournament mode Pantyhose becomes a playable tournament character. Happosai is unlockable by entering a code.
