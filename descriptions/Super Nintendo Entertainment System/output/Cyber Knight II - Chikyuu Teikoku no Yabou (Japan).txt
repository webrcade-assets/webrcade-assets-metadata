Cyber Knight 2 is a direct story sequel to the original (whose translation was also done by Aeon Genesis.) After the Swordfishs crew reappears in known space, they are apprehended and imprisoned by the Earth Federation, a new military dictator having seized all of the Swordfishs alien technology developed in the distant galaxy. It is a time of civil war amongst the federated planets, and the crew has been thrown directly into the center! Soon, new weapons called Metalliforms are created, which the General intends to use to conquer the galaxy!

This things moved really fast. It took just under two months, but its at the point where the game is not only fully playable, but its also one of the nicest pieces of work Ive done yet. Seriously, the hacking on this is really pretty. Variable-width font for the main dialogue, multi-line 8x8, text hacked to allow more space... You name it, this things got all the bells and whistles.

The gameplay is fantastic, too. Its got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over. This game is seriously amazing, folks. I havent had this much fun playtesting a game since Shin Megami Tensei. Even if you didnt like the original Cyber Knight, chances are youll love this one. The storys better, theres an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your "inactive" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin... The list goes on! Its done and there shouldnt be any problems, so play and enjoy!
