Japan-only shooter construction kit for the Super Famicom system. Use a simple, icon-based menu system to execute commands. A paint program-style sprite editor lets you design your own friendly and enemy avatars from scratch and give them specific properties. You can also design your own title screen and use a BGM studio editor to compose music for use in the game. Music input is handled via instrument icons that can be assigned to music sheets. Dezaemon includes a sample shooting game called DAIOH.
