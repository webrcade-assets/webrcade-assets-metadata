You are the leader of a band of rebels who have fought to preserve the last shred of honor in this desperate time of treachery.

Manage the ranks of a full-blown rebel army complete with hundreds of characters, magic items, weapons, and mystical Tarot cards. You must succeed in ousting the evil usurpers, as your fate, and that of the entire population, depends on it!
