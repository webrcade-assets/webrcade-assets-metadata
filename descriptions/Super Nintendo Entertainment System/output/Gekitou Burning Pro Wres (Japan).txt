When Human Entertainment's seminal Fire Pro series first hit at the very beginning of the 16-bit era, it didn't just redefine how Japanese wrestling games played, it also set a standard for customization and content that completely revolutionized the genre. By the time that the series' final SFC installment was released, it had a good half dozen different modes of play, control of the rules of each match, four player capability, a roster reaching into triple digits, and a create-a-character mode that's still without peer in any genre.
