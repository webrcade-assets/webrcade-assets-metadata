The story of Mega Man X3 revolves around a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler. In the year 21XX, the threat of the Mavericks had been neutralized thanks to Doppler's technology, which prevented the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids had formed a utopia near their new mentor called Doppler Town. It seemed that all was well, until the former Maverick Reploids suddenly reverted and once again began causing trouble. Dr. Doppler was held accountable, and X and Zero were sent out to contain the new threat. Once Zero and X defeat Dr. Doppler and his forces, Dr. Doppler snaps out of it and realizes all the damage that he has done. He reiterates that Sigma's true form is now a computer virus, and he realizes that he was corrupted to create a new body for him. X seeks out Sigma after thanking the doctor. After an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to possess him. After X finds himself at a deadend, one of two things may happen. In the main ending, Zero takes Dr. Doppler's true antivirus and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, taking out the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero was injured during the game, the worse scenario occurs - Dr. Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good.
