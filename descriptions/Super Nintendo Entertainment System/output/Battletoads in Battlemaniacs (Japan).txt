In this game of up to two players, you control Pimple or Rash. Both Battletoads have combos and moves to help them defeat their enemies. The artistic style is decidedly cartoony, with exaggerated weapons protruding from the 'Toads' limbs to deliver the coup de grce. Like the original version of Battletoads, this game is also known for its extreme difficulty, and is incredibly tough to finish, even for experienced gamers.
