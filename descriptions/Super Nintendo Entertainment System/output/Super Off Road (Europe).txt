Grab the wheel and hit the gas! For the first time ever, race up to 4 players simultaneously with Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off-Road. Based on the #1 arcade game, this all-out dirt-grinding race is now available for the NES. Watch out for the mud holes, jumps and other obstacles on the 8 different Stadium tracks. From match-offs to spin-outs, Super Off-Road is as close to genuine short-course racing as you can get!
