Kyyaku Megami Tensei: Megami Tensei I - II consists of Megami Tensei and Megami Tensei II being updated and ported to the Super Famicom. It was released only in Japan in 1995 after Shin Megami Tensei: if... and on the heels of Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis. However Atlus did not take too many liberties with the original gameplay. A few portions of the dungeons of the first game were redone, along with a new save game and teleportation terminal feature which previously did not exist. The graphics and music were enhanced to match the capabilities of the Super Famicom.
