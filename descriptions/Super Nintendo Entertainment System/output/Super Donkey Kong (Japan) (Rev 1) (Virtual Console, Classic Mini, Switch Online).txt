Donkey Kong Country is a Jump & Run released in 1994 for the SNES. Challenged by the crazed tribe of reptilian Kremlings & King K. Rool, Donkey & Diddy Kong face their cunning adversaries armed with lightning-quick moves, chest-pounding muscle, and awesome aerial acrobatics. The duo also gets help from a host of friends and family - from Funky Kong, Cranky Kong and Candy Kong, to Rambi the rhino, Expresso the ostrich, Enguarde the swordfish, Squawks the parrot and Winky the frog. Explore over 30 levels plus dozens of hidden caves or secret rooms and discover every corner of the maps to help the Kongs recovering their stolen banana hoard!
