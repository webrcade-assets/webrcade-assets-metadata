Another in the series of Midway's retro arcade compilations, this is the first to feature early Atari titles (in addition to the usual FMV interview segments.)

The games included are:

Asteroids (vector space shooter)
Battlezone (vector 3D tank shooter)
Centipede (insect shooter)
Missile Command (missile shooter)
Super Breakout (the more varied sequel to Breakout, and the only non-shooter in this collection)
Tempest (color vector shooter)
