An updated version of Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter which adds a choice of turbo speed levels to increase the speed of the combat.

In the Story mode, the main storyline involves a demon named Dargon who has been revived with the sole intent to destroy the Flying Warriors, who are a team of superheroes. Dargon sent in his Tusk Soldiers to raid Shorinji and they ended up stealing the secret scroll of Hiryu-no-ken and a sacred sword. They also offer a challenge to anyone who wants to reclaim these artifacts, that they would have to have a showdown at the World Tournament. It is now up to Rick to enter this fighting tournament and win back these priceless artifacts.

During story mode, players control Rick in a side scrolling beat 'em up. Occasionally one one one boss battles will occur. Players will also be able to find healing items called miracle water which will restore depleted health.
