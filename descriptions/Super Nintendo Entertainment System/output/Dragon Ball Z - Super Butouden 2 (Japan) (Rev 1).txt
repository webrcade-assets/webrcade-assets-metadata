Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 2 (Z 2 Doragon Bru Zetto Sp Butden Ts?, Dragon Ball Z: Super Fighting Story 2), called Dragon Ball Z: la Lgende Saien in France and Dragon Ball Z: La Leyenda de Saien in Spain, is the second installment in the Super Butden series. The game was released in Japan on December 17, 1993 and in France and Spain in 1994. Super Butden 2 features 10 playable characters (8 normal, 2 unlockable with a code) and its story mode covers the Cell Games, as well as several stories involving Bojack, Zangya, and Broly completely unrelated to the movies they hail from. For unknown reasons, these three characters were renamed Kujila, Aki, and Tara in the French version, respectively.

Depending on if the player wins or loses a battle, the story will take a different turn in the Story Mode, which leads to a lot of possibilities to experience.

This is the only Dragon Ball Z fighting game in which Goku is not readily playable. A code is required in the Japanese version to unlock him and Broly, the other hidden character. This is not necessary in the European versions, as both characters are already unlocked.
