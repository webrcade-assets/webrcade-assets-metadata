Pilotwings is a flight simulator game that has the player attempt to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, use of a rocketbelt, hang gliding, and skydiving. Added to these are levels involving an attack helicopter and bonus stages. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of its flight simulation, the game extensively utilizes the SNES's Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotation and scaling of flat objects.
