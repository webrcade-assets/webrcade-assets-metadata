Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers is a head-to-head fighting game produced by Capcom originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1993. It is the fourth arcade version of Street Fighter II produced, following the original Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. In addition to refining and balancing the existing character roster from the previous installments, Super Street Fighter II also introduced four new characters. It was also the first game to be developed on Capcom's CP System II hardware, which permitted more sophisticated graphics and audio over the original CP System hardware, used by the previous versions of Street Fighter II.
