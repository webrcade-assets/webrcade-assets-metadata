Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."
