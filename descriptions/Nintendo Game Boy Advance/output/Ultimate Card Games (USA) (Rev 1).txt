Card gamecompilation pack from Telegames. There are nine classic card games: Hearts, Spades, Euchre, Canasta, Bridge, Cribbage, Go Fish, Gin Rummy, and Crazy Eights. There are also three casino-style games: Poker, Blackjack, and Video Poker. To cap things off, the development team included 15 different styles of solitaire games, including Klondike, FreeCell, Canfield, Pyramid, Golf, Spider, Baker's Dozen, Bristol, Castle, Aces Up, Barons, Eagle Wing, Eight Off, Calc, and Betsy Ross. If you don't know the rules to specific games, there's in-cartridge "how to play" tutorials that can be pulled up at any time. And, like Ultimate Brain Games, Ultimate Card Games features cartridge SRAM to save statistics and games in progress.
