It takes a driver with nerves of steel to take a high-powered racecar on the open road. Brave snowdrifts on ice-covered mountains, catch air off huge sand dunes in the desert, or careen around corners in the European countryside. Intensify the action by linking with 3 friends and going head-to-head in a 4-player race to the finish.
