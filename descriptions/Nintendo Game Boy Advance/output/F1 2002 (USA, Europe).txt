The gamealso features race incidents (crashes, withdrawals, engine breakdowns, real-time broken records), an audio engine simulating up to 4 engines at the same time (gears, power, Doppler effects), and two difficulty settings. Players can modify car assistance and other pilots' skills and speed and choose from four gamemodes: Race, Season 2002, Custom Championship and Multiplayer.
