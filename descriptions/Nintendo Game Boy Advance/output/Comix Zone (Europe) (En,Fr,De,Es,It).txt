Sketch Turner is just a struggling comic book artist, but his life is about to change dramatically. One day, while drawing his favorite villain Mortus, the two switch places, and Sketch finds himself immersed in the comic book world that he created! Now it's up to you to help the confused artist find and fight his way back to reality and a showdown with Mortus. The graphics which were drawn by real comic book artists give you the sense that you're actually "playing" a comic. As you fight the good fight, you'll see Mortus literally draw new enemies to take you down. If you're able to master some fighting moves and collect a few power-ups, you just might find yourself face-to-face with your own worst creation in the most important fight of your life!
