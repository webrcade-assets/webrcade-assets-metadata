Rayman 3 (gameBoy Advance) is a portable version of the console gameof the same name which was released for the gameBoy Advance in 2003. It is the first handheld Rayman gameto feature multiplayer modes which made use of the gameBoy Advance/GameCube link cable, to link to the GameCube version. It is a 2D side-scrolling gamewith elements from Rayman, Rayman 2, and Rayman 3, though it is mostly centered around the story of Rayman 2. It is thought that it was originally developed as a gameBoy Advance version of Rayman 2, and that its Rayman 3 elements were added late in its development so that it could be marketed as a gameBoy Advance version of Rayman 3.
