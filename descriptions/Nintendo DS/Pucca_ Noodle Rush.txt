Pucca Noodle Rush was inspired by time management mechanisms, along with many other ideas from the Pucca television series.You control Pucca, who is in charge of customer service in her uncle's restaurant. Seat customers, take their orders, serve them, clear the tables, pocket the cash, give priority service to your important friends, bring your impatient customers back to their tables and make sure that you seat your customers according to their respective affinities and rivalries... Pucca will be rushed off her feet!
