Tales to Enjoy! Little Red Riding Hood Review - Screenshot 1 of 2
Tales to Enjoy! Little Red Riding Hood is a collection of activities and games designed to be accessible to young children, ages 3-6 year old. With eight modes in all – which consist of puzzles, games of memory, a digital colouring book, and of course a re-telling of the classic fairy tale – there’s quite a healthy amount of content packed into this budget purchase. It’s just too bad niggling performance issues and questionable design choices complicate the experience.
