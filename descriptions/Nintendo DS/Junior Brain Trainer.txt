Give young brains a fitness workout with this fun and innovative DS brain training product, designed to improve reading, writing, spelling, maths, geometry, logic and problem-solving skills.

Created specifically for kids aged 6-11, Junior Brain Train takes a fresh and fun approach to learning by teaching kids in "bitesize' chunks and then rewarding them with unlockable mini-games. The program encourages children to spend a little time each day completing 5 different activities, with a rewarding game at the end.

Using a fun and stimulating environment it's the perfect way to keep them challenged and motivated so they're actually learning without realising it. A great way to support your child's classroom studies and build confidence at school!
