Have you ever dreamt about making and publishing your own digital games?

Publisher Dream is a simulation game that sees you as the owner of a company called Triangle. Triangle focuses on a digital platform called 'cShop' for development and publishing endeavours.

You can hire people to develop various game genres, and control the game budgets and quality to safeguard limited resources. Do you want to be one of the biggest publishers on cShop? This may be a great way to test your skills before actually starting your own game company!
