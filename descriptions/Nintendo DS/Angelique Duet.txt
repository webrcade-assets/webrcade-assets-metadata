Angelique Duet can be best described as romance simulation. It is a spin-off of the first Angelique game published 12 years earlier and one of the titles made to celebrate Koei's twentieth year anniversary. According to Ruby Party commentary, this title answered popular fan demand for an option to play as the first protagonist's rival, Rosalia.
