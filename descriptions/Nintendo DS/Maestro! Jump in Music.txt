Discover Presto, the music-loving bird, and make him evolve in a colorful, decibel-filled journey. Use the stylus to scrape, rub, tap and whirl to the rhythm of the level's music and like a good Maestro, stick to the original. Presto will jump or get off a platform in the order in which you strum the string, flying with his small wings to reach the music score.
