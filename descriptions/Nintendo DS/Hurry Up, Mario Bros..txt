Each level, except the tower, castle and 1-B, has 100 seconds. The player will be forced to the flagpole area after collecting a Star Coin. Players must finish “missions” to get a Star Coin. No checkpoints will be provided for every single level. Levels start off pretty hard. A partial custom world map is available.

This hack contains 1 world, 9 levels, and 27 Star Coins in total.
