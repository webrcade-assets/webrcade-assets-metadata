My Word Coach offers a fun and challenging way to improve verbal skills through a series of engaging activities and exercises. 

The game was inspired by ongoing vocabulary acquisition research by Thomas Cobb, Professor in Applied Linguistics at the University of Quebec.
When you play, My Word Coach assesses, monitors and rewards your Expression Potential, a percentage score that represents your ability to command and use the English language. The higher the number (out of a possible 100), the better you are able to express yourself! 

While the Nintendo Wii version takes advantage of the Nintendo Wii-mote’s possibilities through lively mini-games and easy-to-use controls, the Nintendo DS version makes full use of the system’s unique, dual touch screens.
