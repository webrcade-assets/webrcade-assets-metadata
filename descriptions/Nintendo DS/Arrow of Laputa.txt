"Arrow of Laputa" is a tower defense-type simulation game in which soldiers (units) such as swordsmen, archers, and sorcerers are placed in a floating fortress in the sky to protect the base from the approaching demon army. .

The main character, Luke (you), who was chosen as the "strategic commander" to lead the battle against the demon king's army on behalf of the heavenly world and the earthly world, is to stop the ambitions of the resurrected demon king. He travels around the world with him.
The monsters of the demon world will be attacked in various attractive stages with motifs such as old castles surrounded by forests, desert ruins, science cities and battleships.

Fortress Laputa is equipped with the ancient magic weapon that once buried the Demon King... the "Laputa Cannon". In the skies above the Demon King's army base, you will be performing a mission to charge this Laputa cannon with energy and shoot arrows of holy light at the enemy base.

The fate of the decisive battle with the Demon King's army is left to the command of the young commander.
