Peggle: Dual Shot is a Nintendo DS adaptation of the PC action puzzle game Peggle. Players shoot a ball to clear multi-colored pegs and bricks, score points and perform tricks and special moves for extra score. The game features ten Peggle "Masters", each showcasing a unique special power (multi-ball, flippers, guided balls, etc.) that players can activate and use in the various levels. The game draws inspiration from pinball, pachinko and Plinko.

In this DS-specific version, Peggle: Dual Shot features over 120 game boards (including all the levels from the original Peggle and its sequel Peggle Nights), along with 10 new levels designed by Q Entertainment. There is also a dual-screen "Bonus Underground" mode, where players can collect gems and power-ups that unlock the ten new levels. Other game modes are Challenge, with over 90 level-specific challenges to beat, and multiplayer (Duel mode).
