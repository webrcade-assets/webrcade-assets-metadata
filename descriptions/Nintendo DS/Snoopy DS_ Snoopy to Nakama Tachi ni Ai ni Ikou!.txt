Snoopy DS: Snoopy to Nakama Tachi ni Ai ni Ikou! is a game developed by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS and released in Japan on October 9, 2008. It was released by a new brand called "Pure Dreams" to target the casual, family oriented video game market.

The game consists of several minigames covering a variety of gameplay types, linked together by a world in which the player can talk to Peanuts characters and perform simple quests for them. The game was praised in previews for its adherence to the Peanuts art style, as well as for some of the minigames, but not for its connecting world.
