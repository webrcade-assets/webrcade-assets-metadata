This summer sports game features wooden characters called The Woodleys. You have to train yourself in eight different disciplines, ranging from hurdle race, discus throw, turtle gymnastics.

First off you have to create your own woodley, draw a t-shirt, choose colours, hair style etc. Then choose whether you want to train dome disciplines or enter a competition. 

During the racing discipline, you have to tip your touch pen onto two footprints on the touch screen alternately and as fast as you can to make your woodley run faster. In turtle gymnastics, you have to draw different symbols accurately to make your character doing gymnastic trainings on the back of a turtle.

Main goal of the game is to win in all disciplines to get the golden ash leaf award.
