SpongeBob SquarePants featuring Nicktoons: Globs of Doom (commonly shortened to simply Nicktoons: Globs of Doom) is a 2008 video game, the fourth and final installment in the Nicktoons Unite! series, and the last Nicktoons video game to be published by the original THQ company, before the company became defunct in 2013. Characters from SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, Tak and the Power of Juju, and Invader Zim appear. This is the only Nicktoons Unite! game to not feature characters from The Fairly OddParents. The original developers of the previous games for consoles did not come back to create this installment.
