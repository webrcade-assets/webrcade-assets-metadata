Treasure Masters Inc. is an adventure / puzzle game that is played entirely with the touch screen. The scenario leads us to search for an ancient artifact, of which Gordon Jones and his grandfather do not know the exact position. It will therefore be necessary to conduct the survey around the world, while monitoring other treasure hunters. As is often the case now, this title is not strictly a point'n-click adventure game, but rather a hidden object game. You will have to sift through each table in order to continue your investigation. The title embeds some mini-games of reflection, just to change the situations a little.
