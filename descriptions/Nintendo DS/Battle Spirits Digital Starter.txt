Unlike the two previous Battle Spirits games, this one is played exactly as the actual card game is. Retsu travels around a map and is given the option to either talk, battle, or trade with any person encountered. Each battle earns you Gala (the game's currency) and experience points to boost up your rank. With G, cards and accessories (such as different colored cores and sleeves) can be obtained at the Battle Spirits Center. Different locations will sell different sets. To purchase cards, you may choose to either buy booster packs or use a Carddass vending machine.

During the course of the main story, tournaments are held every sunday. There, you must win in a series of consecutive battles. Winning tournaments unlocks the next story chapter. There are also shop battles at the Battle Spirits Center, which are similar to tournaments, but require you to build a deck around a certain rule (i.e.: all yellow cards.)
