I want to change my mediocre self.
I'm interested in the world of racing, I have nothing to lose so I'll give it a try.

Wow! I got the job as an article writer!
It started from a chance encounter with one magazine, but I believe it was a chance given by god.

Now I'm headed to the Angstrom Racing Team's pit. It's the first time I've ever been at the circuit.
The hot sun, the glare of the concrete, the heat of the machinery, the spirit of the crowd. The rising shimmer of hot air, and the thunderous roar that seems like it could burst my eardrums.
The low hum that echos in the bottom of my stomach, the regular metallic ping that rumbles inside my head. The strength of all this excess noise makes me want to reflexively plug my ears.

I summon up all the courage inside me, first of all I just have to take one step!
I believe if I can just go forward I can change myself.
Walking towards the pit with my own two feet, I say goodbye to that old self.
And so...

During a hot summer, I met the wonderful members of team Angstrom.
I was surrounded by these wonderful men.
And so, I fell in love.
