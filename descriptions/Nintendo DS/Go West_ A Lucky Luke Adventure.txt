Go West: A Lucky Luke Adventure is based on the animated movie of the same name and basically a mini game collection. The basic story is that the Daltons escape from the authorities, rob a few banks and hide in a settler's track to California. Of course Lucky Luke is already on their tail...

The game consists of 40 linearly arranged mini games which follow the movie story - in fact after every solved game the player can watch a short movie clip. Most mini games can be divided into three categories: movement (e.g. on a horse or in a plane) while dodging obstacles or drawing and rhythm games. There a also a few ones which don't fall into these categories, e.g. cooking. During these games the player alternately takes the role of all main characters. In comparison the the Windows and Wii version the mini games in the DS version are adjusted to the technical abilities of the platform and use the stylus. There is also a new mini game, a side-scrolling platformer.
