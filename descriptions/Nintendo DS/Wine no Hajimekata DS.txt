Wine no Hajimekata DS (Wine Basics DS) focuses on a virtual guide to learning about wine, aimed at beginners and enthusiasts in Japan. It presents lessons and tips on wine culture, created with help from Mercian, a Japanese wine company. There is no story or fictional setting; the focus is on real-world wine knowledge.

Players go through lessons and quizzes to learn wine basics, like tasting techniques, pairing wine with food, and understanding popular wine types. The game includes a digital wine guide with details on different wines. Players answer questions or complete tasks to test their knowledge, with progress tracked as they get better. The first 1,000 copies sold included a real bottle of Dourthe No. 1 wine, but this was a limited offer.
