The Day of Memories games are romantic love simulations starring SNK, ADK, and SNK Playmore characters that take place in a parallel world to their own. The year that most of these games takes place is 200X. Each character takes roles similar to their original counterpart though they have been adjusted slightly to better fit the genre. For example, Kula wearing a junior high school seifuku uniform and a Gothic Lolita style outfit, as well as her normal clothes; she's usually introduced as K's younger sister.

Days of Memories 3, the third compilation for the DS, includes an original drama CD, a new character named Athena Hatsushiro, and a bonus scenario after all stories in the game have been cleared.
