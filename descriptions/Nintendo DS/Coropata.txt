In this quirky Nintendo DS game players guide a blue haired girl to a goal. The catch is you can’t control Himawari and she instinctively interacts with objects like butterflies and banana peels in her path.
Coropata shares a lot in common with The Incredible Machine since players have to creatively place items to get Himawari safely to the goal. If you want to stop her from falling into a pit, you have to place logs and platforms. Some objects are already set like basketballs and fans. Himawari will automatically play with these, but what she does with them depends on her mood. If she’s in a good mood she may throw a baseball, hit a wall, and trigger a Rube Goldberg contraption. If she’s in a bad mood she might kick it into the colorful abyss. Managing Himawari’s mood is another gameplay element.
