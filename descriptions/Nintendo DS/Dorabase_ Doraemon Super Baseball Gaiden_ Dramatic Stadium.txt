Dorabase: Doraemon Super Baseball Gaiden: Dramatic Stadium is a baseball game based on the manga "Dorabase: Doraemon Super Baseball Gaiden," which ran from 2000 to 2011 in Monthly CoroCoro Comic. The game integrates characters from the "Doraemon" universe.

The game differentiates itself from other baseball games by allowing players to use various "Secret Gadgets" during matches, similar to those found in the original manga. These gadgets can influence the game in various ways, such as turning a potential home run into an out with the "Take-copter." Players can also use "Special Batting" and "Special Pitching" techniques by tracing lines with the stylus. The game includes a "Cup Tournament" mode where players compete in tournaments to win different cups and face off against strong opponents from the manga.
