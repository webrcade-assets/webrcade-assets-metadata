My First Bescherelle is an educational game for Nintendo DS aimed at first and third grade schoolchildren. The cartridge allows the child to discover the basics of the French language through many games. You learn writing, sounds, vocabulary, grammar and conjugation. The character Justine, like a teacher, guides the child, helps him to move forward and tells him when he has succeeded or not.
