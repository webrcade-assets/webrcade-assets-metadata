When a war is going on, blacksmiths are critical. In Iron Master: The Legendary Blacksmith, players take on the role of one of these blacksmiths.

The main focus of the game is forging. Forging equipment is done through a mini-game in a step by step process. Casting, chopping, cutting, tempering, stretching, hammering, and melting are involved in this complex process. The game has hundreds of arms (bows, knives, spears, clubs axes, etc.) and armors (helmets, jewelry, etc.) to create .

The other part of the game is the one that focuses on running a shop. Players have to manage their stock, price items correctly so they'll sell, filling out customer's orders, and dealing with haggling customers.
