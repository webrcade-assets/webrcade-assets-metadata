Imagine: Teacher casts you in the role of a young woman named April who's just been hired to replace the aging and retiring Mr. Coddleton at the local elementary school. And, as it turns out, you'll be the only teacher on staff there. It's a small school with only four students starting out, you see -- but if you do a good enough job with their educations, more children will be encouraged to enroll.

As you're the only teacher in attendance, it's up to you to handle every single subject. Math, reading, history, biology. They're all there. And teaching them all takes the form of touch screen mini-game designs. You schedule a week's worth of courses in advance, then progress from Monday to Friday taking things one class at a time.
