Tornado lets players join forces with Toki and the other members of the Cosmic Cleaners as they set out to restore all of Earth's buildings, vehicles, inhabitants and other obscure objects that have been stolen by the envious Prince using his mischievous "Black Hole Device." Using a combination of stylus and microphone activated controls, players will travel across Planet 69 as they level up and max out their "Tornado Machines" to literally uproot everything in their paths in effort to take back what Prince has wrongfully stolen and return it to Earth
