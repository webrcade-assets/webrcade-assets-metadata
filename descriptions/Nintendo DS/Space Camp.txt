Welcome to Space Camp, where you'll receive the training and tools to become an astronaut. Experience weightlessness in a training pool and develop your navigation skills in the training simulator. You'll need your newly acquired skills, because during a training session, you get rocketed to the moon! With your faithful robot sidekick ARP, you need to maneuver through a daring lunar journey, work on the half-completed Moon Base, scour the lunar surface for elements and secrets, and refuel your ship for the ride home. Get yourself back to a hero's welcome!
