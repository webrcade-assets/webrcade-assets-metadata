Deal or No Deal: The Official Nintendo DS Game is an adaptation of the UK version of the game show Deal or No Deal. It's not to be confused with the Deal or No Deal game published by Destination Software which is a different adaptation based on the US version of the show. In addition to the UK version, the are also localized versions based on the Australian, Dutch, French, German and Italian versions of the show. Each of these has graphics modified to resemble the look of each show but they have only minor differences in gameplay.

The game has three different game modes. There is the contestant mode which is just like the TV show with the player having to pick one of the 22 boxes in an attempt to get the one with the highest value. The second mode is played from the view of the banker where the player offers money to an AI-controlled contestant in exchange for the chosen box. Finally, there is a forfeit mode which is unlocked by building up earnings in the contestant and boxer modes.
