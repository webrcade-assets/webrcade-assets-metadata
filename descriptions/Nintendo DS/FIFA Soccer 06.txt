The Nintendo DS version of FIFA Soccer 06 gives players the same great football-playing experience as its home console cousins. This is the first entry in the system's FIFA football series.

The games allow FIFA players to select a number of international football teams within a number of licensed football leagues. The DS version's gameplay modes include Kick Off, Career, Challenges, Season and Tournament. Multiplayer mode (both Single Card and Multi Card) also allows several players to play FIFA football against each other.

The DS version also features My Club, which allows you to create your own national football team.
