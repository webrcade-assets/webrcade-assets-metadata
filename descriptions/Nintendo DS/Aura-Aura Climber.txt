Aura-Aura Climber is an arcade-style game where you control a star which has fallen from the sky. Your goal is to grab onto grapple points floating in the air, which lift you higher and higher. By pressing the A Button to grab at the peak of the jump, you'll gain a bit of extra height. You can also use the Control Pad to change direction as you climb upwards, allowing you to reach out-of-reach grapple points. Finally, you can drop from great heights to your advantage, as grappling as you fall past a grapple point will slingshot you back in the opposite direction. By mastering all of these techniques, you can quickly and skillfully navigate to the goal at the top of the level.
