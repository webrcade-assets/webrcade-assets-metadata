The Madden series is coming to a brand-new platform, complete with wireless gameplay, dual screens, and multiple gameplay modes. In the DS version of Madden NFL 2005, you can use the touch screen to select plays, call audibles, and manipulate the kicking meter. The DS's lower screen shows you where all 22 players are on the field. In addition to a wireless multiplayer mode, the game features a season mode, a situation mode, and a two-minute drill mode.
