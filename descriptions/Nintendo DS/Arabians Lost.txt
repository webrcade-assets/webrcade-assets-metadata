Aileen Olazabal is the only daughter and princess of Gilkhatar who wants nothing more than to lead a normal life and not be a princess. However, nearing her birthday, the King and Queen decided that she should marry and chose a husband for her.

Wanting to live a normal life (which includes having a normal romance, falling in love, etc.), Aileen refused. This lead to a wager between Aileen and her parents; if Aileen could raise 10,000,000G in twenty five days, she's free to do what she wanted. If she failed, then she'd have to do what her parents had planned.
