Goony is a one-button arcade game for casual and core gamers. You control Goony, a jelly-like creature, who is running down a road covered in hazardous obstacles. The goal of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible. If you fall off the road or fall from a high place, you lose the game.

Goony is constantly on the go, and moves either left or right. You can switch the direction by simply pressing the +Control Pad.

Special blocks, which can help you, are scattered across the playfield. The playfield is infinitely long and lasts until you make a mistake. The number of steps you took is your final score.
