This game faithfully reproduces two japanese slot machines, "Blue Don Fireworks Pole" and "Blue Don Fireworks Master". The game features multiple modes; "Classic Mode" lets you play them as-is, "Dong-chan Mode" adds a variety of scenes and plot elements, simulation mode adds certain strategic functions and finally the mission mode is a sort of a versus game.
