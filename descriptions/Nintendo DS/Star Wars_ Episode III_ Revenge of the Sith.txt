The singleplayer mode is a side-scroller with a depth of field, which give a new dimension to explore while not in 3D. As you progress in the levels, the player can pick Mission Points that will help him to customize his character. It is actually the GBA version of the game but you can make the specials moves of the characters by pressing them on the touch screen. There is also 3 3D levels in each path that has been added to enhance the singleplayer experience.
