Anno 1701: Dawn of Discovery is a real-time strategy video game and makes extensive use of the system's touch-screen capabilities. There are three game mode options, consisting of a story mode, continuous play, and multiplayer. 
The player begins with a ship stocked with the necessary items to start a settlement. He is able to order it to explore until he finds an island that is suitable for settling and building a new colony. If the settlers are satisfied with everything they need, they will go up to the next stage. As they move through each stage, they will demand more things. In continuous play mode the player can choose up to three rivals, which will advance about the same rate as the player. As the settlers advance through each stage of settlement, the player can build warships and send to possessed island and build beachheads and then attack military buildings. If the player captures all of them, the island is his. The story mode is similar, but you need to fulfill certain tasks to proceed.
