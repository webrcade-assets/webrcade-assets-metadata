Design, train, and care for your dream horse. As reward for your hard work on the ranch, your grandfather has given you a horse of your own. Your new friend needs to be fed, trained, and most importantly, loved. Take your companion for long rides through the countryside surrounding the ranch, practice dressage and show jumping at the training center, then visit the local shops to buy riding gear and treats for your horse. When you're ready, compete with your fellow riders at the competition center.
