Jump into the suits of either Iron Man or War Machine in this sidescrolling action game that emphasizes aerial maneuverability and firepower. Each character controls differently and has a different role to play in the game, with War Machine able to use the touchscreen to blast foes from every angle, and Iron Man able to nimbly outmaneuver foes and use numerous weapon systems against mechanized opponents.

The game features a new story, separate from the events of the film, that pits Iron Man and War Machine against classic Marvel villains, such as Crimson Dynamo and Mandroid. The game also features numerous unlockable costumes and suits spanning decades of comic history.
