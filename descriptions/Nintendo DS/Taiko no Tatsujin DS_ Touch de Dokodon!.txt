Taiko no Tatsujin - Touch de Dokodon!" is the first, but not lst, DS game released for the arcade game series Taiko no Tatsujin. Highly addictive and fun to play, Taiko no Tatsujin offers a variety of songs from a variety of genres - classical, anime, J-Pop, game, Kids' songs, and Namco original music- for you to choose and unlock. This is a rhythm game, and despite its cute appearance it has a challenging side to it. With four modes of difficulty to choose from, you can spend hours playing this game. It is suitable for all ages and expertise, so playing with the whole family is also enoyable. To add to all the fun, you can even dress up the Taiko mascot, Wada Don. You can unlock outfits for Don to wear, and even unlock different instruments to play with if you tire of the default taiko drum.
