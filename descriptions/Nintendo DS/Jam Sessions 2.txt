Jam Sessions 2 is a guitar-game that makes learning to play the electric guitar fun and rewarding. Each song in the gameplay mode serves a different role in advancing playersâ€™ guitar skills and song writing abilities. By progressing through the songbook, players learn the guitar without realizing they have been taught. Armed with their new skills, they can play songs and share their own original music with others.
