At the beginning of the game, the player's submarine crashes in the Deep Sea. While the friendly sea serpent Jean Claude helps repair the submarine, the player must collect oxygen tanks by exploring the Deep Sea and completing activities. The oxygen chamber must reach its maximum level before the player can escape the Deep Sea.

As the player explores the Deep Sea, they must avoid pesky sea creatures. The player's health is represented by three hearts. Getting hurt by a sea creature costs the player one of their hearts. The player can jump on a sea creature to defeat it.

There are four activities, and each activity has three difficulty modes: easy, medium, and hard. There are 15 levels for each mode of difficulty. Unlocking all the levels in easy mode unlocks the first few levels in medium mode, and unlocking all the levels in medium mode unlocks the first few levels in hard mode. The player receives one oxygen tank for each level that they complete.

The player can collect a total of 21 trophies for completing activities and tasks.

The player also has an avatar that they can customize and buy clothes and accessories for at the Shop. The player can unlock new Shop items by collecting oxygen tanks.
