Moon places gamers on the cold lunar surface in the year 2058. Researchers are shocked to find a sealed, alien hatch during construction of a new lunar base, but it's a shock that soon pales in comparison to what they find beyond the hatch.

You are Major Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra Terrestrial Encounter Organization, and you and your team have been brought in to investigate. Erratic energy readings from deep below the lunar surface tell you that this will not be a diplomatic mission. As soon as you step onto the surface, you become enveloped in a game that delivers epic story, atmospheric environments and white-knuckle sci-fi FPS action. Welcome to the Moon.
