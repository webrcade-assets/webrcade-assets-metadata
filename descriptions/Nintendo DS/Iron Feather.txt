A top-down action/RPG game based on a Japanese manga by Kid, where the three characters battle all together on the screen through a vast landscape filled with enemies. Every 2000 years, a great disaster called the "Great Catastrophy" strikes the world. To protect the world from the latest incarnation, a young boy takes his special Iron Feather in hand and heads off on adventure. The game has encounter-based battles which give players the control of the main character while the computer controls party members. When moving around on the map, the bottom screen shows the action with the top screen used to show a to view of the surroundings.
