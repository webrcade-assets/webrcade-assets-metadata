Smart Girl's Playhouse 2 comes in two different versions: Boy and Girl. Alongside 13 fresh mini-games, each version includes five exclusive games that will specifically appeal to either gender. So, girls will be counting flowers, while boys get to grips with speeding motor cars. Both versions will help pre-school children to develop vital skills, including counting and reading, thanks to fun bursts of gameplay featuring charming characters and colourful graphics.
