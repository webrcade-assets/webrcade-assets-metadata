The Nintendo DS version of Tangled (based on the 2010 Walt Disney Animated Classic film of the same name) plays similarly to its home console cousins, except that the gameplay's side-view appears 2D rather than the 3D experience of the console versions.

The gameplay consists of helping Rapunzel completing several tasks for many characters from the film, primarily by using the Nintendo DS stylus to collect certain objects as well as tapping these characters to talk with them. Unlike the home console versions, a book found on Rapunzel's bed allows players to replay any chapter they want rather than a world map. Players also need to utilise the stylus to collect sun drops (in which collecting a certain number of them may come in handy if the player is stuck).

The DS microphone is also utilised to clear several objects out of the way (sensitivity can be adjusted any time in the Options menu).

Several minigames include colouring in pictures, petting several animal friends and even memory challenges.
