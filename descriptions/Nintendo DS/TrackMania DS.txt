TrackMania, the series of racing games focusing on fun and frantic racing, now makes its debut on the Nintendo DS. Far from hardcore driving simulations, TrackMania is based on the fun and the spectacular aspect of racing. With TrackMania DS, you drive at mind-blowing speeds on incredible tracks made of jumps, loops, turbo boost pads and many other crazy design elements. Just like the renowned PC version, TrackMania DS offers a track editor that lets you create your own unique and exciting tracks from hundreds of different design blocks, giving the game near-infinite replay value.
