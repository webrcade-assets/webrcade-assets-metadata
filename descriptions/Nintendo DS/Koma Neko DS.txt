Hello Kitty? No. Domokun? Fuggedaboutit. The new day is all about Koma-Neko which is a brown cat who sews, takes photographs, and creates stop-motion movies. The kitty-cat's creator is Tsuneo Goda who won an award at a French film festival for his work on the Koma Neko short film. Since that time, Koma-Neko has been making the merchandising rounds and this summer, her new Nintendo DS game reaches market. Players get to engage in mini-games that involve Koma-Neko's vices and vocations.

   The game world in which Koma Neko roams is made up of detailed interiors with modern amenities and lush outdoors filled with greenery. Koma's friends also abound and they may be greeted by touch pen tapping where they'll reciprocate in kind with a tip of the hat or a wave of the paw.
