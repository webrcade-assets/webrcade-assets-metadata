You play as a cute Koala named Ace who loves fruit! Unfortunately, a few delicious pieces of fruit are just out of reach and you need to change the positions of platforms to get to the fruit! You can change the positions of each platform by entering a mathematical formula. There’s no right or wrong answer, and every formula the player comes up with will have an effect on the world!
