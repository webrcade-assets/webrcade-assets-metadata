Control two characters at the same time and use two screens together to help piece a world split in half back together. Players take control of Kirra, the game's heroine, who is tasked with retrieving a mirror. When the mirror is accidentally broken, Kirra and her surroundings are split into two. To restore the world to normal, players must navigate between two screens to find the mirror's shards.

There are two primary mechanics in the game: the Reflection Mechanic and Shadow Mechanic. In both players control two characters, one on each screen, at the same time. With the Reflection mechanic, the two characters remain synchronized: objects affecting a character on one screen will affect the character on the second screen. With the Shadow Mechanic, characters are able to desynchronize from each other.
