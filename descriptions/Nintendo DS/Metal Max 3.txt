Metal Max 3 is a vehicle combat RPG. Similar with its predecessors, the game is open-ended and non-linear, with the player given the freedom to decide where to go and what missions to do in whichever order. The battles are turn-based, with the characters able to fight either on foot or using tanks. The tanks can be created and customized by the player, who can modify and enhance each part of a vehicle.
