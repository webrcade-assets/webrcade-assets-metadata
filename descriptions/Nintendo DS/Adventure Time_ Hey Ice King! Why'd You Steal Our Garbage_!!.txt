This is the first video game based on the radical, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network show about Jake, a wise dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything to become a great hero.

Adventure Time show creator Pendleton Ward is heavily involved with the game creation, including the design of a brand new storyline and concept. Set out on a heroic quest in a unique action adventure experience!

Journey through the Land of Ooo in an offbeat adventure to discover perilous dungeons, unimaginable treasures, the true meaning of friendship, and never-ending fun!
