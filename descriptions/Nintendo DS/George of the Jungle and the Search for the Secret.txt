George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret is a video game based on the animated television program George of the Jungle. The game is in 3D but plays like a 2D side scrolling platformer game with 3D turns and camera angles in the environment and the path that George walks on. There are a total of 6 levels; 2 with a jungle theme, 2 with a swamp theme, and 2 with temple theme. All 6 levels are made to look like the cartoon series (the 2007 remake, not the original 1960s version). Not once in the game do they specify what the secret actually is.
