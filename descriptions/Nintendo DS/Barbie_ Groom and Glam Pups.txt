Barbie Groom and Glam Pups is an all-new Barbie video game, set in a fashion-oriented environment, that lets players choose a pup from one of six adorable breeds, then groom it, train it, dress it up and show it using the game's built-in economy. Throughout the game, Barbie herself serves as a mentor for players, providing instruction and tips. Players will groom their pet with realistic techniques including bathing and brushing before teaching the pup fun tricks like jump, kiss and spin. Players can also customize the look of their dog with fabulous clothing, collars and costumes.
