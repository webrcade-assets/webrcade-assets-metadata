Shaun White Snowboarding is a sports video game for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Xbox 360 systems. It was developed by Ubisoft Montreal, published by Ubisoft, and released in 2008. The Wii edition of the game, Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip, was developed from the ground up for the system, taking full advantage of the Wii Balance Board accessory and featuring its own unique storyline and adventure with Shaun White.
There are six mountains in Shaun White Snowboarding, including Alaska, Park City, Europe and Japan. Each mountain features up to three different sections: peak, back country and park (or resort). There is also a "Target Limited Edition" of the game that's exclusive to the retailer; this version gives the player access to Target Mountain, an exclusive mountain with Target branding all over it, which has been described in-game as extremely difficult to find, and contains additional jibs, character models, and a sponsored version of the standard game's best snowboard which can be unlocked before the player's final challenge against Shaun White. The last mountain is set in British Columbia and is called B.C. The mountain is only available in the "Mile-High Pack" paid downloadable content. While players progress through the game, they will earn abilities that will help them throughout the game. Some of the abilities consist of gaining high speeds or the ability to break through obstacles to progress further in the game.
