This enhanced port of Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon features longtime Final Fantasy character Cid as a companion and a new story focused on him. It also includes new jobs for the player character. This version was later used as the base for the updated rerelease Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon: Every Buddy!
