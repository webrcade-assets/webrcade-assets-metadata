Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition focuses on a virtual version of the famous TV game show where players aim to win a million dollars by answering trivia questions.

Players answer multiple-choice trivia questions that get harder as they move up a money ladder, aiming for a virtual million-dollar prize. The game offers three lifelines—50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone a Friend—to help with tough questions. It includes a practice mode for trying questions without pressure and a “Fastest Finger First” mini-game to pick the starting player. 

Compared to the first edition, this version adds new questions, a fresh look with host animations, and voice clips. Players use buttons or the touch screen to pick answers, with progress saved as they climb the ladder.
