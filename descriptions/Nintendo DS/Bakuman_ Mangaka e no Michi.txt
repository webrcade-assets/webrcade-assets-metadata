The gameplay in Bakuman: Mangaka e no Michi is broken up into distinct segments that are based on each of the main characters' specialties. During the segments that focus on Moritaka, for example, players are tasked with performing activities based on actual manga artists' work, which includes things such as tracing over rough drafts and laying the aesthetic foundation for what the final product will look like. Akito's portions, on the other hand, consist of things related to his life as the writer in the duo. As such, the players' responsibility when following him is to assist him in creating dialog and plot beats, the actual mechanics of which can take the form of puzzles.
