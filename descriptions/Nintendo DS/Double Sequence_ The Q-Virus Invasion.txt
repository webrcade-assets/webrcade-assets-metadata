A stream of deadly Q-Viruses is taking over the universe by exterminating any sign of life that gets in the way! There's only one way to save civilization-crack the Q-Virus' DNA Code and obliterate them all. In "Double Sequence," players shift and slide blocks of the random genetic code in order to match like colors. This will not be easy-the patterns become more difficult as the Q-Virus ravaged more planets.
