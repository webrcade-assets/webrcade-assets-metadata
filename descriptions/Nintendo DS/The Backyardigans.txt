The Backyardigans is an educational game ported to Nintendo DS based on the Nickelodeon's 3D animated series created by Janice Burgess.

The gameplay consists in three game modes, like Adventure so the childrens can test the skills, Play any game so you can play just for fun and Remixes so you can play random mini-games. Each mode has three mini-games (with the 5 animal protagonists: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha and Austin.) such as Pirates ; Super heroes & super villains, Space garbage and free band play; These modes can make the children learn shapes, colors, numbers, rhythms, orders, you can use the touch screen to draw and follow the shapes and you can use the microphone to speak.
