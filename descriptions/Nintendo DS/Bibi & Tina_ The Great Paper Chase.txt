Bibi and Tina are best friends and Bibi spends almost every holiday on the ranch of Tina's mother. There, the girls experience exciting adventures, help out on the farm and feed for example the horses. This time, Tina's brother Holger has come up with something special for Bibi and Tina: he has organized a scavenger hunt. Of course on horseback - and so it is not only with skill to solve the tasks at the individual stations but also to take care of the needs of the horses.
