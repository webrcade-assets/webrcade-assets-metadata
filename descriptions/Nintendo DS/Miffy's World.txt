Miffy's World is a simulation game world targeting pre-teen children which features the rabbit Miffy and her cast of animal friends. The game wholeheartedly embraces the philosophy of Miffy's creator Dick Bruna in that it facilitates and enhances creative play. The simple quests and puzzles are designed to develop numeracy, cognitive and memory skills, as well as encouraging children to explore the world and interact with its array of colourful characters. With a clear understanding of its target audience, Miffy's World will also be unplayable during night time; by default the game is playable from 6am to 9pm, although this time is customizable by parents.

The star of approximately 120 books having sold in excess of 85 million copies worldwide, Miffy was first published in 1955 and is beloved by generations of children and adults across the globe. Adhering to a clear philosophy of respecting the world of the child, there are several guiding principles for everything that Miffy appears in, be it books, merchandise or television programmes; reliable quality, timelessness and no controversy. Miffy and her friends encourage children to express what they see, hear, feel and experience, but above all to allow scope for the child's own imagination.
