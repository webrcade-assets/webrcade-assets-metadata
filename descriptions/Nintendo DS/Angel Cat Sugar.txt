Angel Cat Sugar is a single-player, keyboard-controlled platform game that was released on multiple platforms. It is based on the character created by Yuko Shimizu. The story behind this game is as follows. There is an Angel Cat called Sugar. She was having tea and cake on a cloud one day with her three mouse friends when the Storm King came along and blew them away, scattering them to different parts of Angel Land. Sugar must travel throughout the land to find them. As she comes across others who have been inconvenienced by the Storm King she helps them, usually by retrieving objects that have been blown away. At the end of the game Angel Sugar confronts the Storm King showing him the consequences of his actions.

By helping others and retrieving objects Angel Cat unlocks handbag items, mini games and pictures that can be printed and coloured in off-line. In this game players do not create a player id when they play the game, there are ten pre-set player profiles each identified by a different picture that are ready to use. The game can be played in three difficulty settings. Along with the game there is an optional Angel Cat Sugar desktop theme which can either be installed with the game or later on.
