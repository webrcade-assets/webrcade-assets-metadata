Petz: Dogz 2 is a game for the Nintendo DS and PC. In the game, you can choose from lots of puppy breeds and play with them, pet them and play minigames.

You can also get accessories from different shops in the town which you can win by playing the minigames. There is a variety of games to play and higher quality items mean harder levels!

The dogs in this game don't have names, in fact your dog will just be called a shortening of its breed name (e.g. "Lab"). You live in a large house, but to start with you can only play in the Lounge and Garden. Other puppies will come to play too and you can have a great time with lots of puppy pals!

You can teach your dogs 14 different voice commands so they can let you know what they want.
