With an all new story and cast, an expanded roster of demons to manage, vastly expanded party interaction, an all new soundtrack from composer Kenji Ito, plus a host of refinements and improvements over its predecessor, Devil Survivor 2 delivers everything fans loved about the first game: an intense narrative with multiple endings based on player actions, the beautiful visuals and sounds the SMT series is renowned for, the addicting challenge of collecting, customizing, auctioning, and fusing every last demon in the game, and much more.
