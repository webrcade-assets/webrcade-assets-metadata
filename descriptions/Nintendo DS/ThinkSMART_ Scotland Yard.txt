Gamers head through five of the world's biggest cities as either a detective or as international criminal Mr. X in Scotland Yard. Adapted from the best-selling "Scotland Yard" board game, Mr X uses three different forms of transportation (bus, subway, or taxi) to move around each city, leaving behind only transportation tickets as clues to where he's headed.

Players must use observation, skill, and luck to surround the criminal, but if he escapes, the game is over. Gamers travel around maps of Amsterdam, Berlin, London, New York, and Paris, playing as Mr. X or the detective, and Scotland Yard also includes a variety of multiplayer modes, including a special handwriting feature for detectives.
