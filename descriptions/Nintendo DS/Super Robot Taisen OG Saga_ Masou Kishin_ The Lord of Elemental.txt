This is an updated remake of the original Masou Kishin The Lord of Elemental, originally released for the Super Famicom/SNES.

The game is pretty much the same as the original, except that now the game follows the story continuity of the OG (Original Generation) series by Banpresto. The graphics have been greatly improved and the battle sequences are stylized differently, to bring the series on the same level as the modern Super Robot Wars/Taisen titles.
