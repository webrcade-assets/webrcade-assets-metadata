This is the fans' chance to complete the circle. The legend of Final Fantasy III is reborn.

The Gulgan thus prophesied: This earthquake is only the beginning. The great tremors that swallowed the crystals, the light of our world, only to spawn monsters from the depths of the scarred land, are nothing but harbingers of what is yet to come. Something is coming...fathomless, ominous, and full of sorrow... But hope is not yet lost. Four souls will be blessed with the light, and so it shall begin... A chance encounter with a sentient crystal changes Lunethâ€™s life forever. Luneth must leave the peaceful village of Ur behind, and seek three others who share his destiny. Together, the four young adventurers set out on a dangerous journey to banish the darkness that threatens their world.
