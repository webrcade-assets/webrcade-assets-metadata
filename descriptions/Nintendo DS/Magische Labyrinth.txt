Plonk, ouch! The little magician rubs his eyes in amazement. Is there a wall? The sorcerers' apprentices are curiously exploring the magical labyrinth in search of the mysterious symbols. Tricky - because the big magicians play a trick on the little ones from time to time. As if by magic, paths remain closed and hidden corridors reveal themselves. Now it's time to use your brains - because you have to conquer the magical labyrinth and find the symbols.
