Based on the popular Harem anime To Love Ru Trouble, the game depicts the lives and comedic events of the hero Rito and the 11 girls he has to spend time with.

This time the To Love cast is stuck in a school located in the forest due a landslide that cuts them off from civilization, to keep them safe, the principal decided to let them live in the old mansion within the area.

As a lone teenage male, stuck in an enclosed area with 11 girls (aliens or not) can be heaven or hell, depending on the circumstances.

The main aim is to help the girls with their troubles. Of course you will be rewarded if you are successful. Besides the main storyline, the DS software is packed with mini games such as rhythm games, clothes changing (even cosplay as the plot progresses).
