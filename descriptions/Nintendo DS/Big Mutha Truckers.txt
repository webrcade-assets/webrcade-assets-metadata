Big Mutha Truckers, also known as Bakuso Convoy Densetsu: Otoko Hanamichi America Roman in Japan, is a 2002 racing video game developed by British studio Eutechnyx. Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of an eighteen wheeler. The game is available on Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance and PC, but enjoyed only mediocre critical and commercial success due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild" as its theme song. The sequel is Big Mutha Truckers 2.
