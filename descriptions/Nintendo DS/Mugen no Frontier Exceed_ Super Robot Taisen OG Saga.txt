Mugen no Frontier Exceed: Super Robot Taisen OG Saga is the sequel to Endless Frontier: Super Robot Wars OG Saga for the Nintendo DS, released in Japan on February 25. 2010. The cast from the original game returns in the sequel along with two new original characters to the series, Aledy Nashe and Neige Hausen. It also features Axel Almer and Einst Alchimie of Super Robot Wars A and Impact as playable characters, and Fighter Roar from SD The Great Battle and M.O.M.O. from the Xenosaga series as support characters.

The game retains the gameplay from its prequel, being a turn-based, console-style role-playing game with random encounters, boss battles, and exploration gameplay. The objective remains the same, using the characters' fighting skills to juggle the enemy in the air as long as possible. Successive juggling increases the chances of scoring critical hits, but if the enemy touches the ground during a combo animation, they may enact a "Forced Evasion," which will cause the reminding hits to miss and do no damage at all and end that character's phase of the turn while they have a chance to counter-attack the character. Combos can be strung together with a character's fighting skills, calling in the next character in line of that turn for Chain Attacks, and/or calling in a party in reserve for Support Attacks (which costs that character's SP), or the play can end the active character's phase into the next. And characters can use seishins before attacking their enemy.
