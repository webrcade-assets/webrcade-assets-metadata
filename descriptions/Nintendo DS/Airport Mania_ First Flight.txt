Airport Mania: First Flight is a time management game, that was jointly created by Reflexive Entertainment and South Wind Games. The player has to manage the wants of the planes as they come in for landings. The game shifts through eight different airports of play, and the levels have different challenges including a presidential plane (which has to land very quickly).
