Children with diabetes who struggle to find time to monitor their blood sugar levels, but do find time to play computer games for hours on end, could benefit from the latest innovation from Bayer.

The pharmaceutical manufacturer has teamed up with Nintendo to offer children “a fun solution” to blood sugar testing.

Bayer’s DIDGET glucose meter connects to the Nintendo DS and DS Lite games consoles. The meter is sold with a game called “Knock ‘Em Downs: World’s Fair”, which consists of several mini-arcade games and a larger “adventure game”.
