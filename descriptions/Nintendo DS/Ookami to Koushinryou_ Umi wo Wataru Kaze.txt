Spice and Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea (狼と香辛料 海を渡る風, Ōkami to Kōshinryō: Umi o Wataru Kaze) is a dating and business simulation game released in Japan on September 17, 2009. The game takes on and improves many elements from its predecessor, My Year With Holo, without being a direct sequel.

Players step into the shoes of series’ protagonist Kraft Lawrence on his adventures with Holo. While travelling north to find information about Holo’s hometown, the two are confronted by a massive channel of water which they cannot cross without passing through strict identity checks, impossible for the wolf-eared Holo to complete. Searching for alternative passage, they meet game-original character Luka (ルカ, Ruka), daughter of a ferryman who is currently missing.

Like the first game, gameplay consists of traveling through various locations, trading goods, and making the right choices in romantic events. There are also various new and improved mechanics, such as the inclusion of contracts with strict deadlines for deliveries and a grid-based inventory system. Also new is the inclusion of a third character to travel with, allowing players the opportunity to decide between deepening their relationship with Holo or another heroine of their choice. Possible companions include Norah, a shepherd; Eve, a merchant whose skills are said to outclass Lawrence’s; or new character Luka. Completing all four character routes on the same save slot unlocks the ‘Endless Mode’ which provides a new postgame quest with no time limit.
