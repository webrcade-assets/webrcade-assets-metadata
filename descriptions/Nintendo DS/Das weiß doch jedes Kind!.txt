The popular Sat 1 quiz show of the same name with presenter Cordula Stratmann is now available for the first time as a game for the DS console!

The gameplay is strongly based on the TV template and is based on the same rules as the show. The player has to answer questions from classes 1 to 5 (more than 2,000 questions from various subjects such as history, geography and mathematics are available) and can use an elementary school student as a 'joker'. An educational and fun game for all ages!

Adult candidates, who have finished school and are in the middle of life, are required to answer 10 questions from classes 1 to 5. The show will be moderated by comedy star Cordula Stratmann. That's why five students between the ages of ten and eleven help out each candidate as a joker. The adult can choose a student from among them, who then goes to a second desk and writes down his answers face down. If the candidate cannot answer the questions on their own, they can call on the help of their student godfather three times. The following joker options are open to him: 1. When 'cheating', he can see which answer the student has written down and then answer. 2. When 'copying', he adopts the child's solution. 3 In the 'last resort', the schoolchild can save him from being thrown out if he can correct the adult's wrong answer. When all jokers have been used up, the candidate must continue playing alone. If he answers all the questions correctly, he and the children can win the amount of money they have earned. But be careful, because every wrong answer can cost you all the money you have earned! In order to prevent such a bankruptcy, the candidate can give up, but must admit out loud: "Every child knows that, just not me."
