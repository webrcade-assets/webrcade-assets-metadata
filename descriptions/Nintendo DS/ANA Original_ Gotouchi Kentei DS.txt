ANA Original: Gotouchi Kentei DS quizzes you on the 47 prefectures of Japan. It contains ~5000 trivia questions covering cities, tourist attractions, specialty products exclusive to each prefecture and different dialects of the regions of Japan.. It basically tests "how Japanese you are" (that's what it says on the red band at the bottom of the packaging).
