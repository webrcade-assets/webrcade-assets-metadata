In the outskirts of the kingdom, there are rare crystals containing a secret magical energy inside them. Rumour has it that a sorcerer is collecting the crystals in a tower for some reason, but no one knows where or if the tower actually exists...

As the most famous bounty hunter in the kingdom, you've been hired to seek out and investigate the towerâ€™s location. At last you find the tower, but it has already been overrun by a large group of monsters intent on performing a dark ritual to summon a highly dangerous demon!

Although the demon has been summoned, you must stop the continuing ritual and kill the demon before it gains full power... or everything will be destroyed!
