High School Musical: Makin' the Cut! is a stylus and touch screen dance game based on the 2006 television movie High School Musical. You dance along with the movieâ€™s songs as Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Chad or Taylor. Circular icons appear on the screen that fill in with color, you tap with the stylus when they're full, matching the beat of the current song. In Dance mode you drag a basketball to an on-screen hoop or trace patterns in a notebook. You can also create and choreograph your own videos by changing camera angles and adding special effects in order to win the national title. You can then save the video and trade it with your friends (they must also own the game). The game also feature character customization.
