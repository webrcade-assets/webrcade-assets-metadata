Keroro Gunso the Super Movie: Gekishin Dragon Warriors de arimasu! is a single-player game for the Nintendo DS based on the fourth Keroro Gunso anime movie of the same name.

The game play is related to the fourth movie of the franchise. You basically fight your way through monsters and get the flag and put it in "checkpoints." When you put the flags in all the checkpoints in one level, you win, and you move on to the next level. You can collect models of characters from each level. It is necessary to collect all models to beat the whole game. You also have to play mini games that are based on older games (for example, Tamappy, based on Mappy) to beat the game as well.
