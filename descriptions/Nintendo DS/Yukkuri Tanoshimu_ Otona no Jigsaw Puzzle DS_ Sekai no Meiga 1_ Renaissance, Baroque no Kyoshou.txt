This Japanese-only release includes 102 jigsaw puzzles in the form of classical Renaissance art masterpieces, including the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, Raphael, Botticelli and much more.

The menus consist of Jigsaw Puzzle (ジグソーパズル, which allows players to select and play through all the various puzzles to solve), Challenge Mode, Gallery ( ギャラリー, which allows players to view the puzzles solved and more information about them) and Option (allows players to adjust the sound options, as well as the option to erase saved data).

Before starting the jigsaws, the player has the option to choose the number of pieces he/she wants, change the puzzle piece shape, change the background colour, choose whether to rotate the pieces or not and choose whether to include the completed photo of the selected artwork or not (which appears on the top screen).

In-game options include arranging the pieces, choose to solve the edge pieces (or フチ, fuchi) first or not, hide the on-screen menu and to quit the puzzle (there is also the option to save your progress upon quitting). For the rotating pieces option selected beforehand, a rotation icon appears on the corner of the Touch Screen.

The gameplay basically consists of using the Nintendo DS stylus to drag the pieces onto a square/rectangular board shown on the Touch Screen. Several puzzles in vertical portrait format require the player to turn the DS console sideways (an on-screen prompt appearing before each puzzle supports these). Upon completing the puzzle, it's then unlocked in the Gallery option in the Main Menu to view at any time.

The game also includes many classical music to keep in the game's Renaissance and artistic ambiance, such as Bach's 'Air' in the Gallery Menu.
