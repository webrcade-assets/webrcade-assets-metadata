Street Football mixes RPG-light with a Soccer Kid type platformer, sub-games and more traditional tournament fare. It's also based on a novel by Stefano Benni.
For most of Street Football you control Tag, the captain of Port Marie five-a-side team The Rifflers. The early sections of the game have you chasing from location to location to complete a range of sub-games â€“ the best of which sees you blowing into the microphone to ensure your goalie commands her area. Not all the fare is so inspired, however, and elsewhere there's a predictably large amount of frantic stylus rubbing to do.
