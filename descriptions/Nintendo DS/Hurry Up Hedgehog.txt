Hurry Up Hedgehog is not what you expect it to be when you hear the title. Naturally, you first think it’s a Sonic rip-off, given the “speediness” of the title. It’s easy to assume it might be some type of platform jumper, but that couldn’t be more wrong. It’s actually based on the German board game Igel Argern, which was released in the 1990s.

Not too many people have played Igel Argern (also known as Egelrace), mainly because it was (obviously) never released in the rest of the world. Plenty of board games are available for the DS platform, but most are popular titles like Scrabble or Monopoly. Hurry Up Hedgehog is somewhat of a backgammon meets checkers type thing, and will provide a different type of board game from what you are used to. Plus, it has a silly name that makes you want to give it a try. To that end, Oxygen Games gets a few points for originality in deciding to bring American audiences a German game instead of something we’ve seen a million times. The question is whether or not it holds its own as a standalone video game…
