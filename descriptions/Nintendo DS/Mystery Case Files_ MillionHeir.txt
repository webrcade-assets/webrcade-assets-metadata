Phil T. Rich has gone missing!

Players must find this missing millionaire by solving a series of touchscreen, hidden object puzzles on their Nintendo DS. With over a thousand items to find across 30 unique and cleverly-cluttered backgrounds, players must use all their observation and puzzle-solving skills to investigate the wacky suspects that may have been involved with Phil's disappearance.

Adding to the variety are several modes new to the Mystery Case Files franchise, including X-Ray Mode, Flashlight Mode, and touchscreen minigames, such fingerprint dusting, tile-sliding jigsaw puzzles, and DNA sequencing.

Mystery Case Files: MillionHeir also features a robust wireless multiplayer mode, where players can cooperate to solve the mystery or compete to find the most items in the least amount of time.
