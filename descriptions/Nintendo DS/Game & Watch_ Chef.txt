Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes. And no Game & Watch title would be complete without the ‘Watch’ function - each title includes a fully functional clock. In Chef, you are a cook, frantically flipping food with your frying pan for as long as you can. Watch out for the pesky cat, trying to put you off by grabbing your food with a fork. Game A features three tasty morsels to juggle, while Game B ups the challenge with four!
