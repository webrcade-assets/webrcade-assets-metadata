You play as Dougal but there's not really a story of any description, instead you are told by Zebedee to go and talk to your friends on the outskirts of the town. This involves you seeking out the likes of Dylan and Ermintrude who will then ask you to undertake a chore for them, which translates to a mini-game. Not all of these are fun and some are just plain nonsense but the game does have some gems too. The best is probably sending out invitations challenging you to trace a variety of shapes within a time limit. You'll even have the opportunity to use the microphone in an attempt to keep a paper plane in the air. There are around a dozen of these games scattered around and once you've played them you can replay them at any time from the village square. They actually do have a point; completing games rewards you with gold stars which, in turn, open up such bonus items as screens and (incredibly short) film clips.
