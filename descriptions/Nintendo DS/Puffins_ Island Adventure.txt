Puffins: Island Adventure begins by asking the player to choose their puffin eye type, beak colour and hairstyle. The game is a collection of minigames, unlocked as our puffin interacts through dialogue with the other members of the puffin flock in the island. Minigames include races reminiscent of Super Mario Kart, various kinds of fishing (pool tide, dive, and so forth), a diving contest, and others, for a total of 100 events. Photographs and videoclips are respectively unlocked by completing set of events, and purchased with capelin, the game's currency earned during minigames. The purpose of the game is to become the most popular puffin of the flock.
