Ubisoft's dim-witted, unhinged rabbits are back for more madcap mini-game merriment in Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party. Nintendo DS owners will partake in themed activities that poke fun at television, movies, and other aspects of pop culture. Over 45 games are included, each designed to take advantage of the stylus, microphone, or dual-screen display. A new board game mode has you guiding limbless mascot Rayman in a race to catch the Rabbids from each television channel. Challenge up to three friends via wireless connection, with a total of 15 activities available for single-card download play.
