Pile up blocks that fall from the sky until you reach the 'zone ceiling' target.

Once a block touches the ground or another block, it will stick and the next block will start to fall. If a block comes to rest in a position that isn't well-balanced, it could topple off. You can grab hold of falling blocks using the stylus and slide them around or rotate them by manipulating their centers of gravity. The key to building a good stack is landing blocks in a stable, well-balanced position.

Features

• Stack piles of colorful shapes without dropping them.
• Use realistic physics and gravity to keep the pieces from falling.
