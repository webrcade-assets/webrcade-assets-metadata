Joe, Beth and Frannie have a visit from snooty friend Connie. Connie won’t believe in the Faraway Tree and the magical people who live there – Moon-face, Silky the fairy and Saucepan Man. There’s only one way to prove her wrong – together the children climb the tree, and visit some of the lands at the top of it, like the Land of Secrets and the Land of Treats. And after a few adventures, Connie learns to be a nicer person altogether! Flips Interactive Books – the Fun New Way for Kids to Read.
