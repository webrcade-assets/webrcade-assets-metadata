Zubo is a music-based rhythm action game featuring a unique set of characters that is scheduled to ship worldwide later this year, exclusively on the Nintendo DS handheld system. Players enter the world of Zubalon to help the colorful and zany inhabitants, the Zubos, defeat an evil force, which is bent on world domination. Players can befriend the Zubos they meet along the way, feed and nurture them, help them gain skills and strength, and assist them in their battles with the enemy, the dastardly Zombos.
