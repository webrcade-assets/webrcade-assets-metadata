Clueless Fashion (also known as Clueless or Clueless: Girls in Beverly Hills) is an unreleased video game made for the Nintendo DS, intended to be a tie-in for the 1995 comedy film Clueless. The game was developed by Glyphic Entertainment and was set to be published by 505 Games. The game was possibly intended to be released in Europe on February 26th, 2010,[1] with no other planned releases being known (though the game is rated by the ESRB, meaning that a North American release was also likely intended).
