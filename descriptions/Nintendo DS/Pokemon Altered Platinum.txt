Introduction

Pokémon Altered Platinum is a Platinum hack which makes radical changes to the way the game works, for the sake of fun and a fresh Sinnoh experience.

Meet 30 new Sinnohan forms(not rushed, just been working on this thing for WAY too long), each with a unique design, type, stats and more!

Play with old Pokémon that have been changed so extensively that it's like they're brand-new, and get used to an overall higher standard of power where almost everything should be usable.

The Ice type has undergone some extensive changes, with its Rock weakness removed and new resistances to Water, Ground, and Dragon.

Face an increased challenge, that isn't quite Kaizo levels, but it's definitely tougher than base Renegade Platinum. With the removal of effort values, you're limited to roughly the same level of power as the NPC trainers(who also can't use EVs), and you don't have to EV grind for hours!

Gym Leaders are no longer limited to types! Instead, their teams are centered around a particular gimmick, such as Roark's Stealth Rock team.

Play around with some new moves with (sorta)custom animations, such as the low-power physical Fairy move Roughhouse, or the 100% accurate, 90 power, no effects physical Flying move Meteor Dive! Some are even signature moves, such as Skarmory's Steel Feathers or (SPOILER)'s Cosmic Void.

Find newly recolored shiny Pokémon, like an autumn-colored Leafeon, or cherry blossom Torterra, with Renegade's 1/512 shiny rate included!

Some NPC dialogue that didn't give lore or story has been replaced(not all of it yet). This includes new jokes and references, but also some extra lore for the new Sinnohan Forms, to help them truly feel at home in this brand-new Sinnoh! Each new form even includes new Pokédex entries!

On top of all of this, there's even a familiar face as a new postgame boss trainer, whom is equivalent to Renegade Platinum's Steven Stone battle. Check the Screenshots with spoilers for more info!
