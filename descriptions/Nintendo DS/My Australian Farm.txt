My Australian Farm is a breeding simulation game! At the beginning, all you own is an empty field, a little money and a single emu. You need to feed the emu and take care of it!

Well-fed with seed, it will lay eggs which can then be sold - with this money you can buy new animals at the Farmersâ€™ Market and purchase equipment from the Shopkeeper.

Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (a grain store, a wind turbine, a sacred stone, etc) and you will be able to exchange your animals with friends who play My Farm, My Exotic Farm, My Asian Farm or My Australian Farm!
