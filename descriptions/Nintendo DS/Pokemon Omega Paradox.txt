This is my first ever post on Pokecommunity so I hope I did this correctly...
In the past I hacked Pokemon Volt White just messing around editing overworld's and Gym Leaders but after a long time I decided to continue hacking and complete it. Before i planned on releasing this hack I ended up changing the trainers you train against into more important trainers more specifically Gym Leaders or now known as Former-Gym Leaders. Some trainers I replaced for looker,lance,etc. Now that I have explained why you see important characters everywhere throughout the game, I can explain the hack itself...
