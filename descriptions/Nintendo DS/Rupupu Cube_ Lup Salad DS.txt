Rupupu Cube: Lup Salad (often erroneously referred to as "Loopop Cube: Lup Salad" or "Loopop Cube: Loop Salad") is a puzzle-game where the goal is to, as the main character Salad, clear each level of all its coloured blocks. A block disappears when matched with two or more of the same colour. The game was originally released for the PlayStation in 1996, but has since been ported to the Nintendo DS (in 2008) as Rupupu Cube: Lup Salad DS, and the PlayStation Portable (in 2010) as Rupupu Cube: Lup Salad Portable Matatabi.
