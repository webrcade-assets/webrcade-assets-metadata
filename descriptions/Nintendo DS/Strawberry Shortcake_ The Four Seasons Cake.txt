Strawberry Shortcake, her friends and the pets Pupcake, Custard and Marmalade are getting ready to enjoy a fun afternoon of races, contests and, of course, dessert as they participate in the Nearly-Once-a-Yearly Strawberryland games! It would be a berry sweet event if not for the bragging Peppermint Fizz and her pet, Cola Chameleon. Peppermint wants to show off her pet Cola so much she's been cheating during the races and rigging the contests. The girls have decided to give her a lesson in humility by winning - fair and square…
