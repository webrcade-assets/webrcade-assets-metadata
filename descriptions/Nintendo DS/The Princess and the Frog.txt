On the Nintendo DS, players master the art of platforming as Tiana and Ray--jumping, swinging, and soaring their way past obstacles to advance through multiple levels and solve exciting environmental puzzles. Gameplay includes collecting ingredients and recipes, cooking dishes, and performing music with one to four players. Players can also collect real recipes and save music in the game's jukebox.
