During the game, the player visits five islands, one of them the same island that Sonny will one day wash up on. It reuses some of the locations and characters from So Blonde: Back to the Island but it is not necessary to have played any of those games to understand the story. Travelling on the islands is instant through clicking on locations on an interactive map, between the islands by clicking on the ship in the docks. Progress is made by talking to people, solving puzzles and playing mini-games. The latter are entirely optional. The Nintendo DS version has no voice-overs but is otherwise identical to the other versions.
