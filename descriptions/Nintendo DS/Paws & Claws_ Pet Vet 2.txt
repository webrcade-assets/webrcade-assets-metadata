An expanded remake of the first game, Healing Hands once again puts the player into the shoes of a new vet, just starting her practice. Owners will bring their pets in, with various diseases and conditions, and the player needs to diagnose and treat them. You can head into town to replace supplies used in treating your patients, or take care of shopping. Over time, you can buy new buildings for long term care, and take classes to expand the range of animals you can treat.

Healing Hands includes two new animal types, and enhanced touch-screen functionality.
