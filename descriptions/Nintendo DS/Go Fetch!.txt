Balls are thrown and players must use the stylus to guide the puppy and collect balls. The puppy must avoid various obstacles and collect items in order to complete stages. A wide variety of locations, including Backyard, Park, Beach, Riverside, School, Plaza and Parking Lot, offer various challenges. Choose from different breeds of puppies, each with its own unique appearance and attributes. Remember, puppies are easily distracted, so don’t get too close to a cat or you’ll lose valuable time. If the puppy knocks something down, time is lost since the item must be picked up. Fetch this game and enter the doggy dog world.
