The game follows the three main characters of the film — namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley — and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the gameplay in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games. In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards. The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.
