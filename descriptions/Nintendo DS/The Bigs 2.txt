The Bigs 2 is an arcade-oriented baseball game. The basic mechanics are similar to the other versions of this game. During matches, the player takes the role of the active player, e.g. the batter, and tries to make a successful move. Successful actions fill up a power meter and when it is full, the player can unleash powerful abilities: Big Blast (an automatic home run when hitting the ball as batter) or Big Heat (a power pitch). The controls and user interface are adapted to the Nintendo DS' technical prerequisites and make strong use of the touch screen and stylus. The only available playing modes are single matches, home run derby and home run pinball.
