Naruto ShippÅ«den: Naruto vs. Sasuke is the sixth instalment of the Ninja Council series.

It incorporates several tag-team specials. The character's sprites are smaller, allowing more action on-screen. Most of the special moves no longer use touch screen in order to be performed. Touch screen controls perform certain techniques. New characters include Sasuke and Sai. The on-line play has been removed, although there is a High Score mode available. There are also side-missions which can be completed to unlock more characters. Unlike the previous games, villains are not playable.
