HIGHLY RECOMMENDED rating: "Vocabulary trainers are now a well-established genre on the Nintendo DS and it should actually be difficult for any newcomer to establish themselves in the highly competitive market. But a simple, serious presentation, a thematic vocabulary training based on the European reference level and a concept based on the 'Travel Coach Europe', which has also been available for the Nintendo DS since the summer, make 'HMH Vocabulary Trainer English' the best virtual vocabulary trainer currently available grab."
