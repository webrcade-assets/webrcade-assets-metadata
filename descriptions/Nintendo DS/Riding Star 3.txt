Riding Star 3 is the Nintendo DS version of the third installment of a series of games simulating equitation. The previous titles (Riding Star and Riding Star 2) were only available for PC.

In the game the player may choose a character and a name as well as a horse. The horse has stats like stamina, jumping power and trust. These can and must be raised through practising in special training stages. When the horse's stats reach a certain level, higher and more challenging tournaments are unlocked. 

The tournaments consist of challenges in three modes: dressage, jumping and cross-country (a.k.a. military). These take place on various tournament grounds, both indoor and outdoor, including the world championship stadium in the German town of Aachen (home to the World Equestrian Games 2006).

In the stable area, the player may interact with his or her horse by using the stylus to groom and brush, feed the horse and clean its hooves. Spending time with the horse will increase its trust in the player character. 

The game allows the player to choose from 5 different languages (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish). A PS2 and PC Version of Riding Star 3 were also published.
