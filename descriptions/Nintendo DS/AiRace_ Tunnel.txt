AiRace: Tunnel invites you to take on the challenges of Project Tunnel - a recently developed project designed to test the skills and precision of aviation rookies. Think you've got the skills? Then put your reflexes to the test and see how swift you are, how exact you are and how well you anticipate the unexpected. Manoeuvre your aircraft safely through specially created winding tunnels full of traps. And be careful – your plane will speed up with every second making each turn and barrier harder to negotiate. It’s not just a game – it’s a challenge.
