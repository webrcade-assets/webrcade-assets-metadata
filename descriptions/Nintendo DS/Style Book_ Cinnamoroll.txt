Sanrio is a Japanese company known for creating and marketing a wide range of characters, with Hello Kitty being its most famous. "Style Book: Cinnamoroll" is about another character of theirs, Cinnamoroll. The game functions as an electronic diary where players can schedule events, set alarms, and collect "Smile Points." These points can be used to obtain various items such as colored pencils and stickers to personalize the diary entries.

Players can use the software to manage their daily schedules, with features allowing them to set reminders and alarms. As they interact with the game, they gather "Smile Points," which can be exchanged for decorative items to customize their virtual diary. The interface encourages creativity and organization, making it both a practical tool and a playful experience for fans of Cinnamoroll and Sanrio characters.
