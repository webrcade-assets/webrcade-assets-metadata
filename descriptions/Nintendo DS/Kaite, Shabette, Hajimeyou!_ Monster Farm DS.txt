Monster Farm DS, known as Kaite Shabette Hajimeyou!: Monster Farm DS in Japan, is a life simulation video game developed by Tecmo and published for the Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan in 2007 and had no further release in the United States, much to fans disappointment. There had been talk that it would be released under the name Monster Farm Jamboree, but now it is just referred to as Monster Farm DS.

On November 10, 2009, it was announced that the game's sequel would be released in North America as Monster Rancher DS while the first remained unlocalized.
The game involves raising, fighting, and breeding monsters. The main character is never seen on screen, but always talks to his apprentice, Cleo, directly. The player chooses his actions and choices through menu options.
