The gameplay revolves around playing virtual games of Top Trumps based on the National Basketball Association Top Trumps packs.

When a match starts, you and your opponent have to fight to gain control of the ball. This decides who takes their turn first. There are time limits to stop a player stalling when choosing their stats. Stats consist of height, free throw percentage, scoring average, assist average, rebound average and number of playoff games played. Every card you win against moves you closer to the basket until you shoot for it.
