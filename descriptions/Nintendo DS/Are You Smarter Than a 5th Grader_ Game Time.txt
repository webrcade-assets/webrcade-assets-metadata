Game Time is the follow-up to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Make the Grade and it is based on the concept of the TV show where contestants try to prove they are smarter than fifth graders. Players must answer a series of question and pick a 5th grade partner to fall back on when they need help. The questions are grouped in categories from first grade to fifth grade. Every question leading up to the final is multiple choice and there are also bonus questions and mini-games. The answer to the very last question always needs to be spelled out, making it a little more challenging.

Next to the main game modes, interspersed with dialogues between each question, there is the Homeroom challenge where the game can be played with a group. In Battle of Wits the questions are asked quickly in successions and players can earn bonuses to sabotage other players. In Three and Out players need to buzz in rapidly and after three incorrect answers the game is over.

The Xbox 360 version supports online multiplayer.
