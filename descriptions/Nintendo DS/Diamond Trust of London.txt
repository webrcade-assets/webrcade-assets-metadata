With the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme soon to go into effect in a few months, two competing diamond trading companies set out to make as much money as they can in Angola.

Players take on the role of either the owner of the Diamond Trust of London or a company located in Antwerp. The game consists of nine turns and the player who has the most diamonds at the end of those turns wins the game. To acquire the diamonds, players send their three diamond purchasing agents to one of the six locations in Angola Players have to attempt to outbid their competitor in how much they pay a local guide, but have to be careful in not overpaying as money is limited. An agent can then be called back home to deposit any diamonds they accrued.

The game also has an added layer of subterfuge. The opponent's agents can be bribed to reveal what they are up to and a UN inspector. who typically moves around randomly to break up any illegal diamond deals, can also be bribed to cause the opposing player trouble.
