Pac-Land has been attacked by the legendary ghost Golvis. With the help of a fairy, Pac-Man must save the world and free his friends. Using the touchscreen, players roll Pac-Man similarly to using a trackball. Guide him through 3D levels collecting pac-dots, avoiding ghosts or eating them with power pellets. There are 2 new power-ups - a feather hat which makes Pac-Man float and heavy armour which allows Pac-Man to go underwater.

As well as the story mode, each level can be played as in time attack and challenge modes. Challenges require the player to finish a level in a different way, such as avoiding all pac-dots.
