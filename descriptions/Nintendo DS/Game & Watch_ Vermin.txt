Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes. And no Game & Watch title would be complete without the ‘Watch’ function - each title includes a fully functional clock. In Vermin, take control of a gardener, protecting his plot from marauding moles. As the moles make their way towards you, move left and right to line yourself up to make a well-timed whack with your mallets and send the burrowers packing. In Game B, more moles will appear, making your life all the more harder!
