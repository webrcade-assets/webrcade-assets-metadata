An earthquake hits the museum, can you get out??
Escape the Museum is an extremely pleasant surprise, offering a whole host of conundrums to crack, plenty of objects to find, and extras to unlock during the journey. Not perfect, by any means, but definitely a breath of fresh air in a heavily populated genre.
