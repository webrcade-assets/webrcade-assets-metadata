Mawashite Tsunageru Touch Panic (roughly translated as Slide and Turn: Touch Panic) is a Nintendo DS video game released in 2006 by AKI Corporation (developer) and Nintendo (publisher) exclusively in Japan. The game is a variation of Pipe Dream, which much more depth.
In Touch Panic, you'll alter the positions of panels in order to get your Touch Balls or Panic Balls (referred to as both in English language references) around the stage and to the end. The game is completely touch screen driven.
