Even little princesses have to exchange the fairy wand for a pen and go to school. Luckily, Princess Lillifee and all her friends are helping preschoolers prepare for elementary school in a fun way. Learning numbers and letters, basic arithmetic and reading, even the first English terms are taught to the players in the most beautiful places in Princess Lillifee's palace garden. And practice pays off: the more the player gets right, the more levels and bonus games she unlocks.
