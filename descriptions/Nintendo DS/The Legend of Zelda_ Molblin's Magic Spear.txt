Molblin's Magic Spear is a children's book based on The Legend of Zelda, published by Nintendo. Its story takes place during the events of The Legend of Zelda, and is presented as a minor adventure that takes place during Link's quest to rescue Princess Zelda from Gannon. Some copies of the book came with a listen-along cassette.

As in the first two games in the series, the word is spelled "Molblin" rather than the officially accepted "Moblin".
