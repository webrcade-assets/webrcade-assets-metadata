Kira and L square off once again, but this time, via a game known as the 'Kira Game'. One player plays the role of Kira, another plays the role of L, and they race to determine who the victor will be! Kira's objective is to kill L, single him out, or convince everybody else to arrest him, but in the meantime, L is racing to discover and arrest Kira as quickly as possible. Build trust, raise suspicions, and determine who truly can be called justice!
