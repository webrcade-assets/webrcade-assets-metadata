The Nintendo DS version of "Catan" was developed in collaboration with Klaus Teuber. Besides the Base Game, it also contains scenarios from the Seafarers expansion (among others, Greater Catan) that provide additional adventures and challenges.

"Catan" offers a varied campaign with eight different computer opponents. Up to four players can compete with each other via the Nintendo WiFi connection. The comprehensive Catan almanac explains all terms and components of the Catan world. It tells you, for example, what the robber is about or how to use a Knight card.
