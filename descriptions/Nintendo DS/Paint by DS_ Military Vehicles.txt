Paint Military Vehicles DS. It was published by Ertain for NDS.
You don't control the tanks and planes in this game... you paint them! Using the stylus, add color to a pencil sketch on the bottom screen while viewing a final drawing on the top screen. Then choose from oil paints, colored pencils or water color to put in the final details.
