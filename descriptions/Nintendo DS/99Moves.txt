99Moves is a retro arcade game where you will have to survive with just 99 Movements.

With nowhere to head in the galaxy, all was lost as your energy was about to run out... gravity would chart the course of your destiny. Suddenly, V-99 has entered a zone which provides energy, called Shaders... a new opportunity to survive! However, it's not all good news, as you only have 99 energy pulses to move through the Shaders zone!
