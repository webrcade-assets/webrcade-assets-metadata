The name of the game translates as Hello Kitty's Smartly Dressed Party
The game has a detailed illustrated encyclopedia, which documents over 300 Sanrio characters and brands. The game also has a dress-up feature where players can dress-up Hello Kitty. The player can choose to buy new clothes and accessories using points.

Points can be earned by playing minigames, including "Sanrio Quiz" (Japanese: サンリオクイズ), "Memory Game" (Japanese: きおくりょくゲーム), "Calculation Game" (Japanese: けいさんゲーム), Spot the Difference (Japanese: まちがいさがし) and "Jigsaw Puzzle" (Japanese: ジグソーパズル). Each minigame can be played on an easy, medium, or hard difficulty. The amount of points that the player obtains may depend on the difficulty of the minigame (with a x2 multiplier for normal mode and a x3 multiplayer for hard mode) and the amount of correct answers given.

The game has a "fortune-telling" feature, where the player can pick a card and have the game tell a Sanrio character that will/has described their day, with a keyword and'key point' description. For example, the key-word for the Osaru no Monkichi card is "popular person" and suggests in the key point description that today the user will talk more than usual on the day they receive the card. The fortune-telling feature also suggests a lucky game. The player normally has to wait until the next to select a new card.

The game has a stamp feature where the player can mark each day they play the game with a stamp, such as a stamp of Hello Kitty or her ribbon, or a star, or a musical note or an apple. All stamps can be red, blue, green, pink or black.
