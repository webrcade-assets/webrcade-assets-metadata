Hands On! Tangrams allows the player to play the old Chinese Tangram puzzle game. Using seven geometrical shapes known as "tans," the player tries to fill in the outline of a shape in order to solve the puzzle and reveal the picture that the shape represents. Once a puzzle is solved and the picture is revealed, the image appears on the top screen, slowly completing an illustration. Each of the 10 levels of the game features a distinct theme such as "Zoo" or "Beach," with each theme containing 10 puzzles.
