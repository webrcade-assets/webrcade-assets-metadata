Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century is an action video game developed by Art Co., Ltd and Cartoon Network Interactive, and published by D3 Publisher and WB Games for the Nintendo DS handheld console. The game is based on the popular, long-running Cartoon Network animated television series, Ed, Edd n Eddy. It was released on October 23, 2007, in the United States. In the game, the Eds run the risk of having their scams turned on them by the other kids in the neighborhood. Many of the objects and characters, as well as the visual style, borrow heavily from the cartoon. This is also the last game for the series.
