My Exotic Farm is a breeding simulation game. At the beginning, all you own is an empty field, a few pennies and a single little parrot... You need to feed the parrot and take care of it! Then your parrot will make feathers which can be sold. And with this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmersâ€™ Market and purchase equipment from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (well, great green macaw, guard dog, 4x4, etc.). And you will be able to exchange your animals with your friends who play My Farm or My Exotic Farm!
