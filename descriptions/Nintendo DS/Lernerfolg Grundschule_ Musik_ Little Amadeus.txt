Simply brilliant: playing the piano with Little AmadeusDiscover the world of sheet music with little Mozart
In »Learning Success in Primary School Music - Little Amadeus«, the pupils are introduced to the world of music. They learn to read music, tap rhythms and recognize instruments in a playful way with the cartoon character Little Amadeus, known from the children's channel (KI.KA), and his friends. If you consistently master the many different games, you can even play children's songs on a keyboard and compose your own pieces for up to five instruments. Thanks to the Nintendo DS stylus, every game can be operated very intuitively.

At the beginning of the game, the music novices find themselves in the Mozart city of Salzburg. There are many educational games waiting for you on the market square, in the grocery store or in the Mozart House. Together with the clever Little Amadeus you have to master all these games. The aim is to get hold of the valuable golden clefs. These keep unlocking new rooms, all the way to Hohensalzburg Fortress, in which a magnificent piano awaits to be played in a throne room. In this lovingly designed world, the player meets many characters from the well-known animated series, for example Sister Nannerl, the cheeky rat Monti or Little Amadeus' competitor Mario. Learning by doing
Thanks to the many different games, the student gets a great insight into music theory. In doing so, it fills in missing notes, recognizes harmonic triads or traces notes on the touchscreen. In addition, there are numerous quiz questions about Mozart's musical world and a lot of information about the classical instrument families. In doing so, Tivola uses all the possibilities of the Nintendo DS optimally, so that an all-round successful learning experience can arise.
