In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.

Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster. The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage. The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them. On the opposite side certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster. 

There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players.
