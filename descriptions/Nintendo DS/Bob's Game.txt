Bob's Game (stylized as "bob's game") is a role-playing video game under development since 2003 or 2004 by independent video game developer Robert Pelloni. The project is most notable for Pelloni developing the game for the Nintendo DS, using open source software development tools, and Nintendo's refusal to license him the official SDK.
