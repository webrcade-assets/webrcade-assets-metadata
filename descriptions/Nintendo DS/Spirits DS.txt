Spirits DS is a remake for the Nintendo DS game based on the popular TOPO SOFT SPIRITS which in 1987 performed the corresponding versions for computers 8-bit MSX, Spectrum and Amstrad.

The project's goal is to make a remake to keep the spirit of the original, but adapted to the possibilities of the Nintendo console. It includes two versions, original graphics, drawn directly from the MSX version and an enhanced version, with graphics by graphic designers from the NightFox team.

It is presented in the NEO Retro Coding Compo 2012.  [gamebrew.org]
