Crazy Frog: Collectible Art School on DS is a game that turns your stylus into a brush and makes you repaint images inspired by the Crazy Frog license. Use your colored pencils and gouache tubes to color all the illustrations on offer. Complete mini-games to get new brushes, papers, colors and be talented because your drawings are judged once completed.
