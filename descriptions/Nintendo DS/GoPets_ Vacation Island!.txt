Share your pets with others around the world!



GoPets brings together a community of virtual pet owners in which players create and train a virtual dog or cat, watch as their pet develops its own personality, appearances and hobbies. Players can also take the pet online through Nintendo’s Wi-Fi connection service to make friends with other pet owners from around the world using both Nintendo DS and PC versions of the game.

As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo DSi and Wii systems has been retired. Online features of this game are no longer available after this date but this game still provides an entertaining experience in offline mode.
