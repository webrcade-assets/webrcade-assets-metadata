LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is an action game and the sequel to LEGO Batman: The Videogame. Just like the first game it draws elements from the Batman universe but built entirely in LEGO-style bricks. It starts when a "Man of the Year" award ceremony in Gotham City is interrupted by the Joker and a gang of bandits. Bruce Wayne is a candidate for the award and changes into Batman to pursue them, teaming up with members of the Justice League.
