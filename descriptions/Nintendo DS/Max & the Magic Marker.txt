Max & the Magic Marker is a platform game with gameplay elements similar to Crayon Physics where the magic marker is controlled by the mouse and is used to create physics objects such as platforms and boxes to assist Max in his adventure. The Magic Marker is used by the player to create bridges, platforms and heavy objects to help Max cross caverns, rise up on moving objects, or be propelled in the air via a see-saw.
