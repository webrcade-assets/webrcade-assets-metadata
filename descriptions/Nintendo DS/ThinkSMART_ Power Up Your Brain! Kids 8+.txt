A child-centric version of Conspiracy Entertainment's "brain-training" series, ThinkSMART: Kids offers younger players 18 different ways to improve their language, memory, math, reasoning, recognition, and logic skills. A "Training" mode lets gamers prepare for the challenges of "Career" mode, offering separate coaches to both girls and boys, and featuring extensive feedback regarding progress. Those looking for human competition can join friends for local hotseat contest, small single-cart multiplayer quizzes, or multi-cart quizzes featuring all 18 games.
