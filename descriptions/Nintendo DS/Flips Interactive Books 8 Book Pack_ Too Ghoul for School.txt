If your kids enjoy a good book, but you still have trouble getting them to read, then try turning on your DS instead. This unique interactive adventure contains eight of B.Strange's classic Too Ghoul For School books, all on a single cartridge and featuring some amazing multimedia additions.

St Sebastian's School is accepting new DS students. Click the links to learn more about each character. Ghoulish pictures and sounds accompany every story. Wipe the goop away if you want to keep reading.

Holding the DS vertically like a book you can turn pages simply by flicking the stylus across the touchscreen. Adults and children can read together and use the special in-built hyperlinks to access relevant pictures, sounds and character and location information.

To keep reading though you'll have to keep wiping away disgusting dirt and goop that piles up on every page. Eagle-eyed kids can also have fun spotting special pictures of spiders, cockroaches, rats and other nasties and by collecting them all they can unlock extras like mini-games and jokes. All kids love to read, this just helps them to enjoy the experience even more.
