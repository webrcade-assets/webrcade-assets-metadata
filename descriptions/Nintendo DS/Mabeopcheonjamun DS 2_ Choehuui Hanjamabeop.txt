A Hanja educational training game (a writing system that incorporates Chinese characters into the Korean language) that released only in Korea for the Nintendo DS. A sequel released two years after the first game ('Magic Hanja 1000 DS'), it received a lot of reviews compared to its predecessor.

The story is based on the contents of the comic book 'Magic Thousand Characters, an educational series based on the original Chinese novel 'Journey to the West'. It covers the events of volumes 10 through 20, but since the game was released before the 19th and 20th volumes came out, the content is completely different from the original comics.
