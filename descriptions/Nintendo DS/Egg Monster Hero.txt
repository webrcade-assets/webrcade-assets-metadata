Egg Monster Hero is a role playing game spinoff of the Hanjuku Hero. Between Egg Monster invasions, Lord Almamoon has begun slacking off. In order to counteract this, his minister Sebastian sends him to an island to train, which kicks off the story. Egg Monster Hero was released on the Nintendo DS in Japan on March 24, 2005, and was the first game Square Enix published for that console.

Players primarily interact using the stylus to drag Egg Monsters towards the enemy and perform special attacks.
