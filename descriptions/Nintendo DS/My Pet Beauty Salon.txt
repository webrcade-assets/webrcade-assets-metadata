In this game the player runs a luxury resort for pets. Pets owners bring their little darlings to the resort and you have to sell them the right products and services. Part of the game is a pet care simulation, i.e. you must stroke and feed the animals and play with them. The other part is business management; you need to order different foods and supplies and can extend the resort if you have made enough money. You can build facilities like hotel rooms for cats and dogs or a beauty salon for pets.
