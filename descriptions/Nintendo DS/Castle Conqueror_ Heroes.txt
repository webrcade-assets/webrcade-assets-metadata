Be a hero: become a castle conqueror on "The Green Planet"!

When, fearing the outbreak of war, the government of The Green Planet surrendered to “The Empire”, The Empire sent a commander called Vilost to the planet. The new rulers then imposed heavy taxes and assumed military control, leaving the people to suffer extreme hardship under the strict regime. A revolt finally broke out, and a rebel leader emerged in the south of the planet; with this leader, the revolt grew in strength and number against The Empire. The leader is a woman called Veronica, and she is attempting to release the citizens imprisoned by the regime who are eager to join her rebel army. You were once a great soldier, and in joining the revolt, your objective (as well as that of your new forces) is to drive The Empire from your planet!
