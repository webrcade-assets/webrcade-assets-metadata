Which Witch is Which? Liddell is a young witch-in-training who wants to be the greatest witch in the world, but she isn't willing to work for it. One day, she discovers a secret tome that unleashes an evil witch that has been sealed away for hundreds of years. Now accompanied by the tome's vampire guardian and newly-appointed babysitter, Loue, Liddell is forced to go on a journey to fix her mistake. In a Witch's Tale, the stylus becomes your magic wand. Control the entire game with the stylus! The intuitive magic battle system simply lets you touch and slide spells onto attacking enemies.
