In Zoo Keeper for the DS, you can see if you have what it takes to take care of all the animals in a zoo. Maintain an orderly zoo by using the stylus to match up animals on the screen. Once you've lined up three or more animals of the same type, the animals are captured, and more animals fall in their place. Zoo Keeper features a variety of gameplay modes as well as wireless multiplayer capabilities.
