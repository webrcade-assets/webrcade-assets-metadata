After the Mario Bros. and Peach return from there vacation on Yoshi's island, Bowser Jr. kidnaps Princess Peach once again, forcing Mario to run off to get Princess Peach. As Mario passes throughout the seven worlds (and possibly a secret world), he makes it to Bowser's Castle, where he fights Bowser and finally rescues the princess.
