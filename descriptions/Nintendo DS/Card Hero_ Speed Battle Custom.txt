Card Hero Speed Battle Custom is a DSiWare video game released in 2009 in Japan. The game is a sequel of sorts to Kousoku Card Battle: Card Hero, which was released in Japan in 2007. In the game, players will collect cards and use them in battle against other players. The player can choose to fight against computer controlled characters or human players. A mode in the game allows the player to fight using a different deck every day. The decks have special themes depending on when you play (such as special summer themes during summer). The game supports Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and local multiplayer.

When the player has the retail video game Kousoku Card Battle: Card Hero inserted in the DS slot, they will be able to get a rare card and 1,000 free in-game points which can be used to purchase items in the in-game shop.
