Every day is a snow day with Disney Frozen: Olaf's Quest, the new, puzzle platformer video game based on the animated movie of the same name from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures! Following the events of the film this original adventure throws the focus to Olaf, the happy-go-lucky snowman, as he tries to hold himself together through all the perilous situations he stumbles into.

An Icy (and Dicey) Adventure - Players must guide Olaf across 60 imaginative levels inspired by the mythical kingdom of Arendelle, navigating stimulating but accessible challenges, icy hazards and encountering mischievous natives while discovering hidden collectibles and unlockable accessories along the way.
