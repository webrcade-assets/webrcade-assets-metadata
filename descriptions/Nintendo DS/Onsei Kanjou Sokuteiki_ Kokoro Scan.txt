Onsei Kanjou Sokuteiki: Kokoro Scan (音声感情測定器 ココロスキャン) is a Nintendo DS game.
While all games from Sega's Naruhodo edutainment series did not garner much mention, this game did. This is due to it's bizzare premise and unique use of the Nintendo DS microphone picking up nuances in emotions of the voice. This technology was developed by SGI Japan.[3]
