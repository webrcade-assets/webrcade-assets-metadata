English of the Dead is an educational game and spin-off of Sega's The House of the Dead series, just like The Typing of the Dead. The game teaches English vocabulary by displaying a Japanese word for each approaching zombie. To kill the zombies, one has to write the correct English translation of its corresponding Japanese word. Words are written using the stylus on the touch screen.
