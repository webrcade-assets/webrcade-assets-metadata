Gyakuten Saiban Jiten is an encyclopedia of sorts for the first three games in the Ace Attorney series, as well as the DS-exclusive case from the original game (Rise from the Ashes). It was released for the Nintendo DS as a part of the Japanese Limited Edition version of Gyakuten Saiban 4 (Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney), and contains character profiles, evidence lists, character animations, opening cinematics, background images, music from the game, and so on. It did not see an international release.

The main objective of the game is to read information about the cases from the first three games in the series. Each section in the encyclopedia details information about each case (i.e., case synopses, character profiles, and location information), with a particular section being unlocked after being viewed in the index page, which contains a list of all the sections for easy viewing. As sections are unlocked, the game's completion percentage in the index page will increase. Other features include a library of background music from each game and a gallery of each character's animations (including some animations that were cut from the final game).
