Maths Training, designed to be played daily, uses a method called "The Hundred Cell Calculation Method" that focuses on repetition of basic arithmetic. This method was developed by Professor Kageyama who works at the Centre for Research and Educational Development at Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto. Utilizing a 10 x 10 grid of blank squares lined with rows of numbers along the top and side of the grid, the player has to match up each top number with each side number and add or subtract or multiply them. They then fill in the appropriate square with the appropriate answer. 

The game is played by holding the Nintendo DS vertically like a book, and it supports both right- and left-handed users, allowing them to view the exercises on the message screen while they note down their answers with the stylus on the Touch Screen. The user can play against up to 15 other Nintendo DS users by using the DS Download Play option or with multiple game cards.
