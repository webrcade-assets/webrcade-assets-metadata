Arthur and the Invisibles is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Unlike the action adventure games of the same name for the PC, PlayStation 2, PSP and Game Boy Advance, the Nintendo DS version features completely different game play.

The game's challenge mode features 90 different micro games which can be played. Each game tests the player's reflexes. Most of these games are played with the stylus. Games have to be unlocked through setting good scores. A number of micro games can be played in multi-player through WiFi.

Additionally the game features a Virtual Pet Simulator mode. In this game mode the player has to take care of a fictional fluffy flying creature from the film called a "Mul Mul". The player can unlock items in the challenge mode that can be used to entertain the Mul Mul. Players can stroke and slap the pet using the stylus. It is also possible to let Mul Mul breed with other player's Mul Mul through the DS's wireless capabilities.
