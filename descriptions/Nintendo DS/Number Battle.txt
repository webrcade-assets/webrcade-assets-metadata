From Japan comes a new kind of board game that combines puzzle and strategy in a battle of wits. Take turns against human or computer opponents to reach a target score, by placing numbered tiles on the board.

Score points by linking the arms of each tile in various ways: tiles with the same number or sequence of numbers, and tiles in a loop. Also look out for special squares that affect play in new ways, and useful items that aid you in your pursuit of points.

Go it alone in the main Story or Puzzle modes, or battle against up to three opponents across the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. You can even learn from your past with History mode, showing the moves recorded during previous Nintendo WFC contests.
