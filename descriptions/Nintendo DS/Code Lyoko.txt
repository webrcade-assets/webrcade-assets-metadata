Join Yumi, Ulrich, Odd and Jeremy in their fight to save planet Earth and the parallel universe Lyoko from total destruction! The central computer that runs Lyoko, has been infected by a megalomaniacal virus, X.A.N.A, that wants to take over the world. Within Lyoko one virtual being by the name of Aelita is fighting to take X.A.N.A. down, but she can't do it alone, and has recruited a team of boarding school students from Earth to help her.
