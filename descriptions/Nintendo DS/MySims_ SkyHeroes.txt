Take off as Pilots. Land as Heroes!



Take to the sky to lead the resistance against Morcubus and his drone army and to stop his plans to take over the skyways. MySims SkyHeroes is an all new adventure that brings the thrill and high speed action of flying to the creative, immersive world of MySims.

Go from unknown pilot to celebrated hero as you test your reflexes in fast-paced speed challenges and defeat dangerous enemies in aerial dogfights that demand all your skill as a pilot to survive. As you progress, you build, customize and tune your aircraft to give you an edge in combat – upgrade your wings for swifter maneuvers, switch out your engine for a speed boost, or change the paint job to camouflage your plane and avoid enemy fire.

Face Morcubus’ drones with an ally in two-player cooperative online gameplay, or challenge your friends in fun, competitive four-player high speed action.

Morcubus and his drones must be stopped; will you rise to the challenge?!
