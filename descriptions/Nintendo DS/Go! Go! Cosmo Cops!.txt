Go! Go! Cosmo Cops! invites players to jump into the shoes of Leo and Jenny as they touch, flip and get rowdy in a battle against the resource-sucking Babools to save the earth.

Using the ‘Accro Bracelet’ to give Leo and Jenny incredible super-powers, your job is to reach the top and take down the evil Babools by any means necessary.
