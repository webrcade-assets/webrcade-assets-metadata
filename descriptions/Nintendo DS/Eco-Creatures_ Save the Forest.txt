Eco-Creatures: Save the Forest is a real-time strategy game where the player controls creatures called Ecolis (squirrels), Ecoby (flying squirrels) and Ecomon (beavers). The story is about a fantasy world where a beautiful forest called the Mana Woods is overrun by monsters and pollution. The player must help these creatures reclaim their land, but not only do they control them, they can take care of them, developing new abilities and skills.

Each units have unique abilities: the ecolis grow healing trees that distributes health throughout the other units, the ecomon transports special items and news to Dorian (a elder creature of the woods that helps the player along during the game) and ecoby build bridges and dams which helps units cross bodies of water.

Players must also watch their units "Mana" which can determine how they will fight during a battle. The lower the "Mana" the better the chance they will flee while the highest will have the creature fight till the bitter end. These are determined of how players react to situational cutscenes throughout the game.
