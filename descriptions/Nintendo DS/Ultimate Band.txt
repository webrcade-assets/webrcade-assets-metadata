Ultimate Band allows players to play guitar, drums, bass or be the front man or woman in a band (though vocals are not supported). Ultimate Band features support for Disney Interactive's DGamer community network. The game will also feature connectivity between the Wii and DS versions, with DS players being able to control stage lighting and effects using the touch screen while a band performs on the Wii.
