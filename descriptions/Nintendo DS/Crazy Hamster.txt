Winter is coming, but Crazy Hamster has forgotten to store up supplies. Now he has to visit different lands to get them before winter sets in.

Crazy Hamster is so crazy, that he sees nothing but the tempting fruits in his path.
The lands he visits are full of traps and obstacles but he doesn't even notice. You have to help him and neutralise those traps. There's no time to lose! Crazy Hamster has already set off!
