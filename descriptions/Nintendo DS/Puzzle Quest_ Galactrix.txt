Like the original Puzzle Quest, Galactrix has Bejeweled-style gameplay with a few exceptions. Tiles are now hexagonally shaped and gravity will be a factor in how they fall. If the match takes place in orbit around a planet, the tiles will always fall downward but if you are fighting in open space new tiles will come from whatever direction you made your previous move.
