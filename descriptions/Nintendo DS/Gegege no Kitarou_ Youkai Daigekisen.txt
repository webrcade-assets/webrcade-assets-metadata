The one-eyed goblin named Kitaro returns to the video gaming fold in a remake of an old 8-bit Famicom game. Kitaro traipses around in 2D environs with his left eye named Medama-oyaji and battles fellow goblins, spooks, and end-level bosses of the undead sort. Kitaro can fire off projectile attacks and glide around by hefting an makeshift "parachute" over himself to traverse wide distances and platforms.
