This game features online play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and official licenses. The game also features a new World Tour mode, which adds a spin on Master League from previous games. Here, you play as a generic team traveling across the globe playing every nation included in the game until you are victorious. Along the way, you are awarded silver and gold medals which can be used to purchase international footballers from a touch-screen-manipulated gumball machine.
