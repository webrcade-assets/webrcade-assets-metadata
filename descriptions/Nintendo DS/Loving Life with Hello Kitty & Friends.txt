Hello Kitty returns to help out her friends any way she can in Loving Life with Hello Kitty & Friends. She can now help her friends out in the shopping mall and even help with their homework. Take Hello Kitty shopping, decorate her room, and choose her clothes. Loving Life with Hello Kitty & Friends features all of Hello Kitty’s best friends.

Play with Hello Kitty and her friends over five distinctive areas, including Hello Kitty’s room, the shops, the food court, and playing with Hello Kitty’s friends. In Hello Kitty’s room you can customize furniture, clothing, and accessories. At the shops you can put on unique uniforms, play fun mini-games, and help out Hello Kitty’s friends. In the food court you can work to earn Puro (the in-game currency), and play more mini-games based on the shop you choose to work in. You can then use the Puro you’ve earned to purchase goods and visit Hello Kitty’s friends.
