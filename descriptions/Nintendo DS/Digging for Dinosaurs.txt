Digging for Dinosaurs is a game of exploration, puzzle solving, and action, based on facts and theories of modern paleontology. Guided by a friendly professor character, players search for clues about the habits and habitats of more than 20 best-known dinosaur species. Young gamers have a chance to play as each new creature they discover, taking control of it in its own mini-game adventure. As players progress, the game shows how fossils are created and demonstrates the scientific method. The dinosaur adventure stories also aim to debunk common myths, and separate legends from scientific evidence. Scholastic's Digging for Dinosaurs is designed for players ages 5 to 8 years old.
