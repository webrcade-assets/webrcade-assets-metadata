The Flaw are everywhere! They surround us but are undetectable with human eyes. Using your state of the art weapon you must track these enemies, as they are all around you. It’s a simple process… get them, before they get you. Using the radar, watch for the Flaw all around you and shoot to kill the enemies before they reach you.

This innovative, action shooter uses the Nintendo DSi camera to turn your surroundings into the playing environment! Truly unique and totally physical, with 100 levels of action and 360 degrees of intensity, ‘Flaw’ is the future of handheld gaming excitement.
