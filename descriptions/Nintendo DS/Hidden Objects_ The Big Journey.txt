Hidden Objects -- The Big Journey. It was developed by Cerasus.Media and published by Cerasus.Media for NDS.
You’re on a deserted dream-island somewhere in the Caribbean. The biggest adventure of our time begins here … although you are only here on vacation and finally want to find your one true love! Then there is a kidnapping, murder. Is it really the old Mayan spirits making trouble, as the natives believe, or is there something more behind it? You take to the search and find a dark secret, the key to the biggest treasury ever created by human hands. You have barely endured the one adventure, when your job as star journalist brings you into a region that couldn’t be more different: 10,000 kilometres further east, Europe, Berlin...

Visit more than 40 locations, search in the most different ways in over ten game modes and master the numerous mini-games in this one-of-a-kind Hidden Object Adventure!
