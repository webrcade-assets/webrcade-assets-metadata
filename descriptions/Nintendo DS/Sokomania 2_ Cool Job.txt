The work of a warehouse keeper has never been so tough! Will you earn the Cool Job?

Sokomania 2 enhances the popular gameplay principles with many new dynamic features. The traditional maze full of crates that have to be pushed to the right spots is just an opening warm-up in Sokomania 2. Everything changes the instant momentum comes into play; crates start to move on their own, corridors become divided with doors, and switches or turntables that can change the direction in which crates move appear on the floor. At moments like these, one has to start thinking hard or patiently experiment with various possibilities.
