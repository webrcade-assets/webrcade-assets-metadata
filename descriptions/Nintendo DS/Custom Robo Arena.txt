Design your own customized robot warrior and control it in battle in this sci-fi adventure for Nintendo DS.

Custom Robo: The sport of tomorrow. In the not-too-distant future, competitors battle customized robot warriors in holographic battle arenas. Victory is determined not only by fighting skill but also by how well Robo Commanders design their robot gladiators, so players need both brawn and brains to survive.

Explore a sci-fi landscape as you fight toward the Custom Robo championship, powering up your Robos with tons of unique parts. There are literally millions of possible Custom Robo combinations, giving you complete control over how you fight your battles.

Players can challenge their friends to one-on-one Robo battles anytime and anywhere using either Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, Multi-Card Play or DS Download Play.

Outside of the battle arenas, Custom Robo Arena plays like a role-playing game in which players walk through the futuristic city setting and interact with other characters as they struggle to win the Custom Robo championship.
