TINcan Escape! has the solid foundation of an interesting innovation on the puzzle genre, but it's let down by too many easy stages, hard-to-predict AI, an uneven difficulty curve and not enough variation or creativity in the majority of levels. All in all, this robot's too rusty to provide anything more than a decent experience.
