Not to be confused with the 2008 game of the same name, America's Next Top Model is about starting your own modeling career and proving your talent to the judges during photo shoots, on the catwalk and through your overall style. Following the same successful formula as the TV series, one model is dismissed each week following a special challenge - just make sure it's not you.
