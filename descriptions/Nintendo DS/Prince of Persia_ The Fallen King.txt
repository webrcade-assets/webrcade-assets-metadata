Prince of Persia: The Fallen King is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Casablanca. The game was released for the Nintendo DS in December 2008, as a spin-off of Prince of Persia. The plot, taking place in ancient Persia, concerns the player character's role in a celestial battle between two gods; Ahriman and Ormazd.
