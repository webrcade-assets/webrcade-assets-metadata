Based on the novel by Akagawa Jirou, the story puts you in a role of a high-school teacher who due to a painful breakup leaves his old workplace and comes to a far away place to start a new job at Bell Garden school. While taking a stroll, a woman's scream is heard... you run to see what is happening, and the mystery begins. You can select main character to be a man or a woman, which slightly influences the game scenario (when the player is a man, his partner will be a woman and vice-versa).

Game progress advances as a mystery novel. As the case becomes obvious you will investigate and use deductive skills to find out the culprit and the motive behind the crime. During the gameplay you can visit various places and check the map of the Bell Garden school and its surroundings. During investigation and story progress, you will use a character correlation diagram to connect a certain person with the matter at hand. Also, the diagram can be used to make relations between characters (for example to mark them as lovers). Story can have more endings, depending on the player's deduction and skills to solve the case. After a solved case, if available, a new scenario will open.
