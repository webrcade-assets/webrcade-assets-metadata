As a new student at the Pin Creux equestrian center, the young Emily quickly gets to know the other female riders Lisa, Steph, Carole and Veronica, then with Max, the boss of the place. Emily's goal is to learn how to ride but also to become popular enough with her classmates to join their Grand Galop club. In the game, gaining popularity means "I am your slave and I take care of everything for you, send me any item, I will bring it back, and by the way I will clean your horse for you" . This rather incongruous vision of friendship is put forward from the first seconds of play when one of the girls asks us to "help her" to pick apples. First, there is only one apple to take, then the fruit is placed two meters away from her. Did she really need help? The tone is given, the rest of the game will be a succession of absurd tasks stupidity interspersed by idle trips back to the four corners of the center.
