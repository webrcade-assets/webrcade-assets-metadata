This is a puzzle game in which players lead various animals to respective barns placed on a grid-like map. Players must avoid pitfalls and cliffs, use objects on the field to their advantage, and solve each level with the fewest number of moves. After clearing a stage, players are able to unlock a picture of female characters, including the main girl, Sherry. Some of these pictures depict characters in semi-provocative attire or poses (e.g., short skirts, garter belts, and blouses with straps dangling off).
