Dinosaurs once ruled the earth. Now, you rule them!

Just as the second season of the Dinosaur King TV series kicks off on the Kids WB this September, you will be able to excavate, battle and trade your favorite dinosaurs from the show on your Nintendo DS!

As Max or Rex, members of a dinosaur-hunting team called the D-Kids, excavate realistic dinosaur fossils from all over the world using the Touch Screen – you’ll even blow off the dirt covering them using the DS microphone. Once you bring them to life in 3D with the amazing DinoShot invention, take your favorite beast into battle. Collect and trade over 100 unique species of dinosaurs as you journey to stop the evil Alpha Gang from using the mighty creatures to take over the world. With special moves and various battle strategies, you and a friend will have a blast competing head-to-head to find out who is the ultimate king of the dinosaurs!
