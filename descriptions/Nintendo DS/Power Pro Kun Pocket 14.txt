Power Pro-kun Pocket 14 is a 2011 Baseball simulator + dating sim + card game - turn based RPG developed by Pawapuro Production, formerly Diamond Head, and published by Konami for the Nintendo DS. The Baseball simulator has an optional rule that lets players perform super moves and the Mini Success mode formerly called "Guppy" now comes with actual storylines for both of its difficulty modes.

A new Card Baseball system is introduced for the Inner Success mode that replaces the turn based RPGs from previous installments. In it, a Baseball match is played as a board game and players can build decks of cards with various effects.
