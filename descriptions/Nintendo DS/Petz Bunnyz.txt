Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with bunnies.

Like in other games of the series for the DS, the player have to care for his/her pet by feeding it, bathing it, brushing it and such tasks. There are 7 mini-games too, that help giving food, toys and items for the environment where the bunnies live. And thanks to the wireless connection to other DSs, bunnies and other items can be shared with friends.
