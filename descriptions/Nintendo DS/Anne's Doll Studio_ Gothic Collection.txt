Dress up a stylish doll by choosing from a wide range of Gothic-style dresses and accessories.

Use the stylus to choose hairstyles, hair accessories, dresses, jackets and shoes, mixing and matching items to create hundreds of beautiful combinations. Once your doll is complete you can choose from various backgrounds and border designs to create a stunning picture with your doll at center stage. Alternately, you can set your doll against the background of your choice by taking your own picture using the Nintendo DSi™ system’s built-in camera. You can further decorate your doll by adding stars and other pretty effects or by drawing freehand. Your completed doll pictures can be saved to an SD Card (sold separately), traded with friends, used on social networks or printed out from a computer.
