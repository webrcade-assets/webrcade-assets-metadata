Another game in the Ubisoft's Imagine series of games that show female children and early teenagers the basics of some of the professions culturally assigned to women.

This time the player learns to be a fashion designer and a boutique owner. The process of creating a clothing line goes from designing the patterns and colors of the clothes, to choosing the make up and the hairstyle of the models, producing the catwalk shows and even directing the photo shoots for your portfolio.

In addition, the game allows sending your creations to other NDSs through the wireless connection.
