My Asian Farm is a breeding simulation game! At the beginning, all you own is an empty field, a little money and a single little hen. You need to feed the hen and take care of it!

Then your hen will lay eggs which can be sold, earning you money that can be spent to buy new animals at the Farmersâ€™ Market and equipment from the Shopkeeper.

Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses (a pagoda, a rickshaw, a guard dog, etc) and you will be able to exchange your animals with your friends who play My Farm, My Exotic Farm, My Asian Farm or My Australian Farm!
