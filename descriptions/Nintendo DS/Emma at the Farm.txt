'Emma At The Farm' is an adventure game where players must help the eponymous character Emma to carry out several tasks on a farm and meet various types of farm animal characters.

In the game, Emma spends the day on the farm with her uncle Jules. However, everything is in chaos as Aunt Lucy is away on holiday for a week, Teresa the hen's baby chicks are missing and there's word of a fox lurking around! It's up to the player to help Emma keep everything right again along with her trusty canine companion Pickles.

Gameplay mainly involves using the Nintendo DS stylus to carry out several tasks like rubbing straw to collect eggs, moving certain objects around to gather bundles of hay, collecting fruit and vegetables and so on. The Nintendo DS microphone is also utilised to blow dandelion seeds, as well as calling Neddy the donkey towards Emma at one point in the story (Microphone sensitivity can be adjusted in the Options menu).

At any time during the story, you can press Start to bring up a menu that allows you to resume the story, replay any of the activities during the adventure, check out the bonuses you've unlocked and even go back to the main title screen.

Throughout the game, players can unlock bonuses as they progress through the story. These include a matching game (match the animal parents), a vegetable garden to water your own fruit and vegetable plants, a wardrobe that allows players to dress up Emma in several costumes and a recipe book that contains several recipes for many yummy treats to cook at any time!
