Appropriate behavior at the table and a feeling for the right etiquette don't just fall into people's laps. An experienced teacher and sufficient training are part of being able to perform safely and correctly everywhere.

The historical writer and namesake Freiherr Adolph Franz Friedrich Ludwig Knigge had a great deal of experience in dealing with people properly and, as a virtual character, will provide players of all ages on the Nintendo DS with valuable insights into the rules of formal dealings.

Etiquette - Playing Good Behavior includes three main areas:
* 21 mini-games on various themes related to good manners and general education. Each game has its own small tutorial, three levels of difficulty and a high score list
* An interactive course with 16 chapters to unlock the mini-games
* An encyclopedia with five "books" to look up and to prepare for special social events

Minigames:
Knigge has 21 entertaining mini-games with different game principles and more than 3,300 different tasks that will test the players' knowledge. Six of the 21 mini-games can also be played in multiplayer mode by two or three players against each other on a Nintendo DS to test and compare your own knowledge.
