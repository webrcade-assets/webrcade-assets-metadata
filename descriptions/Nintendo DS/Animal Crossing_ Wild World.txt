Cross over to a brand new world!

Much of the cast of the original Animal Crossing returns, including animals of all shapes and personality types: K.K. Slider, Tom Nook, Blathers, Mr. Resetti and more. There are also a number of new characters.

Players move into village, buy a small house and then do whatever they want. Time and seasons pass as they do in the real world, so there will always be something unpredictable happening. Collect or buy items, talk to neighbors, go fishing, catch bugs, dig up treasure or hang out with human friends.
