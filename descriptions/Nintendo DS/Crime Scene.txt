Crime Scene is a law enforcement detective game with focus on forensics, much like CSI game series. The protagonist of the story is Matt Simmons, a young detective recently promoted from forensics. The story takes place in Crossburg town, where a police detective and his wife are found dead. As a detective, you will have to find out the truth behind their deaths, was it suicide or homicide, find clues, gather evidence, find out the motive and bring the perpetrators to justice.
