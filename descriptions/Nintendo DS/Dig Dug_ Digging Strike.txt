Twenty years later, the master digger returns to save the world!

The arcade classic returns with a dual screen twist and all new gameplay. Monsters are terrorizing the islands! Classic enemies Pooka and Fygar plus a host of new bosses are causing trouble and it's up to Dig Dug and his crew to sink the islands and drive these critters into the sea.

Players explore 3D environments to pinpoint fault lines that will trap the boss monsters, then dig on the bottom screen to connect fault lines until the islands break apart but timing is critical. Trapping the monsters behind fault lines on the upper screen requires skill and timing - players may trap themselves if they don't plan!

Dig ahead in single player or go head-to-head wirelessly with a friend, Dig Dug Digging Strike offers everyone non-stop action on the go!

• VARIETY OF FUN STAGES. Clear 15 stages and over 80 areas. Sink the enemy bosses to advance to the next area.
• COOL WEAPONS. Stop enemies or guide them through the tunnels with unique weapons and items. Utilize the elements to your advantage but watch out! Rolling rocks, quicksand, and flowing lava don't distinguish friend or foe!
• ITEM COLLECTION. Find and acquire items such as Fossil Fragments to unlock levels and special items to help you clear the most challenging levels.
• ALL "NEW" MINI-GAMES. Play parodies of classic Namco Games with "Horivalou" and "Hori X" to help Dig Dug break apart the islands.
