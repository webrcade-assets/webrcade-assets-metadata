In order to fight fires in the wild, a fireman needs an axe, a hose, and fire retardant robes. In order to fight fires on the Nintendo DS, all you need is a touchpen. Join a crew of fire fighters who venture bravely into infernos in order to rescue innocents and control raging fires. To shoot water at flames, simply tap on the target with the touchpen to drench and extinguish it. To break down doors and other obstacles, the axe may be used as a sort of battering ram.
In addition to normal flames, end level "boss" flames which are tougher to beat must also be contended with. The top screen shows an overhead map of the stage while all of the action takes place on the touch screen. Over 30 missions are featured in the game for DS firefighters to conquer.
