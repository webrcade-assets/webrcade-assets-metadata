The Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbaride Card Battle War (仮面ライダーバトル ガンバライドカードバトル大戦 Kādo Batoru Taisen) was released on July 29, 2010, featuring a modified game system as there is no on-board card reader for the handheld. The player controls a fan of the Ganbaride game who has to use his or her ability at the game to work for the DOLL paranormal research group who have discovered a weird bug in the game system. Meanwhile, an evil organization called "Bug" has come forward to use this dangerous game mechanic to their advantage.
