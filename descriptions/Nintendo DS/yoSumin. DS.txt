In Yosumin!, the player tries to select rectangular regions in a grid of tiles that have the same type of yosumin at all four corners. The player has a target goal of the number of rectangles with yosumin of specific types that must be removed, and has a time limit. The larger the rectangle selected, the greater the number of points the player receives. Special yosumin are sometimes included, which when removed can give extra time or points. Later in the game another type of yosumin is added which can be moved, allowing the player to create rectangles of larger size. In multiplayer mode, two players face off in a larger grid. Creating rectangles can remove time from the opponent's timer, and specific yosumin which are selected before the game begins perform other moves such as stunning the opposing player. Wireless two-player competitive mode is playable through game sharing on the Nintendo DS with a single cartridge. Enhancements included new block types such as a block that rearranges the boards layout.
