Get ready for some Easter fun with Amu and her guardian fairies (shugo chara). Amu appears cool and aloof, but in reality, she is really just clumsy with words and too shy to express herself. Her greatest wish is to change herself and her awkwardness. Her wish is answered one night in the form of three eggs that appears on her bed. They hatch to reveal three fairies Ran, Sue and Miki. Together with them, Amu joins the guardian team to defeat the dark forces that plagued her home town. And in her spare time, she trains to become more skillful in areas such as sports, cooking and school work with her sprites. And her ultimate aim is to win the heart of the man she likes.
