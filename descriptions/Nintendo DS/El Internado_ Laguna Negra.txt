The game will begin with the arrival of Marcos and Paula to the boarding school and chapter 1 will end with the death of
Cayetano, although the game skips some parts of the argument seen in these seasons, especially the
parts that correspond to the secondary frames of the argument. They will be four chapters in total, the fourth
will start as the fourth season but will end with an alternate ending of the original plot seen in the
"boarding" series
