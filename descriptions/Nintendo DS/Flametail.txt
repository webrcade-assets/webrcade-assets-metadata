Blaze a path across the galaxy in this unique puzzle game. Holding the Nintendo DSi vertically, you must plot a route for your Flametail pod, using its red hot exhaust trail to burn through obstacles on your way to the next planet. Manoeuvre around a maze of blocks to burn them away as your pod passes by to clear the stage. Fortunately, there are plentiful power-ups and items such as the Bomb to blast a wide radius, or Radar which grants you a map to aid your route. In the main Space Tour mode, journey from Earth into outer space on a block-burning and brain-busting voyage. Or set yourself a challenge against the clock in Time Limit mode. Plus â€“ if you achieve a high score, you can even take a photo of yourself with the inner camera of the Nintendo DSi system and show off your winning smile!
