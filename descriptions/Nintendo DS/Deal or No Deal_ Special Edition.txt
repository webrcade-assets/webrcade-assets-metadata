Based on the U.S. version of the internationally popular game show, Deal or No Deal: Anniversary Edition is a game of risky decisions and high-stakes bargaining. It is played with 26 numbered briefcases, each containing a different dollar amount, ranging from 1 to 1,000,000. The player begins by choosing briefcases to be removed from play, each of which is immediately opened and its contents revealed. The ultimate goal is to remove all briefcases except for the one containing the 1,000,000 dollar sum, which the player may then keep as prize money. Turn by turn, the player bargains with an unseen "banker" character, who offers the player a certain amount of money to give up the hunt for the 1,000,000 dollar briefcase, based on the remaining dollar amounts in the unknown cases. The North American Anniversary Edition of the game for Nintendo DS and Wii features stylized 3D representations of on-stage characters, including a cast of 26 briefcase-toting hostesses, and the voice of host Howie Mandel.
