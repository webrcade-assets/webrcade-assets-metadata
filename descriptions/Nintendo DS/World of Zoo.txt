World of Zoo simulates a zoo experience where the player can safely interact with animals using a first-person view. There are eleven major families of animals, and a small editor that allows the player to mix and match parts to create real or imagined species of animals. The goal of the game is to make the animals happy through constant direct interaction.

There is a large list of achievements ranging from cleaning up poo to building something new. The achievements unlock additional content in the game, providing the player with more options such as new animal parts, and new pre-made animals.
