The classic 80s game show "Press Your Luck" makes its video game debut. You are one of three contestants competing to collect "spins" by answering trivia questions, and then using your spins on the Big Board full of cash and prizes. The person who hauls in the most cash and prizes by the end of the game wins, but watch out for the dreaded Whammies - they'll steal your winnings! Press Your Luck 2010 Edition features hundreds of trivia questions and fun Whammy animations.
