After playing all these RPGs, aren't you itching to create one yourself? It doesn't matter even if you know nothing about the flow of the game, as long as you have some idea of a story, a character and what the dungeons look like, you can start game making with the help of RPG Tsukuru DS.

Decide on the heroes of your game then draw a map to define the characteristics of your world. Put in the story events into the game and there you go! Don't forget to sprinkle in some challenging monsters to fight and some cool items to win.

With stylus in hand and the game card in your DS, you are not a mere gamer, but a creator.
