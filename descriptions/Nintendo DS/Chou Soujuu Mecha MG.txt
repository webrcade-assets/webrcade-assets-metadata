Chou Soujuu Mecha MG is a Japan-exclusive game for the Nintendo DS released in 2006 that revolves around mech combat. Not unlike Capcom's infamous Steel Battalion series, players must manually operate each robot by using the touch screen as a control panel while still paying attention to the action as it unfolds on the upper screen, with the only non-touch screen controls generally being the directional pad/face buttons for lateral movement and rotation, as well as the shoulder buttons for camera control. Furthermore, each of the 100-plus different sorts of robots that can be collected and piloted in the game feature different control methods and features, making different types suitable for different sorts of missions.
