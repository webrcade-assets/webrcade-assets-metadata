Meitantei Conan: Tantei Ryoku Trainer is a "detective trainer" as it's designed to test and improve players' abilities in observation, memory, and logical thinking through a series of mini-games and puzzles, mimicking the challenges a detective might face such as spotting differences, solving logic puzzles, and recalling details from brief scenarios.
