What's Cooking? Jamie Oliver is a cooking game, and consists of two parts, a Cookbook part and a Cooking Game part.

The Cookbook part contains 100 step-by-step recipes by Jamie Oliver, a voice recognition function to go through the steps, tips by Jamie Oliver and a cooking timer to tell the player when to take the roast out of the oven, for example. Shopping lists for the recipes can be created and own entries can be added via virtual keyboard or handwriting recognition. Several filters for the recipes are available, so the player can filter for vegetarian recipes, or recipes containing eggs, or recipes with a cooking time of less than 30 minutes, for example.

The Cooking game consists of different Tutorials for different aspects of cooking, the Test Kitchen, where Jamie's recipes can be cooked in a virtual kitchen, a cook against the clock mode (Cooking Challenge) where ingredients have to be prepared really fast and a third mode, the creative cooking mode, where the player can combine all the unlocked ingredients to a dish of his/her own choice. The recipe can be named, categorized and saved later. These recipes can also be shared with friends via DS Wireless Communications, and they are stored in the Cookbook.
