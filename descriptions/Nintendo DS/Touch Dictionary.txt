Touch Dictionary is a dictionary software title for the Nintendo DS released in 2005 exclusively in South Korea. The dictionary offers translation to and from English, Japanese, and Korean. An advertisement for the game claims it offers 1.63 million words. The user enters the word to translate from the source language using the keyboard on the bottom screen. Above the keyboard, a list of possible source words is displayed. The user can choose between multiple words with similar spelling, such as touch (タッチ, tacchi) and Dutch account (ダッチ・アカウント, dacchi akaunto). The top screen displays the results of the search. The user can scroll between results using an on-screen scroll wheel on the right side of the lower screen. Additionally, the software has a calculator.
