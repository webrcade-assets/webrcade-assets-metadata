Zekky≈ç Senshi Sakeburein (roughly translated as Exclamation Warriors Sakeburein) is a Nintendo DS video game released in 2007. There is no single player mode in the game, as it's exclusive to multiplayer. The game was made available through Club Nintendo in Japan only. It's a beat-em up that makes heavy use of the DS's microphone, shouting in commands to make the superheroes perform them.
