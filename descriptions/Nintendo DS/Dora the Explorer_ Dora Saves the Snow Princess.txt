Grab your gloves and hat and get ready for a wintery journey with Dora. A mean witch put a spell on the Magic Snowy Forest and now it is starting to melt. With help from new friends like the Snow Fairy and everybody's favorites Boots, Swiper and Pirate Piggy you'll need to build a snowman, paddle a canoe, steer a dogsled and ride Pegasus by really moving that way with your Wii Remote.
