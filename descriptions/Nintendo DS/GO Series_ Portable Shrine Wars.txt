GO Series presents Portable Shrine Wars from Tom Create, makers of Defence Wars.

At summer festivals in Japan, dozens of people carry a huge portable shrine on their shoulders called a mikoshi. Now is your chance to go head to head carrying a mikoshi, barging your opponents' mikoshis into the crowd or flinging team members at them. Recruit men that have fallen from their own mikoshi to help you run faster and race to the finish.
