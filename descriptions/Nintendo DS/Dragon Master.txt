The land of Alradur has become barren and few can remember a time when the fields blosomed with life. Yet legends persist of a thriving time when land and sky were alive, and man and dragons shared the world in harmony. Legends also tell of the dragons treachery; of how they destroyed the Tree of Life, casting all of Alradur into its sullen state. But there is still hope. In a forgotten passage, it's pages scattered throughout the land, there is a prophecy of boy and a dragon who will reunite the races, revive
the Tree of Life, and bring back the order of the Dragon Masters, mightiest of
Alradur's heroes. Are you up to the task?
