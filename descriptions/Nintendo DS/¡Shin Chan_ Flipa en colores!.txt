Crayon Shin-chan is a long-running japanese manga series. It has also inspired over 50 video games, from Game Boy to Switch. Many of them have only been published in Japan, though quite a few have been also been published in South Korea, Italy and Spain.

First of the five DS games of the series, Â¡Shin Chan: Flipa en colores! is a pure platformer where Shin Chan must travel through the world of dreams supported by his markers, costumes and his unique charisma, to repair the damage that a small dream-eating pig has left behind.
