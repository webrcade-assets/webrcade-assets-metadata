This adventure game is based on the movies with the same title and the story takes place during the time between the first and the second movie. It is March 19th, 2003. In the bay area police jurisdiction, at a fort in Minato, a harbor ward in Tokyo, a male corpse was discovered. The victim seemed to have head bashed in. A special division stepped on the scene immediately and police headquarters dispatched a police detective, Shinji Muroi, to investigate the scene of the crime. Upon arrival, the local police informs Shinji of their preliminary findings and the victim's identity. Now he needs to find out what really happens, the motive behind the murder, and the perpetrator.

While the conversation dialogues do feel like a visual novel, the player character is established and appears on the screen during conversation with other characters, seeing on-screen characters from a profile instead of them looking at the screen. By visiting locations on the map, talking to other characters, questioning suspects, make logical deductions and play occasional mini-games, the player gets closer and closer to solving the crime.
