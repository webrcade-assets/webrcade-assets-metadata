Take on all-comers in the latest incarnation of the soccer series that gives you complete control over the biggest football stars on the planet. Bringing big match action to life on your DS, FIFA 08 includes stacks of new features that will put you on the pitch like never before. The game invites you to compete for silverware across the globe as you pick your favourite side from 30 complete leagues and master the skills of more than 14,000 real players. FIFA 08 draws you deep into the action by giving you the power to tinker with every last detail of the beautiful game. From positioning your goalkeeper at corners to picking the precise spot you want to place free kicks and penalties on the Touch Screen, this is football like you’ve never played it before! Adding to the thrill of competition in FIFA 08 is the inclusion of online matches via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Challenge someone on the other side of the planet to an international grudge match or put your mate in his place in a fast and furious derby game! You can even play another DS owner who doesn’t own FIFA 08 thanks to the Single-Card Play option. Advanced artificial intelligence means the opposition will be tougher to break down than ever before, but tweaking your formation to suit your style of play perfectly will level the playing field. Make your way down the tunnel and prepare to play the game of your life in FIFA 08.
