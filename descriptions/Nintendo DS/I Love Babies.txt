Have you always wanted to take care of a baby? This is your chance! Changing diapers, bathing, and feeding are all part of your daily chores as well as shopping, cooking, cradling your baby to sleep, dressing the little cutie or teaching him to crawl, stand and walk. Most of all, your baby needs your love to be really happy: lots of cuddles, playing and care taking will make him recognize you as his parent.
