Super Robot Wars K is the second Nintendo DS-released Super Robot Wars, which more or less reuses the visual and combat engine from Super Robot Wars W, with some new additions and some rather unorthodox debuting series as well. Once again, it has no Universal Century Gundam, no Getter Robo, and no Mazinger except for the original.
