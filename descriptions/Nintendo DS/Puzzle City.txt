Under the watchful eye of Mz. Towers, assemble buildings from color-coded construction blocks before the conveyor belt backs up in this unique combination of block-dropping puzzle inlay action and city-building simulations. Revitalize 48 different cityscapes as you build homes, factories, shopping malls, schools, fire stations, and more! Use power-ups to bulldoze unneeded buildings, freeze, reverse, break up or detonate construction pieces, and spray paint new colors!
