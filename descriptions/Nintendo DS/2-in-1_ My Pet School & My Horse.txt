My Pet School:

The player slips into the role of a pet trainer, learns the basics of animal training and trains the animals for different missions. First easy instructions need to be taught with patience and good knowledge for the dogs, parrots, cats, rodents and donkeys – later on more difficult tasks will be a challenge.

In the pet kindergarten cute little puppies and kittens have to be looked after to lay the foundation of successful training in the future! Creative training methods and lots of love will help the animals to pass tests like guide dog for the blinds and road safety.

Later on there will be lots of interesting missions when the pets play roles in comedy thrillers and other exciting productions. Furthermore the player has the possibility to go in for a career: to extend his knowledge and enlarge the pet school!
