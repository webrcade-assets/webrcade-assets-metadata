Kaitou Rousseau is a touch screen adventure game skillfully blended into a comic book set up. The entire tale of the game is told through panels where Rousseau (or Rusou as the kids call him), Seine and everyone else chat with pop up bubbles. On the bottom screen you can poke other characters like his classmates Shibun and Pochi to talk to them or tap on items to inspect them. After you are done with a screen it rolls up from the touch screen to the static top screen, just like if you flipped a page in a book. The top screen also serves as reference, which comes in handy when you need a quick clue.
