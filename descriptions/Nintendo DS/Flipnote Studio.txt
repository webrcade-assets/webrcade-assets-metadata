Flipnote Studio is a drawing and animation tool. Users can use the DSi stylus to sketch, paint, and stamp drawings, and can then use the provided tools to turn their drawings into animations. Sound effects can be added using the DSi microphone, and images from the DSi camera can be inserted as well.

Users can share animations with their friends, or upload their animations to the Flipnote Hatena website and share their creations with people around the world (separate registration necessary). Users may also download animations from the Flipnote Hatena service onto their DSi.
