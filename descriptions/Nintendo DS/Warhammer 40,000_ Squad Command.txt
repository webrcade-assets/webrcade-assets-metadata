Squad Command uses a turn-based gameplay system to mimic the play of the tabletop wargame. It features destructible 3D environments and over 20 weapons.

Squad Command uses Hit Points (HP) and Action Points (AP). Hit Points are used to calculate damage to a unit. When a unit's HP is reduced to zero they are removed from the battle as a casualty. Action Points represent the time a unit has to act in a round, and are expended when the unit moves or uses a weapon. Movement uses up varying amounts of AP depending on the distance moved, whereas weapons have a minimum amount allowable. The player can use more APs to aim a shot to increase accuracy. This is depicted by a band of fluctuating color, which tightens and darkens as more APs are spent. Terrain is destructible, allowing for sufficiently powerful weapons to destroy an object and simultaneously damage enemies taking cover behind it.

If a unit ends its turn with enough AP to fire their weapon they enter "Overwatch" mode during the enemy's turn. In Overwatch the first enemy unit that enters the Overwatch unit's line-of-sight is fired upon.

Some heavy weapons lower the amount of AP a unit may use in a turn, to simulate their weight and complexity.
