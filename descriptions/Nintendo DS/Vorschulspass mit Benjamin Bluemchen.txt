Benjamin Blümchen is probably the most famous elephant in the world and lives in Neustadt with his friend Otto and, as we all know, has already done one or the other exciting job. Whether it's a fireman, gardener, captain, baker or engine driver - up to now no job has been safe from the gray pachyderm. On the Nintendo DS, too, Mr. Blümchen does not splash out and teaches the little ones among us German spelling, math and a little bit of English. In the last few weeks I have put myself in the role of a preschooler for you and tested Benjamin Blümchen: Preschool Fun extensively.
