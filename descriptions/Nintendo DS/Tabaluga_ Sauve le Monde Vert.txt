The inhabitants of Greenland discover a dragon's egg within a cave beneath an uprooted tree. Soon after, a small green dragon hatches from it. The dragon's name is Tabaluga and his destiny is to protect his home - Greenland - from the evil snowman Arktos. Together with his friends, Tabaluga opposes Arktos' minions and their snow-driven machinery.

This Tabaluga game is a classic 2D Platform-Jump'n'Run adventure consisting of 26 levels and a variety of mini-games and comic-like cutscenes. It is a licensed title based on the popular German kids cartoon character (and musical) Tabaluga.

The game is released on two platforms, which are Nintendo DS and PC. Both versions are identical in gameplay and graphics, though the PC version does have additional decorative elements in order to fill the unused 4:3 screen space.
