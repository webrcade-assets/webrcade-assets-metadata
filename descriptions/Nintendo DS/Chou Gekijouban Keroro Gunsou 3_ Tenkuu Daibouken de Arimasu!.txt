"Chou Gekijouban Keroro Gunsou 3: Tenkuu Daibouken de Arimasu!" is a side-scrolling action game with some puzzle elements. It's based on the popular Japanese anime and manga series "Keroro Gunso" (Sgt. Frog). The series follows the comedic adventures of Sergeant Keroro, a frog-like alien who, along with his platoon, plans to conquer Earth but ends up in various misadventures instead. In this game, players embark on a grand adventure inspired by the third movie, where Keroro and his friends navigate through different worlds, each filled with unique challenges and enemies.

The game mechanics involve navigating side-scrolling levels with each character having unique abilities. Players can switch between characters like Keroro, who can perform double jumps and use his Keroball, or Giroro, who uses a beam rifle for ranged attacks. Collecting in-game items allows players to unlock special moves and progress through increasingly challenging stages.

The game includes parodies of classic Namco games, adding a nostalgic touch for fans.
