Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the final game in the series of Harry Potter movie adaptations. It closely follows the plot of the movie of the same name. Harry and his friends will have to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes and then face Lord Voldemort for the ultimate battle. 

The game is a single-player third person shooter, with magic spells substituting weapons. The game resembles its predecessor in most aspects, but the stealth sections from the previous game are omitted. The cover system has been tweaked. In different levels the player controls various characters from Harry Potter movies including Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Professor McGonagall and others.
