The KORG DS-10 Plus is an enhanced version of the revolutionary KORG DS-10 synthesizer software that was released to critical and retail acclaim for the Nintendo DS in late 2008. The original KORG DS-10 music-creation software, which combined the superior interface of the Nintendo DS with the functionality of the famous MS-10 synthesizer, has been optimized to essentially double the power of the original when used with the Nintendo DSi. The sound sources in the KORG DS-10 Plus come from KORG - one of the world's top musical instrument producers - and no effort was spared in creating these ultra-high-quality sounds. The Nintendo DSi/DS Touch Screen controls are used to the fullest to provide unsurpassed feel and operability. This innovative musical tool is perfect for aspiring musicians and professionals alike. In addition to the four analog synth simulators and drum module, a 12-track/16-step sequencer enables precise control and provides a wide range of musical possibilities (only two analog synthesizers and six tracks available when used with regular Nintendo DS). Up to eight units can be connected and played together through a wireless link for a jam session or to exchange songs. This and other features make the Nintendo DSi/DS and KORG DS-10 Plus almost limitless in their application - improved portable music creation performance at an unparalleled value.
