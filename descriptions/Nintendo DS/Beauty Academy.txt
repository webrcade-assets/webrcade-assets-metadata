Every successful salon owner also needs a bit of luck. In "Beauty Academy" this takes the form of a wizard that lives as a pig and turns the players' flat into a beauty salon. To make sure customers are satisfied, players have to use their gaming skills. Salon owners use the Nintendo DS-Touchpen to click on stars to perfect their customers' make-up, copy designs for body painting or give the best possible massage by drawing the right sequence of lines onscreen in the required time. The end of each chapter presents an even bigger challenge, featuring a client with special individual requests, such as an elderly lady who needs to get styled up for a date with her online acquaintance. With each task successfully solved, players gather points. These can then be invested in new furnishings such as a brand new photo studio or a high-tech massage table
