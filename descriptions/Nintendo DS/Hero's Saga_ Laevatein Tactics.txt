Little does he know that such a small choice will spark a war that will rage across the continent of Yulamecca and beyond... "Hero's Saga Laevatein Tactics really brings back the spirit of SRPGs of old," said Frank "Bo" deWindt II, Project Lead, Aksys Games. "You can definitely see bits and pieces of many SRPGs, like Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre, lending their influence to help inspire a stellar game."
