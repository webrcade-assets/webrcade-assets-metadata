Pony Friends 2 is a horse-care simulation game. Once the player's profile is created, a pony, either custom or chosen from pony market, can be acquired and named. More ponies can eventually be acquired from the pony market.

From the main menu, the Home, Stable and Town areas can be visited, and the Options, Friends Mode and Task List menus can be viewed.

Home is the place where the players will view the game progress, do chores and manage pony accessories and pictures taken while trail-riding, while the stable focuses more on pony care. From the stable, the pony can also go play in the field, or be ridden on trail rides and race circuits. The town contains many facilities such as the shop, the veterinarian and the pony club. The pony club is where the player gains access to races, tips, quests, and new tricks for the pony to learn.
