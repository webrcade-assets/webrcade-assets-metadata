Corvette Evolution GT (known as Evolution GT in Europe) is a racing video game similar to Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano. In the career mode, the player has to build up his character's experience points that will allow him to develop his stats. Getting either a bronze, silver, or gold medal in all the events is mandatory for a "season" to become complete. The game uses the miles per hour system by default; the maximum speed of vehicle will either increase or decrease depending on the player's chosen talent (e.g., swiftness, test driver) and the concentration of different statistics.
The Nintendo DS version is similar to its console counterpart, but it does not feature the attributes from them. It was developed by Jack Of All Games. It features only a part of the cars and tracks from the PlayStation 2 and Windows version (12 cars and 8 tracks, opposed to 33 cars and almost 30 tracks) and similar events appear in the game. It received a relatively lower ratings in the main critics (around 49% from 2 reviews on Metacritic).
