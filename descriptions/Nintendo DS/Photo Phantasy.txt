A spot-the-image game, using the DS's twin screens. Hold the DS on it's side, and the left and right sides display a slightly different image. Use the stylus to note the differences. There are two sets of powerups: hourglasses, which completely refresh your time needed for the level, and magnifying glasses, which automatically find one difference for you. Each story begins with a certain number of these powerups, with no way to replenish them.
