World Championship Games (WCG) gives you three single-player options, though each offers essentially the same experience. Quick Play gives you the option of selecting from any of the unlocked sports events for a quick fix on the go; Decathlon paces you through 10 events; Tournament seems to be pretty much the same thing as Decathlon, and we’re not at all sure why it’s been at added.

The menu system is fairly straightforward and easy to use. Regardless of which single-player option you choose, you’ll first be asked to select a difficulty setting – Rookie, Pro, or Advanced. You’ve got track events, jumping events, throwing, and targeting.
