One dark and stormy night, a lightning storm struck a house. This freak storm brought to life all sorts of strange creatures who began scurrying around the house causing trouble. It also brought to life a household fridge magnet, called Mag Kid! As Mag Kid, it's your job to stop these strange creatures and help the people living in the house.

Slide Adventure: Mag Kid is an action game for the Nintendo DS that comes bundled with a special peripheral. The peripheral plugs into the bottom of the player's DS and acts like a stand, but it also contains a sensor similar to that of an optical mouse. Players control Mag Kid by sliding their DS around along any flat surface.

Mag Kid can't actually move very far on his own - he's limited to sliding around flat surfaces such as tables. Players need to guide him into other objects - such as books and pencil cases - to get him transported to other areas of the house. Mag Kid can ram into enemies - when he does this, they connect onto him and he absorbs their powers such as spears and bubbles (which can be fired using the A Button). Mag Kid can even connect up multiple enemies to himself - but as he does, the magnetic link gets weaker and it's more likely to break apart.
