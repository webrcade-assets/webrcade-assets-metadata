Hakuouki: Yuugi Roku DS is an Adventure game, developed and published by Idea Factory, which was released in Japan in 2011.

Chizuru (Main Character, name change possible) notices that the members of Shinsengumi are secretly having a meeting and so Hijikata tells her to report to him if she finds out anything. She overhears Itou talking about how he lost something precious and that he has to find it before it falls in the other members' hands. When Chizuru finds and opens the box that Itou lost, suddenly everyone goes into chibi mode and now Chizuru (and your dude of choice) have to figure out a way to return back to normal. The challenge is, you must successfully pass a bunch of mini games to get to the bottom of things!
