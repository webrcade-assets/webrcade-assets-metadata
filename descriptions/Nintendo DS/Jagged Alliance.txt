Jagged Alliance is a turn-based tactical combat game with a mixture of strategy, reminiscent of X-Com games. The game differs in many ways from the original DOS version. Graphics have a smaller scale and a very different texture on the sector maps. There are completely new music tracks and improved cinematic cutscenes. Features removed include item repairs, item conditions, bandage points, moving backwards, door manipulation closeups and deadly eels in the water.
