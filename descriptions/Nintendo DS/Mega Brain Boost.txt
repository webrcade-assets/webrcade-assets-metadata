Now you can boost your brain power with 3 full games on 1 cartridge! The brain produces five wavelengths: alpha, beta, delta, gamma and theta waves. Brain Boost Gamma Wave and Brain Boost Beta Wave are individual games designed to develop the right brain by increasing your recognition of images/shapes/spatial patterns, illustrations and intuition. In Mega Brain Boost, you’ll get both of these previously released titles, plus a third entirely new game! All three games utilize Makoto Shichida’s “right brain development theory” to train your brain.
