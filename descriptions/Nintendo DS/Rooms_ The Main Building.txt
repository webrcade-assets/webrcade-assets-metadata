In each room, players must use intellect, strategy and various objects to their full advantage. To escape, rooms can be moved around and matched up with subsequent rooms. The game features a guide named Mr. Book that gives tips on how to move rooms and use various tricks during the adventure. Players are also rewarded with a bonus if the background is placed correctly like in a jigsaw puzzle. With more than 100 rooms to go through and a level editor to create more, this charmed adventure can continue for ages to come.
