A Puzzling Experience for a Relaxing Life



Focusing on the smart gameplay of the mature puzzle audience, each puzzle in NEVES features seven blocks that must be aligned to match a corresponding silhouette. Shapes can range from simple items like a key or a chair to more complicated objects such as an airplane. With the controls of the Nintendo DS it's easy to position the pieces; solving the puzzle can be anything but.
