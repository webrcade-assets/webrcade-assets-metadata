Let the Digimon battle commence all over the world!

More than 250 Digimon are at your command. As the latest and most advanced game based on the popular Digimon brand, Digimon World DS lets you assume a role of Digimon tamer and embark on an exciting journey to discover, tame, raise, train and command Digimon.

Unlike many of the character collection driven games in the past, the true fun of Digimon World DS begins when collection is completed. You will be able to build Digi-Farms to raise, evolve and communicate with your Digimons. You will also be able to exchange Digimons, engage in battles and create rare kinds of Digimon with your friends via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and local DS wireless connection. This is the evolution of Digimon games.
