What is Brain Age? 
Brain Age acts like a treadmill for the mind! Brain Age 2: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day for Nintendo DS is a fun, rewarding game that helps you flex your mental muscles with quick activities that help keep your brain in shape. Brain Age is inspired by the research of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, a prominent Japanese neuroscientist. His studies evaluated the impact of performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate the brain.

On your first day of exercise, you will take a series of tests and get a score that determines how old your brain is. This number is called your DS Brain Age. Perform daily exercises just minutes a day over weeks and months to get better at the exercises and lower your DS Brain Age!
