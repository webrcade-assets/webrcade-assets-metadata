Saihai no Yukue (采配のゆくえ) is a strategy adventure game for the Nintendo DS. The game's setting is in the Warring States period in Japan with the main focus of the game being Sekigahara. The player is Mitsunari Ishida and he needs to monitor the activities of his army, issuing orders to his units and drilling them to test their loyalty. It plays in a similar manner as Capcom's Ace Attorney series. Aside from the different genre style, the setting in this game is cartoony and brighter than the Samurai Warriors series.

A rough translation of the title could either be "Onwards to Order" or "The Saihai's Whereabouts". The saihai is a tool used by war commanders while shouting out orders, but the word is also used as a pun for command or orders (i.e.: "Saihai wo toru" is a Japanese phrase which can mean "Take command"). It's also the object that Mitsunari carries in the game.

The people who developed this game also developed the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. The director is the producer from Dynasty Warriors 6 and the scenario writer previously worked on Dynasty Warriors 5 and Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War.
