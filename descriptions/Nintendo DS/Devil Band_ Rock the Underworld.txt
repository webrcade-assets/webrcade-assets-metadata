Millions of demons and monsters emerge from the earth, destroying everything in their wake. Xavier, the most popular (and most evil) Death Metal rock band in the world, could be the only hope for mankind - or the only nightmare for the devils!

As the most evil force in the universe, you must find your way into hell, defeat the minions of evil and prove you are the true lord of all evil! You have to defeat waves of monsters in each stage: they will become stronger, but you can collect fanatic energy to summon or enhance your fans, or buy powerful musical equipment for the band. Build your own dark army and destroy them all!
