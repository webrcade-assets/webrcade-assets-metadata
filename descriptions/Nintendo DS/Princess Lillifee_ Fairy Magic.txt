The magical world of Lillifee is now reaching children on Nintendo DS. Lillifee's fairy magic uses the possibilities of the Nintendo DS to suit the target group: games on both screens, simple navigation with the stylus and simple voice input will delight Lillifee fans big and small.

Come to Princess Lillifee's Castle Garden! A beautiful, enchanting world awaits you, full of magic, fun and funny games! Make up and decorate the little princess, choose music and dance steps, try on hats, shoes and dresses...

The children can:
• Make Lillifee dance
• Dress up Lillifee
• Make up Lillifee
• Paint with Lillifee
• Breed butterflies with Lillifee
• Play lots of little mini-games like find pearls, find pairs and others.

Thanks to the consistent voice output, Princess Lillifee: Fairy Magic is also ideal for non-readers.
