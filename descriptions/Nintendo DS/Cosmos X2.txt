Pilot the Cosmos X2 to defend your planet against the alien invasion. Battle your way through the solar system to the alien home world to defeat their army. Equip your ship with two weapons of your choice and switch between them at any time during battle. Your active weapon takes damage when your ship gets hit. Defeating enemies regenerates energy in your inactive weapon. The key to your survival lies in finding a balance in your weapon usage.

Battle your way through six levels of action. Three difficulty levels will test your skills. Three bonus modes provide additional challenges.
