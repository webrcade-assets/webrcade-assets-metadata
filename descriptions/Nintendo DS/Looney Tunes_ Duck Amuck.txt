Duck Amuck



Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck lets players wield the Nintendo DS stylus to irritate, aggravate and infuriate their own Daffy Duck in humorous ways. In the game inspired by the classic Duck Amuck cartoon, players will compete against Daffy through a series of mini-games that range from retro inspired favorites to modern, innovative gameplay interactions, with the goal of driving Daffy's temperature, and his temper, through the roof. Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck will also feature wireless game play allowing players to not only gang up on Daffy as a team but also battle each other in head-to-head competition.

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer-drive Daffy nuts anytime, anywhere in the only game where you actually interact with the one-and-only Daffy Duck.

Daffy's goal is to outdo you. It's your job to outdo the Duck-use your stylus to trick, taunt and tease Daffy until you send his temperature meter through the roof.

Engage your friends in outrageous Duck wars through Nintendo Wii and DS connectivity.

Be despicable! Progress through a huge variety of mini games ranging from retro favorites to all-new experiences. As you do better, he gets madder until he can't take it anymore!

A completely original gaming experience custom made for the DS and the Daffy Duck character! Where previous handheld character interaction games have focused on care-giving, Duck Amuck plays like an interactive cartoon.
