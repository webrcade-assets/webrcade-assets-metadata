Baby wild cats can only be kept in the wild or in the zoo? Until now! With Baby Wildcats, young players can nurture, care for and spoil their very own sweet wildcat on the Nintendo DS. After choosing from eight different species - tiger, lion, panther, cheetah, puma, jaguar, white tiger and lion - players spend the whole day together with their darling: the little wild cat climbs trees, plays with balls of yarn in the garden, it being cuddled or romping around with toys.

With the DS microphone, both listen to the radio or exciting bedtime stories. And if the kitten can't fall asleep, the players simply sing him a lullaby. Depending on how trusting it is, it can even learn fun tricks in the fitness room. But the little wildcat also needs attention and affection in other areas: great all-round care with a shower, hair dryer, grooming and of course a wildcat toilet in the bathroom, feeding in the kitchen, choosing suitable clothing, taking care of small ailments or gifts such as a new toy mouse for a birthday and room decorations. Fun with the cute baby wild cats is guaranteed!
