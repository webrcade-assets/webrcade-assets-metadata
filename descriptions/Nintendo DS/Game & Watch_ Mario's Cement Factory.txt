Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes. And no Game & Watch title would be complete without the ‘Watch’ function - each title includes a fully functional clock. In Mario’s Cement Factory, your job is to keep the factory going. Move Mario around the platforms and elevators, pull the levers to drop cement into containers, and fill up the trucks waiting to make their deliveries. Just like other Game & Watch titles, Game B mode is the tougher challenge; with faster, randomly moving platforms.
