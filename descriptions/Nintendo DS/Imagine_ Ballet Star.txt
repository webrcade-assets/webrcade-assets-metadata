Ballet Star begins by allowing players to choose between three female characters each with their own unique personalities and dancing specialties. All three characters offer their own narrative arc, a feature that gives the game a moderate amount of replay value even if the game actually plays the same way no matter which character you choose. The ultimate goal for each of the three girls is simple, to become a professional ballerina by upgrading skills and competing in various ballet rehearsals and recitals every month.
