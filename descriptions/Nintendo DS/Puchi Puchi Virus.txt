Puchi Puchi Virus (ぷちぷちウイルス puchipuchi uirusu) is a video game developed by Nippon Ichi which was released in Japan on July 5, 2007 and in North America on May 19, 2009.

In the game, a planet much like Earth has been affected by a horrible viral outbreak. Anybody infected turns into a weird monster with a pun for a name, such as the Flying Panduh, a panda with a jetpack, a frying pan and an aversion to country music. As the outbreak worsens, Dr. Kevin and his two assistants decide to take a stand against the disease using their newly invented vaccine.
