Command your fleet to victory in this epic battle on the open seas!

Hidden in the untamed ocean lies an enemy ready to attack. Launch strikes and counter-strikes with missiles and powerful torpedoes to locate and submerge your enemy’s entire fleet in this new rendition of the classic paper-and-pencil game, Battleship.

Use additional content such as scanners to gain intelligence and detect the location of your enemy. Challenge your friends to battles against your fleet to see who really rules the seas with local wireless play. You can also tackle missions and battles on your own in three different single-player modes. Your only hope of survival is to uncover your enemy’s whereabouts before they uncover yours!
