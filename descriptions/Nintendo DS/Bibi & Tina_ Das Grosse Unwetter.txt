A storm has broken over the Martinshof
A powerful duo!
Bibi and Tina, two cheerful, open-minded teenagers with wit, heart and mind, are inseparable friends and enthusiastic horseback riders. Her biggest passion is going on adventures with her horses. The clever witch Bibi Blocksberg is a little daredevil, especially when it comes to taking action against injustice.

Tina is more level-headed and prudent, but likes to be carried away by the impulsive Bibi. The stories of their friendship gain a special attraction through Bibi's witchcraft. However, Bibi does not use her witchcraft for everyday problems and conflicts, but only in emergencies - although she sometimes interprets the term "emergency" somewhat liberally.

Bibi visits Tina at the Martinshof as often as possible during the holidays and at weekends. Here the two help Tina's mother with her work on the riding stables. But there is also time for her favorite pastimes: taking care of the animals and riding races with each other. There is often a third party in the group: Alexander von Falkenstein, son of a count and Tina's friend.

Bibi and Tina have to catch a runaway horse
The stories of Bibi and Tina take place on a horse farm and in its rural surroundings. There is everything here that teenagers dream of: horses, horseback riding, falling in love for the first time and a count's castle. Bibi's witchcraft gives the stories a fantastic touch. But even without witchcraft, the daily life of Bibi and Tina is full of fantasy and a never-ending adventure.
