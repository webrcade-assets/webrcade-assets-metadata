Another game in the Ubisoft's Imagine series of games that show female children and early teenagers the basics of some of the professions culturally assigned to women. This time the player assumes the role of a veterinarian and director of a veterinary hospital. You have the responsibility to diagnose and cure the animals that visit your hospital, but you can also play with them if you prefer. As a hospital director you can decide on things like who to hire or what equipment to buy, and even interact with the pet owners and their families. In addition, Animal Doctor can communicate with Petz HorseZ 2 and import horses to cure and train from this game.
