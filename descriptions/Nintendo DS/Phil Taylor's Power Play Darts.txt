Welcome to the wacky world of Phil Taylor’s Power Play Darts.

“THE ONLY OFFICIAL PHIL TAYLOR LICENSED VIDEO GAME”

If you follow a career you’ll encounter Phil’s crazy home town, where you can play 10 different pub darts games, from Around the Clock to Countdown, Golf and Warfare, and visit the travelling Carnival and its games of Balloon Pop, Duck Shoot and Target Practice. You can also earn points to enable you to take part in tournaments against a variety of loony characters, ultimately aiming to knock Phil off the top spot at the Las Vegas Masters. If you just want a quick game, you can play alone or against friends in Multiplayer mode.
