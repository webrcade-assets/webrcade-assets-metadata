Spanish for Everyone! is an educational language learning game in which the player takes the role of a boy named Shawn. The game starts out when Shawn loans his brother's Nintendo DS to a boy named Miguel. Shortly after, Miguel's father hurriedly pulls up in a limo and tells Miguel to hop in, leaving Shawn DS-less as the car speeds away with the police in hot pursuit. Now with the help of his Aunt Gina and other odd characters, Shawn is on a quest to Mexico to retrieve the game system and learn basic Spanish.

The game consists of three minigames: Hangman, a word search, and a card-flipping memory game. In order to move on to the next part of the story, the player needs to score a specified amount of points in these games, and then complete a "test" in which all three games are played back-to-back under a time limit.
