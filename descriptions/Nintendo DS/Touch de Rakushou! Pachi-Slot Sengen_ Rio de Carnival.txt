Touch de Rakush≈ç! Pachi-Slot Sengen is one of the many releases in Tecmo and NET's pachi-slot simulation series, and the first to appear on the Nintendo DS. It features a digital reproduction of the Rio de Carnival pachi-slot machine. The machine is faithfully reproduced, allowing the player to practice techniques for real-life play. In addition to standard play, there are a variety of settings to tweak, as well as multiple different practice modes.

As usual, the Rio Gallery mode features many unlockable illustrations, and there are also three different minigames, including a spot-the-difference game and a blackjack game.
