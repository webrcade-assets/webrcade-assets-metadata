Based on the long-running game show The Price is Right, the 2010 edition allows players to hit all the highlights from the show - bidding on Contestant's Row, playing one of 30 pricing games, spinning the giant wheel, and hopefully participating in the Showcase.

Single player has two modes. "Classic" simply takes you through a single episode of the show as a contestant. "Three Strikes" has you keep playing as a contestant until you lose at Contestant's Row three times. Win or lose at the Row, you'll still play a pricing game after, and try to rack up the most money before you get your three strikes.

The Wii version offers a "Party Mode" where up to four players start initially, and any available human (or computer) players swap in as a player leaves Contestant's Row. Multiplayer is not available on the DS, and is planned to be added as an Internet-based "Price is Right Live" for the PC.

Winning pricing games in single player unlocks that game to be available to play at any time from the main menu. You also unlock new clothing and hairstyles for your avatar. The Wii and PC versions further unlock video clips of humorous moments from the show.
