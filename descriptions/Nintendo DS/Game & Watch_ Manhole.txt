Manhole is a DSiWare game based on the Game & Watch LCD toy of the same name. All of the manhole covers are missing along the footpaths in the street, and it's up to you to cover them up as people walk across so that they don't fall into the sewer below.

You score a point for each person that you prevent from falling, and each person that falls scores you a miss. When you have three misses, the game is over. If you reach 300 points, all of your misses are cleared - if you have no misses, then all of your points are doubled until you do eventually score a miss.
