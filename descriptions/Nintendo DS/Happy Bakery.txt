Deep in the forest there was a pretty little bakery with a bright red roof. The name of the shop was Happy Bakery.

The baker was a pretty little girl called Rue, with such a passion for bread that even her hair looked like a fluffy bread roll! But Rue has been finding it hard to manage the shop all by herself, so recently she's decided she needs a helping hand.

"If only there was someone who loved bread as much as me..."

Today is another day that finds Rue behind the counter, resting her head on her hands as she waits for a budding assistant.
