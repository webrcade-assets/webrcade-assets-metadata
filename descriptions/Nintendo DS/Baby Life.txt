In the game, players take control of their personal babies. from age 9 to 15 months. They teach the baby speech, movement, and behaviour. Over 100 clothing items can be accessed, either to use or to trade over Wi-Fi. The game utilises NDS features such as the speech system and the stylus. Emmanuel Drouin, managing director of Game Life, said that the game allows players to interact with the "most lovely hero you can have in a videogame: a baby".
