This English course can be used by kids who are 3 years of age or older. Do you think it’s too early for a kindergarten child to face a real English course? Your children in elementary school are very busy between after-school, sports, music and extracurricular commitments and they often arrive home very tired so at the end of the day they will not be able to concentrate on an English lesson…but this is different! Do you want to brush up boring grammar rules learned in the classroom in a fun way? You’re in high school and you’re lazy but you need to go over the basic rules of grammar and you want to consolidate your knowledge in English? If you want to improve your English level while having fun, this game is perfect for you!
