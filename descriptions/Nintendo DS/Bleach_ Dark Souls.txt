Bleach: The Blade of Fate is a 2D fighting game. It is an English localization of the Japanese release Bleach DS: Souten ni Kakeru Unmei. The game is based on the Shounen Jump manga/anime Bleach, and many characters from the series are playable.

The action takes place on 2 planes on which the characters can move, and special moves are available when the stamina and spirit energy gauges fill up. Another gameplay element involves cards. The player builds a deck, and can use cards during battle. These cards can augment player stats or decrease the opponent's, and can be selected and used via the DS touch screen.

Four people can connect and play against each other over Nintendo's WiFi connection. Aside from the multiplayer, there are different game modes available: story, arcade, VS, training, challenge, and survival.
