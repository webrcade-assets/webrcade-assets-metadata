The game has three acts, divided in 40 missions. You'll have to race, crash the cars, escape from the villains, find hidden rocks, transport goods, mow the lawn, etc. Throughout the course of the game, you can unlock rewards and gain achievements by completing missions in a set amount of time or without breaking the car, finding all the secret comic pages, performing jumps through billboards, etc.
