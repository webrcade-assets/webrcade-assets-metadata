Zoids Saga DS: Legend of Arcadia is the conclusion of the Zoids Saga series. It comprises scenes from Zoids Saga, Zoids Saga II (released in the west as Zoids: Legacy) and Zoids Saga III: Fuzors. It features upgraded graphics and sound. Additionally, Zoids and story elements from the Zoids Genesis anime have been included.

The game plays like a traditional JRPG with the player controlling characters and mechs from the Zoids titles. Enemy Zoids wander around the overworld and chase you on sight, which takes the player into the turn based combat system. Strong Japanese knowledge is required, as there is no known official patch or English translation.
