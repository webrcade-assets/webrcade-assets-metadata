Flower Sun and Rain: Murder and Mystery in Paradise is an adventure game from Goichi Suda (or Suda51), who is best known as the lead designer of cult video games Killer 7 and No More Heroes.

In the game you play as Sumio Mondo, a "searcher" whose job is to search for people's missing items. After failing to defuse a bomb set on an aeroplane, Sumio begins to relive the same day over and over again, and the same disaster continuously takes place.

The game is played by exploring 3D environments and searching for places, people and objects to examine. Once Sumio discovers a place he can examine, he uses his partner, "Catherine" â€” a briefcase that can jack into anything and discover secrets. After finding the correct jack to hook up to the object with, Sumio must input a code to unlock the secret and solve the puzzle. Sometimes this is guesswork, sometimes hints are given from other parts of the game.
