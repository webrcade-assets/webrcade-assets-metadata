The battlefield is calling!

In Artillery: Knights vs. Orcs, the knights and orcs fight from a distance with powerful cannons. Choose a team and, utilising your full arsenal, bombard your opponent. Adjust the fire power and angle of your cannon, and don't forget to keep an eye on the wind direction and strength.
