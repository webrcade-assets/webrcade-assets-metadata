Inugamike no Ichizoku (犬神家の一族) is a detective visual novel based on the novel by Seishi Yokomizo (横溝 正史) first released in 1950 which was also adapted to a movie, twice, first in 1976, then again in 2006. The game uses a monochromatic ink painting style for characters and locations alike, which gives it a unique look and atmosphere. The story has variations and alterations so even people who read the original work will not go through just a visual and less lengthy representation of a book. The player is cast in a role of Kousuke Kandaichi (金田一 耕助), a fictional Japanese detective (like Sherlock Holmes or Conan Edogawa) who is on a trail of a serial killer. The game allows story branching based on player's choices which can make the story deviate from that in the original mystery novel.
