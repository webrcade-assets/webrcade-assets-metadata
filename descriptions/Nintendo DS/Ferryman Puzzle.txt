Jiang is one of the best ferrymen in the world and transports everything across the river. Master Fu has offered him a large sum of money to transport all his wares to the other side of the river. This is a puzzling problem, since there are wolves and sheep amongst his goods - and the wolves love to eat sheep. Can you help Jiang to get everything across safely?
