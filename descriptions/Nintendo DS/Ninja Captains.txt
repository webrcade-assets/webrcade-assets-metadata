Initially the games must be played through in linear fashion via the "story mode" in which the Ninja Captains are revealed to be some sort of inept crime fighters. Seeing a giant robot mouse trashing downtown New York on the television the kitty foursome follow a gizmo that's supposed to point them to where the trouble is, but it's malfunctioning so they take a taxi straight past the monster and board a plane instead. Thus begins a series of air, land and sea journeys that come full circle right back to New York for a final mini-game through the inside of the robot to save the day.
