The miniature wonderland of Sunny Patch is filled with bugs of all shapes, sizes and colors. Here lives the kind-hearted Miss Spider, her husband Holley and their buggy bunch of kids. Near the end of autumn, the bugs in Sunny Patch have to stock up for the winter and so Miss Spider's children Dragon, Bounce, Squirt, Wiggle and Shimmer help out by collecting fruit and berries for the cold season ahead.

Enjoy playing through 24 different levels which are divided between the key characters from the show, so each level is centered around one of Miss Spider's kids. To complete a level the player must help one of the children collect enough fruit and berries to fill up the Fruit-O-Meter and avoid tricky obstacles along the way by using their unique skills
