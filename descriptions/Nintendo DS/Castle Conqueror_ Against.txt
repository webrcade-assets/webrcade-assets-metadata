The god of the island bestows his blessing upon you, and you have his power to curse the invaders and save your tribe.

You are a great warrior from an ancient tribe on the island. Your island is a beautiful place where you worship the god of the island and he grants you and your tribe the powers that the island can bestow. The Empire suddenly arrived from the other side of the ocean, found gold mines and hunted down many innocent people; the fear of the Empire even made some tribes betray their faith. This has incurred the wrath of your god, and you must leave the safety of your hut to curse and punish the invaders.
