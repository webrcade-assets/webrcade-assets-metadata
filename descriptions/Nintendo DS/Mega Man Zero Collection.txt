The Mega Man Zero series is comprised of all four Mega Man Zero titles previously released on the GameBoy Advance onto one cartridge for the Nintendo DS. In the tradition of most Mega Man games, the Mega Man Zero Collection is a fast-paced, 2D action side-scrolling platform game. For the first time, it will be available for Nintendo DS complete with all new modes.

First launched on the GameBoy Advance in 2002, the Mega Man Zero series follows Zero, originally introduced in Mega Man X. Players will be able to use Zero’s arsenal of weapons which include his Z-Saber and Buster Shot. Also adding new flavor to the series are the additions of devices such as the Chain Rod and Zero Knuckle, giving Zero the advantage.

The series begins with our hero waking up 100 years after the events of Mega Man X. Zero finds himself in a world where innocent reploids (robots) are being hunted down by the government of “Neo Arcadia.” A resistance group finds our hero and asks Zero to fight alongside them against the evil regime. The series follows Zero on his adventures as he battles the government of Neo Arcadia and his fight for peace!
