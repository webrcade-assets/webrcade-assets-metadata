Prepare for a trip to the murky depths of the ocean with Aquia, a game in the Art Style series. In this game, you must assist a diver as he swims down further and further into the ocean. To do this, match three of the same colored blocks either horizontally or vertically, and he will descend a little. You add new blocks by scrolling your currently held blocks up and down to the desired position in the playfield, and then pressing A to push them into place (which pushes blocks out the other side). If you cause multiple blocks to clear by clearing one set of blocks and then having more blocks fall and clear, the diver will dive further.

There are two different modes of play:
Timed Dive - In this mode, you clear blocks until you reach the end of the level.
Free Dive - This mode continues forever - continue clearing blocks as long as you can.
Progressing through the game unlocks different creatures to view in the Aquarium. There are a total of 22 different sea creatures to unlock and view.
