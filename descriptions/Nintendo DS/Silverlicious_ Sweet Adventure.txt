Following the enchanting storyline of Silverlicious written and illustrated by Victoria Kann, Silverlicious the game lets players set out on an adventure as Pinkalicious who has lost her ability to taste anything sweet. Help Pinkalicious regain her sweet tooth as you practice kindness, good manners and helping others in need. Collect costumes and accessories you can use to dress up Pinkalicious and unlock magical rewards including butterflies, sparkle rides and fireworks as you explore the beautiful lands and meet new friends. Boost your “sweet meter” with every good deed and polite remark and you’ll quickly discover that true sweetness comes from much more than cupcakes and cookies
