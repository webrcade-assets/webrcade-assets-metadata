"Powder" is a homebrew roguelike role-playing game developed by Jeff Lait for the Game Boy Advanced. It was later ported to the Nintendo DS.

Descend into the depths of the dungeon until you reach the foul daemon known as  Baezl'bub. When you have slain Baezl'bub in heroic combat, or, if Baezl'bub dies in any way, retrieve his black heart and bring it to the surface world.

Explore endless labyrinths crawling with unimaginable evils and brimming with magnificent treasure. No two visits to the underworld are ever the same, as the dungeon layouts change every time you plumb the depths.
