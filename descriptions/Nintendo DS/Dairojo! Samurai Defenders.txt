Defend the castles of Japan with your samurai army!

On the awakening of the Edo period, Shoguns fight ferocious battles to win over the Land of the Rising Sun. From Kumamoto to Tsuruga, six emblematic castles are under siege by implacable ninjas attacking from land and air. Position your spears, archers, gunners, generals and cannons strategically. Promote their ranks and wisely employ the smoke bombs and rice balls to your advantage. But never get too confident as the art of war of Hana, the Geisha, is a good example on how appearances can be deceptive.
