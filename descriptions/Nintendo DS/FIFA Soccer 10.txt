FIFA Soccer 10 is the fifth game of the series for the Nintendo DS. As always, the player can choose to play with many teams from many different licensed leagues, as well as many national teams in different game modes such as the classic exhibition match, tournaments, manager mode or the recent "be a pro" mode.

In this game the player can take control of his/her favourite team, change lineups, establish tactics and give orders to the team by tapping the screen with your stylus or just play the match and leave the decisions to the second coach.

It's also possible to create a player and see how he gains experience in every match playing in any desired team. Experience points can be given according to the position that the player's going to play in the hope of making him the best player out there.
