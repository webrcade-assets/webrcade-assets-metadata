Wicked ghosts have kidnapped the presidentâ€™s daughter, trapping her in a haunted mansion! As a plucky young bird trooper you must use your bomb-throwing abilities to defeat the ghosts and rescue the girl. Ghosts can only be destroyed by throwing bombs into their mouths. Use the stylus to set your throwing angle and take your best shot! Bounce bombs off walls and eerie floating furniture to defeat all the spooks in each stage, but make sure not to run out of bombs or you're in for a fright! In addition to the main Story Mode, you can really put your skills to the test in Challenge Mode with only a limited number of bombs to last you through to the end. But never fear; with perseverance and accuracy, you're sure to replenish your supply and stay in high spirits!
