Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. Tetra falls into danger when she explores an abandoned ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by a fairy who agrees to help him as he sets off to find Tetra - and his way back to the seas he once knew.
