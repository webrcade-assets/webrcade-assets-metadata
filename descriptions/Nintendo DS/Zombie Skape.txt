Ethan was skateboarding in the park as usual. He practised a lot every evening. His dream was to become number one, and imitate his great idol Johnny Eagle, the best skater of all time.

One night, as he practised, something strange was happening... Without knowing why, Ethan was surrounded by lots of zombies. It was a nightmare. Now he will have to put everything he has learned through skateboarding into practice to survive.
