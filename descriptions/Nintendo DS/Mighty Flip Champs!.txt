Take control of multiple dimensions as Alta in Mighty Flip Champs! Navigate your way through different worlds and dimensions as you attempt to make your way to the exit. Use your Magical Warp Wand to switch to new dimensions, but watch the touch screen when you flip to a new dimension - or you might just get crushed!

Mighty Flip Champs! is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DSi that uses both the top screen and the touch screen for play. The player controls Alta on the top screen, and the next dimension in the sequence is displayed on the touch screen. As Alta, the player is unable to jump - pressing A, B, X or Y instead uses the Warp Wand, which flips the dimension from the touch screen up onto the top screen. This allows you to progress forward by creating paths where there would otherwise be dead ends. However, it can also be dangerous if used recklessly, as you can crush Alta in a wall or make her fall straight onto spikes. At certain points in the game, the Warp Wand also malfunctions, and automatically flips to new dimensions after set periods of time. In these situations, you need to stay on your toes and react quickly to the level changes.

Mighty Flip Champs! DX is slightly altered to accommodate the platforms it is played on. As there is only one screen, the current dimension is displayed on the left of the screen, while the next dimension is displayed on the right of the screen, mirrored horizontally rather than vertically.
