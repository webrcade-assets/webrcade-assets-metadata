Can Justus, Peter and Bob solve the mystery of the mysterious treasure chest and the lost Chinese "Book of Changes"? The new The Three ??? game on Nintendo DS offers a classic adventure with many missions, puzzles and challenging detective work. In various mini-games, the player helps the three friends to look for treasures with the metal detector, to sift through old attics for clues, to create identikit images or to hunt down Victor Hugenay. Solving the mystery requires detective skills and logic, but also the ability to react. Knowledge of previous cases involving the three friends is very helpful in solving the case, but a carefully compiled index card archive in the head office also makes the research work easier for the The Three ??? newcomers. The exciting detective story has been specially conceived from scratch and has never appeared in any Die Drei ??? radio play or book.
