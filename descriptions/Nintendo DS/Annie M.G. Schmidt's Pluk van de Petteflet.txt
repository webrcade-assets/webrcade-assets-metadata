Pluk van de Petteflet is a Dutch educational game for children aged three to seven, developed as a tie-in with the 2004 movie Pluk van de Petteflet. 

Both the movie and the game are based on the 1971 children's book of the same name that is about the boy Pluk who drives a red crane car through town looking for a house to live. The dove Dolly tells him there is an empty room in the top floor of the Petteflet, a large skyscraper. There, he gets involved in adventures with the other inhabitants and the surroundings of the building.

The gameplay consists of nine mini-games aimed for children, ranging from coloring book to  a memory game.
