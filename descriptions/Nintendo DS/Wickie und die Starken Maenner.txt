Wickie is a young Viking boy of about 10 years of age. He is more clever and sharp-witted than anyone else in his home village of Flake and thus often saves the day. In this game the men of Flake have been captured while on a mission; once again it is up to Wickie to come up with a rescue plan. The game is a classic platform game. Wickie carries a slingshot, but that is not enough to defeat the more powerful enemies. Instead, he must rely on tricks and traps such as pushing boulders towards enemy patrols. There are five different game worlds that lead Wickie into different corners of Europe. Short cut scenes with the characters from the animated series tell the story in-between the levels. There are also some very simple mini games such as lock picking or connect the numbers.
