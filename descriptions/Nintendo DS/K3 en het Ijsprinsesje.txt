Help the girls of K3 during their visit to fairyland!

Go catch frogs in the enchanted forest and try to remember how they croak,
make different kinds of candies under the watchful eye of the evil witch and then free the K3s from the gingerbread house as quickly as possible, catch musical notes in the house of the Wizard Without a Name,? Are you ready to dance at King Flurkentijn's party? Not quite yet! Go to the K3 design center and design the most beautiful dresses for Karen, Kristel and Katleen. What's wrong with Karen, Kristel and Kathleen's dresses? Find the right gems and put them back in the right order on the girls' dresses.
Have fun in Fairyland!
