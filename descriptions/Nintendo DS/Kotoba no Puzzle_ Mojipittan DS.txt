Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan[a] is a series of Japanese word puzzle video games developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, formerly Namco. The series began in arcades with Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan in 2001, and has seen multiple sequels for several platforms, including the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. Gameplay is similar to Scrabble â€” players are tasked with using Hiragana to form words on a board by placing down pieces marked with Hiragana characters.

The original Kotoba no Puzzle was designed by Hiroyuki Goto, who is well known in Japan for being able to recite pi from memory to 42,195 decimal places, making him the world record holder at the time. Likely due to its strong usage of Japanese, the series has remained confined to Japan. The Kotoba no Puzzle series was met with positive reviews from critics, being praised for its originality, multiplayer and addictive gameplay, with Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan DS receiving the "Gold Hall of Fame" award from Famitsu.
