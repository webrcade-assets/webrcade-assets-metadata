The story begins in a very different region of Unova or Unova although it is still very similar to that of the original games such as Pokémon White 2 and Black 2 but with greater difficulty, new events, the possibility of catching all existing legendary up to fifth generation, new secret locations to catch Legendary Pokémon and many more news to discover.  In addition, the adventure is a great challenge since along the way the difficulty of the game increases considerably.  Therefore, this time we have the Unova region in its purest form where only the best Pokémon Masters will be able to defeat Team Plasma, win the 8 gym medals, defeat the high command and the champion of the Pokémon League.  This great challenge begins now!
