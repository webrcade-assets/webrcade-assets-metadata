Doodle Hex has been created specifically for the DS format, and makes innovative use of the handheld's touch screen abilities within a clever spell-casting scenario. Players - nicknamed 'Doodlers' - are enrolled within a special College of Runes, wherein they are charged with learning the intricacies of rune-casting and their use within elemental magic. However, the tedium of college life is regularly interrupted by the school ghost, Kalamazoo, who organizes battles between the students as a way to further test their rune knowledge and casting skills.
