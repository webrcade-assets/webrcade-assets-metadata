Run, jump and towel-attack to collect apples and successfully bypass the legions bent on Chimaki’s destruction.

Chimaki from Guilty Gear 2 stars in this quirky platformer for the Nintendo DSiWare service. Chimaki is a tiny creature with an insatiable lust for life. Something of a recluse, he ventures out of his hermitage on occasion to seek the truth. What goes on behind that implacable face is a mystery – perhaps even to Chimaki himself. Make use of Chimaki’s run, jump and towel attacks to collect apples, successfully bypass the legions bent on his destruction and reach the hot spring located at the end of each stage. Chimaki is a lover, not a fighter. As such, a mere two hits will cause him to expire.
