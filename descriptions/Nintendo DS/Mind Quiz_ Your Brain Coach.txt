Mind Quiz is designed to improve your brainpower in five key areas: Verbal, Numeric, Spatial, Memory, and Logic. There are multiple exercises in each area, including Anagrams, Mental Arithmetic, Fold the Cube, Matching Pairs, and Sudoku. (15 total exercises.) These can be practiced at any time, at one of five difficulty levels. Once a day, you can take a Daily Brain Test, which will test you in these five areas. A progress chart is included to show your progress, and high scores are kept for each exercise and difficulty level.
