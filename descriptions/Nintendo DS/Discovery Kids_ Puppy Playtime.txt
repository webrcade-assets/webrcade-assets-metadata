In Puppy Playtime you can raise and train your very own rescue dog! Choose from three different breeds (Dalmatian, German Shepherd and Labrador) and train them in over 30 missions to eventually work alongside teams from the Police Force, Fire Department and Lifeguards. Train your puppies from two months old to one year old and watch them develop into fully-grown rescue dogs.
