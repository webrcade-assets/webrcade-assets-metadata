An action-based DS entry in Sunrise's Harobots series. You roll the Haro characters from Gundam around on a play field, attempting to take out enemies by striking them. Enemies that have been taken out can be tossed at other enemies, resulting in huge explosions. The game includes playable robots from Sunrise animes. When you change robots, you're treated to an animated introduction.
