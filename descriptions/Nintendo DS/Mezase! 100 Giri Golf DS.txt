The Japanese DS's stable of training games increases by one with the October 2008 release of 100 Kiri Golf DS. This interesting piece of software is designed to help the burgeoning golfer improve their gameplay. 

The game boasts three different game modes, each designed to improve your knowledge of the game of golf. There is also a quiz mode and a guide to almost all of Japan's golf courses. The whole package was designed under the guidance of Golf Digest. 

The one thing that is not included in this game is an actual golf game. Very important if you are considering importing this one: This is not a golf game, it is a guide for improving your real-life golf game.
