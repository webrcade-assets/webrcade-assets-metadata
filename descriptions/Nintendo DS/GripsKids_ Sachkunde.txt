"GripsKids Sachkunde" conveys relevant elementary school content in geography, biology and physics in cool television studios. In the categories "Colors and Sounds", "Experiments", "Plants and Animals", "Human Body" and "The World" children learn with the help of additional explanatory texts in the two studio guides.

In order to offer the right level of difficulty for every age and every level of knowledge, there is the integrated age check: based on the specified birthday, a simple traffic light system indicates tasks that are too difficult. This guarantees that children continue to develop and learn new things. The same applies to the extensive multiplayer: In addition to hotseat, this also offers single-card and multi-card games for learning together with parents and friends.
