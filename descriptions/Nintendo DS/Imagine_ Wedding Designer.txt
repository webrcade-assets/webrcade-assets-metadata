The game portion of Wedding Designer revolves around a string of wedding related decisions leading up to the big ceremony. There are six brides to cater to, each with their own personalities and preferences. The game provides you with a PDA to keep track of this information, but in all honesty none of it is necessary when planning the weddings. As players make their way around town – jumping from locations such as the stationary store, music store and boutique – the bride follows, smiling for decisions she approves of and frowning at those that she doesn't. Once the player realizes this, the challenge disappears immediately. By simply choosing those items the bride smiles at, the perfect wedding is a foregone conclusion.
