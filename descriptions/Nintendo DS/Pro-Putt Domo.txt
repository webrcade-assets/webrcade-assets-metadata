In Pro-Putt Domo, Domo hits the green in an effort to win the world putt-putt golf championship. Domo competes to finish with the lowest number of strokes in either the nine-hole Small Classic or the 18-hole Big Open tournament. Along the way, he'll collect coins and earn bowls of meat-and-potato stew while avoiding bunkers and water hazards.
