Coming from the north, Olaf the Viking's comical horde is set to make waves on your Nintendo DSi!

The Viking drakkars are sailing up the rivers to your castles and it is up to you to construct fortifications so they do not pillage everything you own. But watch out: the more you defend yourself, the greater the waves of Vikings become. Fortunately the experience you gain will help you to build even more powerful defences. Thwart all your assailantâ€™s ruses and unlock new kinds of buildings!

Can you rise to the challenge and prevent Olaf from pillaging all your valuables for his sweetheart Olga?
