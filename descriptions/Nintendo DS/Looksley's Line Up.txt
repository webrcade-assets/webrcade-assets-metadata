In Tales in a Box, discover a new slant on hidden-object games! Via clever use of the Nintendo DSi system’s inner camera, you can peer ‘into’ the screen, tilting your head to view a scene from different angles, creating an impression of real depth. Journey through a fairy-tale world populated by characters from famous folk stories, and search each themed diorama by looking around from all angles to find hidden letters and objects. As you collect letters and objects, you will meet new characters and form words that will open new stages with even more hidden items to find. Some stages contain secret pictures, testing your observation skills even further. Players of all ages will be amazed by this unique visual spectacle, where a simple-looking picture can reveal a whole world of stories, if you just know where to look!
