The second instalment in the series of episodic point-and-click adventure games based on the hit television series House. House, M.D. - Episode 2: Blue Meanie focuses on the story of a chef who suddenly falls ill, and at the same time her skin turns blue. It is up to Dr. House and his crack team of doctors to solve the mystery of their patient’s bizarre illness all the while making many references to The Smurfs and other blue characters from popular culture. As the story unfolds, you will be given the task of gathering information from the patient while treating her illness and testing her symptoms. 
 
Just like the first episode, the entirety of this game is played through a series of mini-games that take place on the DSi’s touch screen. There are a variety of games ranging from hidden object puzzles to operating medical machinery.
