Worms: Open Warfare 2 builds upon the success of last year's Worms: Open Warfare. In addition to the classic Deathmatch mode, the game also includes robust new single and multiplayer modes such as Rope Race, Fort, Puzzle and Campaign modes that challenge players to use new strategies and teamwork to defeat their enemies. The new Firing Range allows gamers to test their weapons skills, including 11 new weapons like the Bunker Buster and Buffalo of Lies as well as classics such as the Super Sheep, Concrete Donkey and the Holy Hand Grenade.
