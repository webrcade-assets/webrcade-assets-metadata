myNotebook: Tan allows you to take notes wherever you are. Just pop open your Nintendo DSi system and jot down your thoughts. Make a list and cross it off, or even play your favorite pen-and-paper games (games not included). You can personalize your notebook by drawing on the cover or by changing the paper type with 24 unlockable squared and lined paper styles. Use the pen or pencil to make notes or doodles and then erase the bits you don't like. With five ink colors, you'll always be able to make your notes and doodles look stylish. myNotebook also includes 128 pages to write on, plus the ability to export your pages to your Nintendo DSi Photo Album.
