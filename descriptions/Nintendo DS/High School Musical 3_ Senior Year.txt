Join the Wildcats in this touch-based music and rhythm game based on the film.

Players play through each of the movie's 11 songs by sweeping a pie-shaped icon into the notes of the music as they stream toward the center of the top screen. As the music picks up, so does the pacing of this game, and players must keep up or risk being unable to progress towards their ultimate goal -- graduation!

Along the way, players are also challenged with various activities, including some different musical minigames, yearbook assembly, and quizzes that test how well their personalities match with the High School Musical characters. Since the game offers both a Junior Varsity and Varsity mode, gamers of all experience levels will be able to play through the game with ease.

The game also features a multiplayer "BFF quiz mode" where players see how well they know each other, a jukebox mode that lets players just listen to unlocked songs, as well as support for Dgamer unlockables, honors, and online chat.
