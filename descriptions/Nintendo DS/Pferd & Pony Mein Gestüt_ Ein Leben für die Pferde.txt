The Riding Stables at the old mill needs a little polishing: The riding hall is run down, thereâ€™s a draught in the stable and nobody wants to live in this shabby guesthouse. The player has to take over and push this place to new glory.

The stable, the riding hall, and the guesthouse are renovated and soon guests are willing to pay for their stay, again. The player uses this money to build a new breeding stable and shortly after foals are frolicking there with their mothers. Later on the player starts training foals on the lunge and may sells them to trustworthy clients. Other horse owners will come to pay for service of massaging stressed horses. The player's own horse is also living there and looks forward to rides through forests, at the beach an over mountain ranges. If the player learned well with his horse in training lessons, he may take part in various cross-country races.
