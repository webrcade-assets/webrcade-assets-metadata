Doraemon: Nobita no Shin Makai Daibouken DS (ドラえもん のび太の新魔界大冒険 DS) is a Nintendo DS card battling game based on the Doraemon: Nobita's New Great Adventure into the Underworld movie. It was published by Sega in Japan.

Frustaded by the multiple problems at school and at home, Nobita wonders if his problems can be solved with magic and asks to Doraemon for the robotic cat's what-if-telephone-booth gadget to go to a parallel world which magic exists.

The game plays similar to Doraemon: Nobita no Kyouryuu 2006 DS, but now it features an (now shutdown) online multiplayer.
