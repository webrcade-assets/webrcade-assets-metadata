Over 1.7 million Japanese travel to Thailand and Indonesia every year on holiday. The language barrier generally presents a problem but thanks to Gakken's Gakken Thai-Indonesia Zanmai DS language learning software, Japanese folks can speak to the locals with basic conversational phrases instead of pointing and gesturing. To help with proper pronunciation, practice samples are included along with a "sound measurement" function which shows the waveform of a spoken word and compares it to a properly spoken example. The software starts beginners at an elementary level and steps up the lessons until a 500-word vocabulary is achieved. A test function allows learners to check their skill level. In addition to learning to speak Thai and the Indonesian language, the software also includes basic reading and writing exercises for Thai (ภาษาไทย) characters.
