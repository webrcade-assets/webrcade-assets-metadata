Secrets of the Titanic 1912 - 2012 is a hidden-object game, and its gameplay ties in very loosely with the subject matter. It would seem that for generations, members of Eva's family have suffered from some undiagnosed condition that makes them all terribly untidy people. Wherever they go — be it their home, car or a luxury passenger liner — it always looks like a grenade has gone off and scattered their belongings all over the place. This conveniently unexplained occurrence provides you with a suitably messy setup in each of the game's stages, and it's up to you to sift through all the clutter and find certain items.
