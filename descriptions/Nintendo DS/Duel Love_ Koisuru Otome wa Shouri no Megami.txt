"Duel Love" (デュエルラブ 恋する乙女は勝利の女神) is a Japanese otome video game for the Nintendo DS, developed and published by Namco Bandai Games. Released on March 13, 2008, the game features character designs and artwork by Hisaya Nakajo. The narrative follows a female protagonist who befriends the male members of her high school's boxing club. It is rated C by the Japanese rating board CERO, indicating suitability for players aged 15 and up.

As a dating simulation game, the primary objective is for the player to form a relationship with one of the male characters. The game includes several minigames where the player assists the young men with their training, cheers them on during matches to influence their performance, treats their injuries, gives them back rubs, and wipes sweat off their chests.

The game garnered some attention from the gaming media due to its suggestive content. Notably, in a minigame where the boys are showering, their bodies are shown nude with the genitals obscured by the gap between the DS screens.
