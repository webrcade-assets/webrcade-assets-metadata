Use the DS stylus to grab panels and slide them left and right. If you match three or more panels of the same color, they will vanish. Form chains and combos to create cascading waterfalls of panels to rack up high scores. The basic game play is similar to the classics Tetris Attack and Pok√©mon Puzzle League, but the touch screen gameplay adds a new dimension of fun, giving Planet Puzzle League a bright new feel.  Released as Puzzle League DS in Europe and Panel de Pon DS in Japan.
