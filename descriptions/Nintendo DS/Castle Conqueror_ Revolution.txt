This is our lovely island, and we will never allow the Empire to ruin it! You are a member of a family of military geniuses who came from the Empire, and have lived on a beautiful island for many years. Then the Empire arrived on the island: they now control everything, and are seeking valuable resources and gold. They have ruined the island's environment and have hunted down and killed the tribal people, some of whom were your friends. You must now stop the Empire and protect your people, by becoming a commander and leading your people against them. This is a revolution for you and the entire island!
