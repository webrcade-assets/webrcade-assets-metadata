The player is taken to Make 10 Kingdom, a land ruled by Numbers, where they are requested by King Decimus to journey to meet with the 9 Make 10 Masters.

Make 10 contains over 30 minigames, for which the rule is always to make multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, and so on. That can be achieved in various ways by using the console's stylus: by covering up some numbers, switching numbers around, writing a number, etc.

The minigames can be accessed through different modes: - Make 10 Kingdom, the story mode where the player journeys through Make 10 Kingdom, meeting the 9 Masters and unlocking minigames as they go. - Trial Mountains, where the player can test their skills at the minigames that have been unlocked - Make 10 Test, where the player can get their Make 10 skills evaluated.

If stuck, the player can use Assist Points that are scattered all around the Kingdom.
