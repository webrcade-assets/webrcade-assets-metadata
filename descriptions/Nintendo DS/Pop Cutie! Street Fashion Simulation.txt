Pop Cutie! Street Fashion Simulation lets the player take control and manage their own fashion boutique, letting them create their own lines of clothes, accessories and even design hair styles, hire models to sell their products, hiring workers for their stores and placing ads on TV and magazines.

Players can also explore and meet friends and random characters to learn about new fashion trends and change accordingly or even meet and hire new potential models. They can also go against fellow fashion rivals in fashion shows where winning these shows will give the player more exposure.

Friends can also go head-to-head in Wireless DS Multi-Card play, facing each other in a "Fashion Battle" to see which clothing line is the best.
