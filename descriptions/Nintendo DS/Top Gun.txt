Top Gun brings the high-spirited, thrill a minute adventure of being a Top Gun pilot to your Nintendo DS -- just like the kind you enjoyed in the hit Tom Cruise movie. You'll fly some of the fastest machines on Earth, in single-player or multiplayer action. While playing, you'll also have to pull off the sort of dangerous deeds you need to accomplish, when you're in the macho, daring world of fighter pilots. Enter as rookie pilots, selected along with a handful of other pilots for elite training at the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School.
