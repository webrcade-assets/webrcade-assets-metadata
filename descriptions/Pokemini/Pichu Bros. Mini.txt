Pichu Bros. mini is a collection of minigames similar to the earlier Pokémon Party mini. This game is based on the Pokémon anime, focusing on the titular Pichu Bros. and the Pichu Posse (a gang that consists of the Pichu Bros. and their friends that they regularly go on adventures with). The games include a skateboarding game where one of the brothers must avoid obstacles, a game where the player shakes the system to help Teddiursa eat big piles of fruit within a time limit, a whack-a-mole game where Smoochum must kiss a Diglett, and a hot air balloon game with Magby.
