In Pokémon Race mini, you control a Pikachu who races other Pokémon. The game is a combination of racing and platforming elements. The race has three laps. You must jump onto higher and lower platforms, as well as climb walls that are too high, and avoid crashing into walls. Every lap, you are given a power-up. Holding the B button charges this, and releasing lets you rocket forward at high speed.
