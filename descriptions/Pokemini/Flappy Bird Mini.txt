Flappy Bird mini is a simple game where the player has to guide a bird through a level filled with pipes with only a small gap to pass.In the game, thrust needs to be maintained to navigate a level. The bird moves forward automatically and the player can only interact by tapping, making it flap its wings so it flies higher. As each passage has a different height, the player needs to tap or pause (causing the bird to dive down) to make sure it is able to pass. There is no end to the game, the goal is merely to get a high score and based on the total score different types of medals can be earned.
