Pokémon Shock Tetris is a Japan-exclusive Pokémon Mini puzzle game based on 
a falling-block mechanic similar to Tetris. Blocks featuring different Pokémon 
icons drop from the top of the screen, and the player rotates and arranges 
them to clear lines. The game includes multiple modes, difficulty options, and 
fast-paced play designed around short sessions on the Pokémon Mini system.
