As a variation on the Tetris gameplay them, the game used the motion detection feature of the Pokémon Mini hardware for the players to rotate the falling tetrominoes, and the player received a mild force feedback response to clearing lines of blocks. During play, removal of lines of blocks will unlock Pokémon creatures from Pokémon Gold and Silver, which are collected in an 'Pokédex'. The game features a simultaneous two-player mode using the infra-red connection between two Pokémon Mini handhelds.
