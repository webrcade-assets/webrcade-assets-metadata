At first glance, Lode Quest and Dream World seem like typical Bubble Bobble clones. There's basically two ways to solve each level: Either collect all the gems and escape with them, or defeat all enemies. The latter is often easier said than done, as all enemy types take different strategies. The most basic ones can just be jumped on and then used as projectiles to take out even more with them. But soon the two cute magician protagonists encounter a new helmet-wearing breed, that can't be attacked directly, but have to be lured into Lode Runner type manholes the heroes can create with their wands. When enemies learn to jump over said holes or there are no diggable ground tile available, the only way to get rid of them, anymore, is picking up a potion of invincibility that makes it possible to attack enemies directly with the wand, or use up one of the rare hidden spellbooks that wipe out all enemies on screen.
