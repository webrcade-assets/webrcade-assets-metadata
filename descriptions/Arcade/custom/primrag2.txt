Primal Rage II (also can be known as simply just Rage II) is the cancelled sequel to Primal Rage. It started development in 1996 and was set to be released in 1997, but the game was cancelled due to the shrinking popularity of arcades. The game would feature avatars of the gods as playable characters. Necrosan trapped the gods so they couldn't fight him, so the avatars had to save the gods by fighting each other to reach Necrosan. If the player were to beat Necrosan then they would get an ending. Only one cabinet of the game is known to exist, and it can be found at the Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois.

As of 02/11/2017, the emulation of the game is fully functional, thanks to YouTube user GruntZilla94.
