Lock&#039;n&#039;Chase &copy; 1981 Data East.

The game is a maze game. Like "Pac-Man", you&#039;re trying to eat up dots while four cops (with the names Spiffy, Smarty, Scaredy and Silly) try to stop you. While you don&#039;t have energizers to eat the cops with, you CAN block them off with walls (or better yet, try to trap them in the corners). When you&#039;re finished eating dots, there are two exits for you to escape from the cops.
