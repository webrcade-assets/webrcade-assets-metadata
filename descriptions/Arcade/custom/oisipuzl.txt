The game takes place on a game board where you take the role of Hebe. Each time you turn comes, a wheel determines how much spaces you go. When you land on a certain colored space, you go directly to a minigame. These minigames include spot the difference, put the puzzle together, find the character, and a crossword puzzle. The player can also land on a special space where you can use a special wheel. The wheel can either land on something that is useful for the player or could give the player bad luck. After you have beaten a board, you go on to the next one.
