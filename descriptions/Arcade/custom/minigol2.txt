Mini Golf is a golf arcade game, the players must use a track ball to direct their balls around an eighteen-hole course, featuring things such as: loops, waterfalls, warp holes, electric barriers, spinning triangles and discs, whirlpools, opening trap holes emerging bumpers, and even a giant skull. By finishing the holes which have a small flag beneath their bonus values, you shall earn "extra" holes (as you'll only start out with a certain number at the start of the game and shall have to finish these holes in order to play the others) - and the game also has a single button for positioning the ball on one of the three tees at the start of every hole. Once you've finished the eighteenth hole, you shall receive 1000 bonus points for every extra hole you have remaining and the game will end.
