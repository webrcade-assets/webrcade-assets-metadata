Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Cruisin (c) 1985 Jaleco.

A little red car does wheelies and jumps between platforms and colours them in as it drives on them. Collect and shoot oil cans at the cops, taxis, ambulances, etc... Watch out for the cat! Neat theme music and background pictures.
