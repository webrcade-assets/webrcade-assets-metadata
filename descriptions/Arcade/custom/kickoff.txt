The player gets to choose from one of 20 different national football teams. Each team has eleven players including strikers, defenders and one goalkeeper. The rules of the game are very reminiscent of real-life football. Each football round lasts 3 minutes. The player proceeds to compete against another team if he wins against the CPU, otherwise the game is over.
