You are in a maze with enemies, key squares and chests. Throw the chest at an enemy to trap them inside. Then throw the chest onto a key square to get coins to come out. Do not wait to long or the enemies will escape. Gather up these coins. If you do not have a chest and are faced with an enemy, use your stun shot to stop the temporarily. If you are surrounded, use your stun blast to temporarily stop all the enemies around and next to you
