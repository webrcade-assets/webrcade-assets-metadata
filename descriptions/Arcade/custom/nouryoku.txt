The game is made up of quiz sections, in which you play several minigames. Choosing correcting answers scores you points, while incorrect ones cost you life. The life meter also depletes as you take longer to answer a question. If the life meter empties, then the game is over. At the end of each round, the life meter is replenished depending on your percentage of correct answers and how fast you did the round. You'll then do a bonus round in which you answer as many correct questions in the limited time you have to score extra points and replenish more life. There are eight rounds in the whole game.
