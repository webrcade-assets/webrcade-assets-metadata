Lethal Crash Race is, as the title suggests, a racing game. The player chooses one of eight international characters then races one-on-one against the other characters (and the recolor of her/his own). Each race takes place in a different location around the world, and each character has her or his own ending, making the character interaction rather similar to that of Sonic Wings.

Lethal Crash Race marks the first appearance of Ellen and Cincia, who later feature in most of the Sonic Wings games.
