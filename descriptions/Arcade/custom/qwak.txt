Qwak! is an early light-gun game by Atari. Your goal is to use your rifle to shoot the ducks that fly across the screen. Ducks fly across the screen one at a time, and you're given three shots to get it. If you're successful, your hunting dog will go and collect the duck. The marsh reeds and tree branch are provided via a color overlay to give the feel of authenticity, and the game includes Atari and Kee's Durastress technology.
