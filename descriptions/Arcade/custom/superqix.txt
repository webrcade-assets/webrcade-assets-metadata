A worthy descendant of QIX, SUPER QIX has the same goal, to capture a certain area of ​​the screen, but this time the enemy is much prettier and, above all, much more alive.

The monsters are now circling the free area and preventing you from staying there to grab small portions of the screen because the slightest contact is fatal.

Cards and other bonuses escape when you capture certain parts of the screens and allow you to go faster, earn points, temporarily stop the enemy, or simply perform the word at the top of the screen and thus complete the level.
