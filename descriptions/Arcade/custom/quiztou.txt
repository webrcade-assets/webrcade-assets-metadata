The players must help four characters Kufū, Hana No Sei, Koseibutsugakusha and Nōfu regain control of an island by answering multiple-choice questions (much like what Scott and Stanley had to do to regain the crown's lost jewels for "Bakuretsu Quiz"); each of the characters starts out in one of the four corners of the island and conquers a square once they've cleared its stage. They can then decide which square they want to move to next, by pressing one of the Answer Buttons - and if one character moves onto another one's conquered square it will invoke a special type of quiz, in which the conquered square's owner will set the trespasser eight questions (and there will be a keyword that is common to all eight answers). If the trespasser answers all eight questions correctly, he (or she, in the case of Hana No Sei) will take possession of the square; but if they should get one wrong, the owner shall send the trespasser back to their last conquered square.
