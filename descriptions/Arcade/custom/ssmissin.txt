Alien forces have come and taken over your planet so in this vertically scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above you must fly your helicopter and destroy them all and save your planet. The game is split into stages and you must face wave after wave of various aliens ships as the game scrolls constantly. You start with basic lasers but power-ups in the shape of helicopters can be collected to upgrade your weapon. You also have three smart-bombs which will destroy all on the screen. At the end of the stage you face a large end of stage boss. Once defeated you move onto the next stage. If you touch any alien ships or bullets then you lose one of three lives and once they are lost it's game over but you can continue where you last died with extra credits. You can play with another player who both play at the same time.
