A year after the battle with the Red Falcon organization, Bill and Lance are sent on another mission. This time, the alien forces have taken over an allied military base somewhere in Africa, possessing most of its troops. Bill and Lance must not only fight against their former comrades-in-arms, but also a new mutated form of the same alien creatures they fought during their previous mission.
