Check Man is an arcade game where the player moves a man around a grid made up of squares that disappear after being walked over. The aim of each level is to defuse a number bombs which is done by simply moving over them. Each bomb has a counter and it is necessary to defuse them before the time runs out. The quicker the bombs are defused the more points will be earned. At the same time the player has to watch out for the stomping boots that move around the grid. Any contact with these will lead to the player getting killed and a life will be lost. In addition to bombs and boots there are also skulls which are stationary obstacles and flags which give bonus points. It is possible to slide the row of squares the player is standing on left or right as long as there is space left and the objects are not moved off the edge of the screen.
