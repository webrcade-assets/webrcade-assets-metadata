The player controls a clown, named “Mr. Do!”. Mr. Do is in his garden, and wants to collect the cherries there. Monsters roam there, and will not let Mr. Do quietly collect. If a monster touches Mr. Do, it dies, and the player loses a life. At each level a path is dug through the garden, going from the bottom to the top of the screen, passing through the center. Monsters can only take paths that have already been dug. Mr. Do is able to dig new paths, at the cost of slower movement speed.
