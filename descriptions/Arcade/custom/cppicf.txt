The player controls the Ice-cream man Peter Pepper with the object of placing ice-cream scoops into cones. The player can also put a scoop into a cone that already has a scoop. When all scoops are in cones, the player is taken to the next Pattern. Throwing an ice-cream scoop can send it up on a platform depending on the position. Living confectioneries and utensils will try to hinder Peter's progress, but they can be taken out by pushing or throwing an ice-cream scoop directly on them. Also enemies cannot harm Peter while they/he is climbing a ladder.
