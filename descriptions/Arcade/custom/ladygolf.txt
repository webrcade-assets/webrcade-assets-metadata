Vs. Stroke & Match: Golf is a golf game developed for the Vs. Arcade Systems and manufactured by Nintendo Company Limited in 1984. It is an 18 hole golf game where the player chooses stroke play or match play against a human or computer player. It is set to allow a certain number of swings per credit. The player gains or loses swings depending on the outcome of each hole. This same game was ported to the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System with very few differences.

This game was released in two editions, a Men's Golf and Ladies Golf edition featuring male and female characters. The unnamed golfer starring in the Men's Golf edition, shares a striking resemblance to Mario.
