Shootout is a shooting gallery-style arcade game with a mafia theme. The player must make their way through eight stages before they can take on the boss. In taking down the crowds of bad guys, caution must be exercised in not hitting innocent bystanders. Movement and aiming is handled with the 8-way joystick. And unlike games such as Taito's Operation Wolf, you directly control your player instead of just an aiming reticle. Button one is used for shooting while the second button is used to perform an evasive roll to dodge enemy fire and other hazards. An alternating 2-player mode is also available.
