You fight a variety of spacecrafts, tanks, static guns and bosses. While playing destroyed enemies drop power-ups. These include: a side weapon (floating rocket), short period shield (floating ring), speed power-up (S) and extra bomb (B). There is also a block that counts down from seven when shot on, with each number representing a different weapon pattern. The game can be played solo or with a friend.
