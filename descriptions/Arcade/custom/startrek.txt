STAR TREK is a 1- or 2-player SEGA Color X-Y video game with computerized speech synthesis. The player finds himself the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, his mission being to rid the universe of a number of threats to the United Federation of Planets.

STAR TREK has a unique method of displaying the information vital to the game play. This method involves the separation of the CRT into three completely separate screens.

The Scanner is where the player sees a top down or plan view of local space, with the Enterprise always in the center of this screen. The Viewer is where the player sees actual apparent 3-D images, as if he were looking out the ships front window. The Status screen displays player score in addition to Shield strength, number of Photon Torpedoes, and amount of Warp energy remaining.
