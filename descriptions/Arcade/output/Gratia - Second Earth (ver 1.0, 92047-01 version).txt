Gratia offers a rather particular perspective where the ground fills the whole screen (yes, yes!). This graphic bias is important, since your ship has, in addition to primary fire, an air-to-ground laser. This air-to-air / air-to-ground weaponry, after all very classic, is well highlighted here: there are permanently on the whole screen two types of enemies for which two different types of weapons must be used (nothing to do with Ikaruga however ...)

The game is rather pleasant to play without reaching peaks, and will no doubt appeal to fans of Darius from whom it is quite clearly inspired. Its great strength, however, is its graphics: once past the surprise of this visualization "in-profile-but-with-the-ground-above", we find ourselves in front of a game with colorful backgrounds, fine and varied sprites. and which even allows itself some well-felt zoom effects. No complaints on this point, it's all good.
