You control Chelnov, the atomic runner. Beginning in Russia, he has to run from left to right through several levels to reach the Statue of Liberty. Chelnov keeps running by himself until you stop him, and he can do somersaults which enables him to fire in other directions. Nasties are killed by shooting or jumping on them. There are several different types of weapons and power-ups all of which have their strengths and weaknesses against different enemies and bosses.
