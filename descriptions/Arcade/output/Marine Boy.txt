In Marine Boy, you play as a diver equipped with a harpoon who must at each level reach a mermaid in a shell located at the bottom of the water. This is a vertical shoot 'em up with a scroll down. You will face different sea creatures such as orcas, dolphins or jellyfish. Mermaids encountered along the way will give you bonus points. Be careful your oxygen is limited!
