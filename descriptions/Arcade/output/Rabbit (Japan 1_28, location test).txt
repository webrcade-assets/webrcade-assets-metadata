In Rabbit you will have a choice between 8 characters with a very neat design, halfway between manga and comic book style.
The special element in Rabbit is that each character has an animal spirit, allowing them to release its power when the "Beast" gauge is full.
With each victory you win your opponent's animal which is then added to yours. So as you advance through the game the number of special attacks at your disposal grows.
