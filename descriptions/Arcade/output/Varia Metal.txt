In the 25th century, the evil Ocayea Empire is threatening, and two brave warriors have emerged to fight for freedom. Gameplay is very generic and straightforward - the player flies forward, and shoots at enemies and bosses.He can collect power-ups - green balls that increase your fire-power. He can use a special, destructive shot - you must hold your fire for a moment, to load the laser. The game has multi-player mode, where the first player controls the man (Grey), & the second player the girl (Atuja) - Varia Metal hasn't got a selection screen.
