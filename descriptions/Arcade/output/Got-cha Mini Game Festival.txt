It's a collection of nineteen minigames that you can either choose to play one-by-one in an attempt to clear them all without running out of lives, or by selecting your favourites from a list. 
You've got three colour-coded buttons: red on the left, green in the middle and blue on the right. The majority of Got-Cha's minigames involve pressing the correct colour at the right moment, so try to fix the position of each colour firmly in you mind. Occasionally red and blue work as left and right, too.
