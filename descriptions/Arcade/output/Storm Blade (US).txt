Storm Blade is a military themed vertical scrolling shoot 'em up game where you take control of either Lucky J. Striker in his F14 Tomcat, Alex in his MiG-29 Fulcrum, Camel Yuki Anderson in her AV-BB Harrier II or old man Isoroku Kaionji in his Zero Fighter Kamikaze Special. Each with their own weapons patrons.

As you make progress and fight of various planes, helicopters, tanks, static guns, ships and bosses power-ups come available. Power-ups cans can be collected from destroyed enemies and increase your firepower. These come in two forms: a normal power-up (P) and a super power-up (F). There are also a limited number of super bombs available that do a vast amount of damage. Destroyed enemies sometimes drop additional super bombs (B). The game can be played solo or with a friend.
