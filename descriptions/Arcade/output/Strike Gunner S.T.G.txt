Strike Gunner S.T.G. is a vertical-scrolling jet fighter adventure set in the far-off year of A.D. 2008. The player controls their fighter as the scene unfolds around them, as enemies of air, land, and sea continuously enter the screen in wave after wave of assault. The player(s) begins with a set number of lives, a number which can be added to with good play. Run out, and your mission is over - there are no saves!
