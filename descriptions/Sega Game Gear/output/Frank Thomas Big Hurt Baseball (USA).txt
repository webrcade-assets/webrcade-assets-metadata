Frank wanted big league technology to match his two-time MVP award-winning style. He wanted authentic gameplay like pitchers losing arm strength. He wanted CD-quality sound FX including umpire calls, crowd cheering and bat cracking. He wanted 8 pitch selections and 27 stat categories. He wanted 6 modes of play including Season, All-Star Game, Home Run Derby, Playoffs, and Batting Practice. He wanted 28 3D rendered stadiums to crank home runs. He wanted motion captured sprites. And he wanted a ton of camera angles to check out all the action... he got it!
