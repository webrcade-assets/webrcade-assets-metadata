To: James Pond... For your fish eyes only! Pond, the fiendish Dr. Maybe is back. His bombs are ticking in the North Pole toy factories. No human crime fighter has been able to defeat him. So F.I.S.H. (Finned Investigators of Shady Humans) has designed a special Robosuit for your survival on land. Pond, go to it! Remember, Dr. Maybe has a screw loose, so stay on your fins!
