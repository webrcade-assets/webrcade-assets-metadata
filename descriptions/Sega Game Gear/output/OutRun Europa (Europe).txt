Outrun Europa - a 7 stage race across Europe, in an attempt to avoid capture. Race across the English Channel on a super-fast jetski, battle bumper-to-bumper with secret agents in your Porsche 911 or Ferrari F40, hit 170 mph through congested streets on your adrenaline-pumping Yamaha GP. Break waves in the Med on your turbo-charged power boat and foil your enemies as you seek to retrieve secret files. This time only your wits, courage and sheer driving skill will determine your fate!
