KLAX - the latest, greatest hit in the arcades - is now available for play on the GameGear! This brainteaser of a game is simple in concept: Catch colored tiles that come down the conveyor belt. Rack up points by arranging them in same-colored stacks or rows. A tic-tac-tile test, if you will. Sounds easy? It is... until the tiles come tumbling at you so fast, you'll go nuts trying to catch them all - while figuring out where best to stack them before you run out of room! But no matter how tough KLAX gets, the hardest part is pulling yourself away from this fun, fast, and totally mind-boggling game!
