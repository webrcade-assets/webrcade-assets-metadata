An unlicensed IBM PC translation of the arcade hit - created around the same time as Atarisoft's official PC port. Accordingly, the player controls a gun which can be moved throughout the bottom of a mushroom-littered playfield, and must curb the attacks of assorted pests: the centipede, which traces a path between the mushroom and may be split into segments; the spider, which devours both mushrooms and the player; the flea, which deposits new mushrooms in its wake; and the scorpion which poisons the mushrooms, sending the centipede links into free-fall on contact.
One or two players may participate, and the selectable skill level adjusts the speed of the game.
