Man 'O War: Grand Tactical Naval Combat Under Sail is a 1–2 player strategy wargame based upon naval combat from 1765–1815.Designed for 1–2 players, each player controls a side. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. Twelve scenarios are included, as well as a scenario builder. Each of the pre-generated scenarios can be manipulated in a number of ways.During each turn the player can set naval doctrine for their fleet, set orders, and receive ship reports.  Between turns, actions and encounters take place where the player has little input.  Under naval doctrine, the player can set how their vessels close in on enemies, how close they approach, distance when they open fire, and sail level when in combat.  This can be set to individual ships or classes of ships. Individual movement orders can also be sent to each ships from the flagship.From individual ship reports, the player can review weather conditions, ship condition, and view the ocean from the deck of the ship.  An overview map shows the location of known vessels.
