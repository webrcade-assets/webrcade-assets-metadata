Aspetra is a Japanese-style RPG. The player spends much time in the wilderness and in dungeons while randomly being attacked by groups of 1-5 enemies (always of a single type). Then their pictures blend in over the current background image and the player has to fight them in semi-turn-based combat: you can only act once your turn comes up, but if you take too long, monsters will continue taking their turns. The available options are attacking with weapons, using an item, or running away. Eventually the player may also learn how to use magic spells. When the hero is victorious, he receives coins, experience points, and eventually a level-up which heals him and improves his stats.
In towns, the hero can either visit an inn for full recovery, talk to the population, or visit a shop to buy/sell items and equipment. Weapons increase damage output, shields increase physical defence, and rings increase magic defence. Items and equipment may also be found within treasure chests.
