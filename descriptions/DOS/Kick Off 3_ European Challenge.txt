Kick Off 3: European Challenge is an updated version of Kick Off 3. Whereas the original game only featured national teams, this version allows the player to take control of all club teams from the top divisions of five European countries: England, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. For each country a league or a cup can be played and there is also a European cup with teams from all countries as well as individual friendlies. The European cup and friendlies also allow the player to select teams from other countries. For copyright reasons, all player names are misspelled (for example Barcelona features Rommario, Haggi and Coeman). The names can however be edited.
There are also some changes to the gameplay. This includes changes to the control systems to make it playable with a one button joystick (on Amiga) and new sound effects (for example when goals are scored) and improved graphics with more animations. Another addition is special key players that bring special playing styles to their sides.
