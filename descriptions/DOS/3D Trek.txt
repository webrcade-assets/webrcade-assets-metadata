3D Trek is a single-player adventure game based, unofficially, on Star Trek, the original series.
The game was developed using Domark's Virtual Reality Studio and it's a timed adventure game which, given the similarity of the corridors plays like a maze exploration game. The self destruct sequence on the USS Enterprise has been triggered and the player must explore the ship and some off-ship areas to find five coloured objects plus a few tools, take them to the Engineering section, access the computer terminal there and prevent the detonation. All of this must be accomplished before the timer runs out.
The game can be played by the mouse, keyboard, or joystick and it has some basic sound effects such as 'Bong' when the player walks into a wall or a 'Whoosh' when an action is triggered. It can be played in English, French, German or Italian.
