Get Lost! is a spacey 3D maze game played from a first-person perspective: the shareware version has a selection of 8 mazes, while the registered version features over 50 of them. The various maze layouts fully exploit the third dimension, with ramps, slopes and multi-leveled platforms; you are confined to the path (no jumping or falling), but you can look up and down. Certain floor sections may trigger actions - on the spot or remotely - and modify the environment in certain ways, which is often a necessary part of the solution.The competition is against the clock, and when a maze is completed, your performance is compared with a hypothetical ranking of whimsical creatures. To make things more interesting, each maze contains a secret - finding it will often involve invisible (or hard to find) walkways, or performing some kind of hidden action. Discovering enough secrets will unlock entirely new secret mazes, too.
