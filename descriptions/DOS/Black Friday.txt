A stock market simulation for 1-4 players, each with a starting investment of $5000 and a straightforward goal: become filthy rich by trading in 10 different securities.  Written originally for the DEC PDP-10, and published in the Jan. 1977 issue of Byte magazine, the game is built around a realistic (non-random) simulation of the stock market, which lasts from 3 to 10 game years.
Each year represents a turn, in which players receive dividends and may buy and sell stocks.  Bull market and bear market periods will influence stock values accordingly; stocks must be surrendered if the company goes bankrupt, and split when their value rises to $150.
