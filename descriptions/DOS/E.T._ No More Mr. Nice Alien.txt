A minigame for a three-hour Blender competition (#19) demanding works incorporating the three subjects "E.T.", "being scared" and "Stonehenge", this title adeptly strings them together, permitting the player to play E.T., frying tourists who are being scared at Stonehenge... er, with destructive rays fired from the tip of his glowing finger. Plot niceties such as why E.T., the friendly extra-terrestial, has such anger at the tourists -- or since when his finger began packing such a payload -- are largely unexplored here.
As far as gameplay goes, the following can be said: the tourists run at varying speeds, and can only be shot when the finger is fully charged -- beyond these factors, the rule of the day is "if it moves, shoot it!"
