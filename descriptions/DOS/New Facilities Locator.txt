New Facilities Locator is an add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Flight Assignment: Airline Transport Pilot and other subLOGIC flight simulations.
It allows players to transport themselves to any airport, nav-aid, route intersection, waypoint or other identifiable location without having to type in the facility coordinates. Instead there are menus showing all facilities and they can be selected right away. It contains the location of all airports, intersections and waypoints, and the locations and frequencies of all VORs, NDBs, and ILS approaches for the default simulation scenery and for all Scenery Disks add-ons.
A new "quick position set" menu system lets you instantly place yourself at any location relative to a facility simply by specifying altitude, direction and distance. The program automatically orients your aircraft to face the facility.
Another new feature lets you name and save your own reference locations in any scenery area. Instantly move to your favorite scenery highlights with a simple keypress. Or transport the aircraft to scenery areas you create with Microsoft Aircraft & Scenery Designer.
Standard nav-aid menus are designed to help you easily set up flight training situations. You can position your aircraft at any location and orientation relative to the selected nav-aid, and automatically tune the navigation radio(s) to the proper frequency. Or use the airport menu to place the aircraft on any runway threshold at any airport.
