In the centre of the game area is a cross representing runways 1 and 2. Aircraft appear in the window identified by a letter, their height and direction. The player enters commands to alter the heading, the height and so-on in order to bring planes into land or to guide other planes through take-off to an exit point.As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
