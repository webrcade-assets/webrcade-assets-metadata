Bringing the art of Breakout -cloning to Tandy 1000 BASIC, Breakoff provides yet another account of the age-old enmity between orb and masonry. A wall of bricks is placed across the top of the screen, opposite the laterally-moving paddle below, as the player deflects the bouncing ball and attempts to knock down the barrier one block at a time.
Point values depend on the smashed brick's position; those higher up award larger bonuses. There are three balls at your disposal, and if you lose them all it's game over. Unlike more complete variants, the wall does not renew itself after all the bricks are destroyed, so the player is left with a fixed maximum score (and not much else to do).
