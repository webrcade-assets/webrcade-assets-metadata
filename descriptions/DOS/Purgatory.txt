High school student Lewis was been having a wonderful day. She's been hired to be the cover model of Eccenza, one of the top teen magazines, and offers for many other modeling gigs. But then a strange earthquake brings her school into another world. Where strange humanoid creatures roam, intent on killing her, and the vice-principal has declared martial law. At the center of it all is her stalker, Bauer, who seems to have brought forth this strange world.So begins Purgatory, a RPG with a survival horror theme. Combat is done like a Final Fantasy game, but there are no towns or stores. Instead the player only gets items he finds lying around or can build from resources found/taken from dead enemies. Proper rationing of these item is key to surviving, as is avoiding combat by not touching enemies.
