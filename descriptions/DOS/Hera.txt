Over time, one member known as Zarabae sought to have complete dominance of the land by destroying the rest of the council. Rhin was another of these leaders, and sensing Zarabae's deceit, he crafted a great magical sword. Before this sword could be used, Rhin fell in battle, and the sword was lost.Played from a turn-based top-down perspective, gameplay commands and movement are via keyboard shortcuts.

Combat is turn based, and monsters appear on the overworld map, track the player, and engage in combat. In combat, the player and enemies taking turns striking each other. The player eventually gains access to boats, and then a submarine, to aid in exploration of the overworld.
