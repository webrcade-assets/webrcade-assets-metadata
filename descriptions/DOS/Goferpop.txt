Goferpop is a 2D 50K shooting game in which the player shoots gophers that pop out of the ground. The game field is a row of grass and the gophers will pop out anywhere on the field. The mouse is used to move a gun back and forth and when a gopher appears the player must click the mouse in order to shoot it. The score is based on how many gophers are killed and how quickly, as measured by the "Gophers shot per hour" metric. There is no game over, but there is a high score table.
