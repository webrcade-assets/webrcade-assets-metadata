In Arkansas, a shipment of gold bars was stolen and its drivers killed. The four people responsible get away, but later they rob a bank, an event which goes poorly. Three of them are sent to the electric chair, but the fourth gets life in prison. In prison he meets with Kane, our protagonist, who discovers that the gold is now near Seattle. Once he serves his sentence, he finds his girlfriend, Lorry, and sets off. Unfortunately, the area the gold is in contains werewolves...Hurlements is something of an informal sequel to Zombi from some of the same team. You control Kane and Lorry with a set of about 20 commands, ranging from simple movement to attacking werewolves and using items. Combat is done by a sliding bar, hit the button at the right moment to deal the most damage. To win the game you need to find the gold and repair a nearby car, before you become werewolf chow.
