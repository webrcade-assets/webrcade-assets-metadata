Pursue the Pennant is a computer baseball simulation. Players can simulate individual games or entire seasons throughout baseball history. The game allows for one or two players, and the computer manager is fully capable of playing out the remainder of the schedule. The ballpark, weather and temperature can all effect the outcomes of each play, while play-by-play commentary describes the action on the field. Different eras in the history of baseball come into play as well (better fielding equipment, playing fields, turf etc.) affecting the number of defensive errors in various periods. You can customize manager profiles to determine how often each skipper tries to bunt, hit-and-run, allow baserunners to steal and more.
