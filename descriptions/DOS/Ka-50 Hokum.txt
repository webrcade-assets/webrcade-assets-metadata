In this game you are a commander of a Base Ship cruising around Indonesia and a pilot of four helicopters available on it. These helicopters are Kamov Ka-50 Hokum (assault), MIL Mi-8 Hip (assault/transport), Westland Lynx (anti-ship assault/transport), and Bell AH-1 Cobra (assault). And your mission is to end piracy on those waters.
You are planning the schedule of your missions and completing them with an appropriate helicopter. Planning of missions is based on your previous reconnaissance flights. Missions vary from intercept pirate boats, escort ship through pirate waters, and provide air support, to unload battalion of jungle commandos, rescue an ejected pilot, and annihilate villages. During the mission the player can switch back to Base Ship and plan other missions.
The game builds upon Super-VGA Harrier, but this time with helicopters.
