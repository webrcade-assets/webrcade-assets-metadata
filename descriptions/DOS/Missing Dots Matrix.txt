This program displays phrases that appear to have been printed on a defective dot matrix printer -- they are missing lines of pixels.  The greater the difficulty level (Easy, Medium or Hard), the more pixels are missing.  The player must figure out what the phrase says and type it in.  Answering correctly leads to more information relating to the phrase (the person who said a famous quote or the answer to a riddle) and a congratulatory line of synthesized speech.  The game's instructions include information on creating your own puzzles for use with the program.
