Spelldiver is a 1-player educational game for multiple changes.
The player controls a scuba diver who must descend from their boat into the ocean to uncover words. As the player explores the bottom of the ocean, they clear algae from large letters covering multiple screens. As the letters are cleared, the player can review them. Once enough of the word is cleared, the player can return to their dive boat to try to guess the word. If the player guesses wrong, they must search the bottom of the ocean for pearls for another attempt to guess the word. The player has limited oxygen, and will lose the game if they run out. The player can return to the dive boat to replenish their oxygen. The player tries to avoid sharks and fish, as these will temporarily stun the player.
The player can search for custom letters or different levels of difficulty. In Gabdoc's Note's Home, the player must complete words to finish a story.
