A variation on the TRON -inspired Light Cycle concept; the action takes place in an arena where the player must steer the Laser Cycle, keeping away from the walls and dodging a series of homing missiles. The craft leaves behind a laser trail, which can be transformed into an energy barrier for short sections to block the missiles.Energy barriers cost power, and collectible power pods restore it. According to your chosen skill level, the pace gets faster as the game progresses and the missiles are guided more efficiently; the length of your energy barrier is reduced, power pods disappear faster, and the arena walls start closing in - quick reflexes will be required to survive.
