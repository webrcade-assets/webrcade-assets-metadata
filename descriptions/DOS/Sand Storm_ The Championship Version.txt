Sand Storm: The Championship Version is an alternate version of the original Sand Storm. People who registered the shareware version of the original game had a choice to buy an expanded version of the game for an extra fee.
The Championship Version not only includes the original Scuds, Jets and Tomahawk scenarios, it also includes six new levels: Tanks! You must use your tank (located on the left) to destroy the enemy's armed transports (which are on the right side of the screen). Your goal is to destroy at least 50% of the trucks while evading all enemy fire from the transports.
The game also included printed instructions and hints, and a free bonus game.
