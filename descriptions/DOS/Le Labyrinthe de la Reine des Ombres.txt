Of course, it becomes our task to lift it, by traveling around the world, meeting its inhabitants and helping them with their needs.The process consists of solving different puzzles and riddles aimed at checking the French kids' ability to read and understand short lines of texts; the answers are given by choosing the correct reply among the several options presented by the game. There are exercises like hidden word search, solving simple cryptograms etc. There are also three mini-games: a maze where we have to find our way from one corner into the opposite one while not running into enemies; a simple memory game for locating pairs of medallions; and a sea arcade where we have to maneuver out little boat in order to evade arrows falling from the above.
