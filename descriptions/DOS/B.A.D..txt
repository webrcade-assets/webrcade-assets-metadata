B.A.D. is a fixed-screen shooter where players must repel attacks from the Martian commander Rupert. The ship is confined to the lower part of the screen and can only move left and right. The objective is to eliminate all enemy waves to complete each level. Defeated enemies may drop credits or power-ups that enhance the shipâ€™s defensive and offensive capabilities. While most power-ups are beneficial, one can completely disarm the ship. Upgrades can also be purchased in the in-game shop using collected credits, accessible at any time without pausing the action. The game features eight levels and a high-score list.
