MagiDuck is a 2D scrolling platform game for the original IBM PC with a CGA card. It uses a tweaked 40x25 text mode to achieve a graphical resolution of 80x50 with 16 colours.
The protagonist is a little duck who tries to find out who attacked her family castle, while her family is away. She can jump and shoot fireballs, but not fly. On her way up the castle tower to the enemy, she has to overcome various obstacles and find the star, hidden in each level, to proceed. The enemies who stand in her way, can be defeated by shooting fireballs at them.
