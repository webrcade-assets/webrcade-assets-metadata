Korenvliet is an unofficial adaptation of Stoneville Manor. Initially spread through the P2000 Nat. Lab. Thuis Computer Club and later the Philips P2000 Computer Club. The game plays mostly the same but names have been altered and the whole game has been translated into Dutch using elements from the book series Adriaan en Olivier by Leonard Huizinga.Ironically the game was ported to GW-BASIC in 2016, where it was translated back into English. The English version retains the Dutch title and name of uncle Wout who replaces the original Mr. Stone.
