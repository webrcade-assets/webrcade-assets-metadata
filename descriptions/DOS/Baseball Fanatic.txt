One of the early computer baseball simulations, Baseball Fanatic offers in-game management for two human opponents, human vs. computer, or computer vs. computer matchups. The user can choose from five levels of offense (super slugfest, slugfest, pitcher's duel, average big leagues or "pot luck"). Select your lineup and manage individual games or utilize the "Watch the Scoreboard" feature which generates rapid results without user intervention. You can periodically review the season standings, compile statistics and create your own teams using a combination of statistics and subjective ratings.
