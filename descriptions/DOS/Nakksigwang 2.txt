Nakksigwang 2 is a fishing simulation and a follow-up to Nakksigwang. Like the predecessor, the sequel allows the player to choose between four different locations for fishing. These locations are visually more distinct than in the first game, and sometimes require different methods of fishing, e.g. choosing different types of bait prevalent in the terrain, etc. Rods, lines, and hooks are now graphically represented in a special menu.
