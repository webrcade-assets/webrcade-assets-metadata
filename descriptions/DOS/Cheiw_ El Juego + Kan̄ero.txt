Cheiw: El Juego + KanÌ„ero is a promotional game for the chewing gum Cheiw. It was available as mail-order when sending in a certain amount of gum wrappers to the manufacturer.
The world is overrun by evil aliens and the hero called +K, a male teenager, has to infiltrate their base and collect 25 puzzle pieces. The base is viewed from the side perspective and scrolls in all four directions. The hero can change platforms and collecting items by jumping. Unfortunately the aliens won't tolerate +K's presence which means he has to fight them. And the weapon of choice is, of course, Cheiw bubble gum. There are four enemy types and each of them is vulnerable to a different flavor. Except the starting flavor, they have to be found within the level.
