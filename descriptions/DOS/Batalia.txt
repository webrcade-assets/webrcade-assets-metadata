This two-player, ASCII-based arena combat game has a backstory: you and your co-pilot have been busted by Galactic police for smuggling illegal goods.  As it turns out, Galactic justice doesn't screw around, and in a touch of Imperial Roman flair, you've both been tossed into a labyrinth to duke it out with each other gladiator-style.  Only one will emerge alive.Each player is given a ship, which can shoot in four directions at once.  The arena's layout changes on every round, but the premise remains the same - maneuver your combat ship around the playing field, use the walls for cover, and kill your opponent.  The first player to win ten rounds will emerge victorious.
