Sky Cat is an action game with puzzle elements, where the player controls the space probe "Sky Cat" on the mission to find and rescue hostages on the alien enemy base. The probe breaks through the base, shooting the enemies with a laser in the way inspired by Thexder and solving the puzzles to overcome different obstacles toggling the electromagnet within its hull. Enemies are also shooting at the probe, trying to decrease its energy. The game is ended either with a successful mission accomplishment or with probe destruction.
