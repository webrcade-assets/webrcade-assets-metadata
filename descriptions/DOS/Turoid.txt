Turoid is an Arkanoid clone, where the point is - like in many other games like it - to bounce a ball with a paddle in order to destroy all the bricks on a given level.The paddle is controlled with a mouse (the mouse sensitivity can be adjusted with the numeric keys). The bricks come in various types: the green, orange and white bricks can be destroyed simply by hitting them; the yellow brick can be destroyed only after picking up a certain powerup; the purple brick contains a ball that will fall down after destroying it - two hits with such a ball will destroy your paddle; the gold bricks are "special" and many various, benevolent effects may occur when they are hit. Only the green, orange and white bricks need to be destroyed to complete the level.A level editor application is included with the game.
