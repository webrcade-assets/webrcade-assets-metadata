Hurra Deutschland is a sarcasm election campaign satire - playing in 1994 just before the election of Helmut Kohl as German Chancellor - with the dolls from German TV show "Hurra Deutschland" and "Zak": the german version of the British cult show "Spitting Image".In Hurra Deutschland you're playing Paul. Paul is a lazy guy of poor intelligence, and a life-long dreamer (he always dreams of a wonderful life in the Caribbean). One day Paul gets a mysterious call: He can get Federal Chancellor - if he does an perfect electoral campaign. You as Chancellor instead of Helmut Kohl or Rudolf Scharping! But only a few days left...Slip into the role of Paul and win the campaign. Paul's strategy is to run down Kohl and Scharping in tv shows. Also you recognize a worldwide complot which will drop the German Republic into a deep crisis if you're unable to bring it to light.
