The classic economics-themed board game gets a cartoony overhaul in this official adaptation from SuperVision for Amiga and DOS.The game is set in London and does not offer much room for customization: only an internal clock that adds a time limit to a game.Up to eight personalities, either human or CPU, can be selected at the start of a game. When controlled by the computer, a personality has its own way of playing: greedy, crafty or timid on three skill levels.The contestants are, viewed on-screen from left to right: Farmer Barrow (using a Wheelbarrow-piece on the board), Lord Topper (Hat), Bosun Barnacle (Steamboat), Granny Knot (Eggcup), General Hobnail (Boots), Miss Trixie (Dog), Mobile Michael (Car) and Mrs Starch (Smoothing iron).During gameplay the board is displayed from a top-down 3D-perspective with the contestants gathered around it. When a piece enters a property-tile, the game switches to a separate screen with the property shown in detail. A personality can quit the game anytime which triggers a cartoony violent animation to be displayed.The game is icon-controlled and can be saved anytime to disk.
