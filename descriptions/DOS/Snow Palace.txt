Snow Palace is a snow-themed Soko-Ban variant with a twist: the playing field is covered with ice, so if a box (ice block in this game) is pushed by the player it will not just move one tile at a time, but slides across the field until it reaches the edge or bumps into an obstacle.
The plot of the game is that the player is part of an expedition that explores a mountaintop palace. The place's magic transforms the player character into a statue, and to escape and get back to normal, a series of rooms must be traversed, each room unlocked by placing ice cubes on top of red switches. The game has five levels.
Snow Palace was written in QuickBasic and released as freeware by its author.
