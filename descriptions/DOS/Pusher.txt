A tiny implementation of the Sokoban box-pushing puzzle genre, Pusher fits it all into a paltry 512 bytes of space - including code, level data, graphics (implemented as a custom text-mode font) and sound. Due to the extreme compactness, only one level is supplied, although it consists of several mini-puzzles that require progressively greater cleverness to maneuver the crates into their target spots. Assembly source code is provided, and new levels can be converted from text files using the included Python script.
