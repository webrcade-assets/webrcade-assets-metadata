In 1995 21st Century Entertainment licensed several already-released pinball tables to the online distribution company Instant Access, which bundled them in a compilation named Perfect Pinball. The pack features content of three previous games:* Pinball Dreams (1993): Ignition, Steel Wheels, Beat Box, Nightmare

Pinball Dreams 2 (1994): Safari, Revenge of the Robot Warriors, Stall Turn, Neptune
Pinball Fantasies (1994): Partyland

Of the nine tables, only three are playable - Safari, Stall Turn and Revenge of the Robot Warriors. The other six must be purchased and unlocked via the included Instant Access browser. The basic price is £5 for one table (~ $8 in 1995), £12 for three (~ $19), payable by debit or credit card. The activation procedure requires buyers to call a local phone number and exchange 18-digit code numbers.
While the game itself remains a pure DOS program, the Instant Access browser requires Windows 3.1 or better to run.
All tables exist in the original low-res VGA version (320x200) as well as in a high-res SVGA alternative (640x350). The CD contains two audio tracks. Perfect Pinball includes the "History of Pinball" feature, a database with facts and artworks for a broad selection of historical pinball machines.
