Crazy Adventure in Africa is a digital board game with mechanics similar to Monopoly. The goal is to accumulate wealth and the winner is the one who first reaches the treasure. The game's style incorporates African culture with grasslands, pyramids, rainforests and African totems. Players must manage their own property, occupy land that can be mined, build hotels or farms, and accumulate wealth while buying bullets, medicines, locals and food before they can enter the inner circle to find treasures.
