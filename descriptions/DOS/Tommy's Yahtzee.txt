Tommy's Yahtzee is a shareware implementation of the popular dice game.This implementation is for up to eight players.The objective is to score points by creating various combinations on each roll of the five dice. After the first roll, any number of dice can be rolled again to achieve a desirable set. The game's score sheet is divided into two parts, the upper part contains boards 1-6 where the player scores the number of ones, twos, threes etc on that roll. The lower part of the board can vary depending on the mode of game being played.The standard game of Yahtzee is played with a lower the following lower boards:Three of a kind - scores the sum of all the diceFour of a kind - scores the sum of all the diceA Full House, two of one number and three of another, scores 25 pointsA small straight, any sequence of four dice, scores 30 pointsA large straight, any sequence of five dice, scores 40 pointsA 'Chance' which is the sum of all five dice in any roll, no specific requirementsA Yahtzee where all five dice have the same number. This scores 50 points and may be scored multiple times but at the expense of one of the other options.An upper board bonus of 35 points can be scored if the upper board totals more than 62 pointsIn the Yacht variation the lower board consists of fewer options and is scored differently:Four of a kind - scores the sum of all the diceA Full House, two of one number and three of another, scores the sum of the diceA little straight is 1,2,3,4,5 and scores 30 pointsA big straight is 2,3,4,5,6 and scores 30 pointsA 'Chance' which is the sum of all five dice in any roll, no specific requirementsA Yacht where all five dice have the same number scores 50 points and may only be scored once.This variation also has a special rule whereby the first roll must be to the lower board and the player must continue to roll until a Yacht is achieved. The player's score is docked five points for every roll and should their score become negative their yacht is said to be 'sunk'.In the Crag variation the game is played with just three dice and the lower board is as follows:Three of a kind - scores 25 pointsA low straight (1,2,3) scores 20 pointsA high straight (4,5,6) scores 20 pointsAn odd straight (1,3,5) scores 20 pointsAn even straight (2,4,6) scores 20 pointsA Crag, any three dice that total 13 points and which contains a pair, scores 50 pointsA Thirteen, any three dice which total 13, scores 26 points.As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
