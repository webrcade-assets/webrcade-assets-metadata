In the game Around the World, players assume the role of Wolf, an anthropomorphic wolf tasked by a museum to collect treasure from four global locations. These include China, New York, Greece, and a jungle, each teeming with stereotypical enemies and graphics. Despite the narrative, the primary objective in each side-scrolling level is to reach the end by jumping over pits and evading adversaries. Wolf can eliminate enemies by shooting them with his weapon; holding the button extends the projectile’s range. Along the way, Wolf can also gather secondary treasures for bonus points and cakes, which allow to cheat death once when touched by enemies. Falling onto spikes is always fatal -unless they are fake and conceal bonus areas or shortcuts. Upon dying, Wolf respawns at the level’s beginning, while the status of enemies and treasure remains unchanged.
