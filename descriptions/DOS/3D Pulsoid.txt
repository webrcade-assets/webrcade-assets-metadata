3D Pulsoid is a Breakout / Arkanoid style game for one or two players. It is an updated version of Pulsoid that was marketed as shareware. In spite of the "3D" part in the title, the game still uses sprites, which are identical to the original Pulsoid 's, and introduces no gameplay changes -- only the levels are different. The original, freeware Pulsoid levels are also included and can be played via the User Levels option.
3D Pulsoid retains the same game modes, allowing to play either with bouncing snakes (which mimic the original "Laserpulse" from ZX Spectrum's Pulsoids that inspired this game in the first place) or with more typical Breakout style pong balls. In the game options, these can be set to bounce either randomly or always at a fixed angle.
The game comes with a level editor and the built-in support for user levels, just like the original Pulsoid.
