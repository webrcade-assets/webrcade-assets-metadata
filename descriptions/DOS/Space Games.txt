Space Games is a bundle of four already classic games hacked to pretend that they were different games and/or made by Keypunch:

Alien (1982) hacked to show the title as Alien Explorer and Keypunch Software as the maker.
Lunar Landing (1982)
NewTrek (1982) hacked to show the title as Space Trek and unable to show instructions.
Space Attackers II (1985) called Invaders in the menu

To access the games there is a simple text menu with coloured words, and additionally you can check the list of Keypunch products. Space Attackers II requires a reboot both to enter and exit the game.
