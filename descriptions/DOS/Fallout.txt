Fallout is a single player, keyboard controlled, tile matching game.
Blocks fall from the top of the screen. They are always three coloured bricks long and the object of the game is to create horizontal, vertical or diagonal strings, of the same coloured brick that are three or more bricks on length. Such strings explode and disappear scoring the player points and causing the blocks above to drop down to fill any vacant slots. Occasionally the falling block contains a bomb that can be used to blow up nearby bricks.
There is sound and a boss key and a high score table.
