Pop't'Balls is an unofficial PC conversion of the Amstrad CPC game Zap't'Balls. Similar to Buster Bros./Pang, it can be played by one or two players, whose objective is to clear the screen of all bouncing balls without getting touched by any of them.Each ball hit by the player's grappling hook splits into two smaller balls (except for the first tutorial level where the ball just shrinks in size), and the smallest ones disappear entirely when burst by the player's attacks. Later levels introduce various obstacles that affect both the player's movement and the movement of the balls, which may be either used to the player's advantage or complicate matters, depending on the situation. After completing a stage, the player receives a three-letter password that may be used to start the game from the most recently played level.Pop't'Balls was sold as shareware. The unregistered version contains only a limited set of levels.
