Rampcube is a single player, shareware, falling block puzzle game.The game is entirely keyboard controlled. Coloured tiles slide down a ramp and the player controls a grey catcher which collects them as they reach the edge. Once collected the player positions the catcher over the play area and drops the tile into the desired position. Tiles which are not collected fall into the play area but not under the player's control. The object of the game is to build cubes, 2x2 arrangements of tiles of the same colour before the play area fills up. The more cubes that are assembled the more bonus points are scored.The game has sound, and both pause and high score features.
