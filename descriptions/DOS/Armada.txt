Operation Just Because is a single-player implementation of the classic Battleship game. In this game the player can play against either another person or one of three AI opponents of different strengths, though the toughest opponent is not available in the shareware version.
The game is played on a grid and starts with the player(s) placing their fleet and then firing into the opponents grid until all ships of one side have been destroyed, once the player has fired the scene changes to give an animated view of the shot landing. This implementation has a couple of novel optional features:* Fighters: each player has one stealth fighter that flies from the aircraft carrier. They are equipped with guided missiles and make random attacks on the enemy. Their effectiveness increases when the enemy's jammers are damaged/destroyed

IR Scopes and Jammers: used to identify targets, yellow dots show possible targets, red shows targets on fire, blue low heat targets such as mines.

Mines: the game places one or two randomly mines in each grid. Anything within two squares will be hit if they are detonated

The game can be played with the keyboard or the mouse, has sound effects, and a high score table.
