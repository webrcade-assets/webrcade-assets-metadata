Tubular Worlds was a fairly popular shareware side-scrolling shooter which was commercially released in 1994. The game features a variety of weapons and enemies. It is divided into four worlds and each of them consists of four stages. Gameplay is rather basic and there are many similarities to "R-Type". The game can be played by one or two simultaneous players on three different difficulty levels.
