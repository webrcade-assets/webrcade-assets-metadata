In Botsoccer 128 teams with robot players organize a soccer championship. The first playing mode is the whole tournament where the player chooses one or more teams he wants to support. Every team consists of four players with different advantages and disadvantages. They can be sold and replaced on the player market, e.g. with spider or worm robots. Additionally there are extra upgrades to be purchased, e.g. legs to outrun the opponent's players.
The game itself is played in a top down perspective and one half time lasts 100 seconds. It is possible to save the tournament status. Two other playing options are a training mode and a smaller tournament with an K.O. system.
