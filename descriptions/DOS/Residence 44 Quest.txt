Residence 44 Quest is a graphic adventure game created by two students at the Technical University Delft in the Netherlands, who based the setting of the game on their own experiences at the university. You play the role of a freshman student who, as the game begins, is arriving by bicycle to live with several housemates in a residential block. You first task is to get let inside the building, which seems simple enough but requires some persistence. You then need to make your way upstairs, introduce yourself to each of your housemates, and settle into life at Residence 44.The main character is directly controlled using the cursor keys to walk in the main four directions, and the player can also type in commands. You will often need to move close enough to an object before you can successfully interact with it.The game was first created in Dutch and then translated to English, but the English version is also edited down with some response text removed instead of translated.
