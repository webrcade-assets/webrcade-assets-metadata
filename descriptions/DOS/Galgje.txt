Galgje is the Dutch version of Hangman. The game shows a row of dots which represents the letters of a word. The player has to guess this word by entering letters. When a letter is in the word a dot is replaced by this letter. When a letter is not in the word part of a gallows is drawn. The player receives points by guessing the right word. After 10 wrongly guessed letters the gallows is completely drawn and the round is over. The game ends after 10 rounds.
