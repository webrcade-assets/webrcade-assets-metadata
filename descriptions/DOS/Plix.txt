Plix is a single player, keyboard controlled, shareware logic puzzle from Soleau Software.
In each puzzle the player faces a grid containing assorted shapes in some of the cells. Below the grid are outlines of some of the coloured shapes that are in the grid. The player's task is to manoeuvre the shapes in the upper grid and drop them onto the corresponding outlines. The player uses the arrow keys to move a red box around the screen, when this comes up against one of the shapes in the grid the shape will move and will continue to travel in the direction it was pushed until it hits another object or the edge of the game area.
The full game has fifty puzzles, each puzzle has an animated worked solution.
