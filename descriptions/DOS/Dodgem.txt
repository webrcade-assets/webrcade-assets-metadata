Dodgem is a shareware, single-player game in which the player navigates their spaceship over the surface of a planet avoiding some obstacles and collecting others.
The story to the game is that as a space miner the player has discovered a planet rich in the ore of a precious metal, Orindum. The only way to mine it is to skim to the surface which means some nifty flying is needed to avoid 'mysterious natural barriers'. The game has seven levels and in each the player must collect five pieces of ore, i.e. crash through the yellow blocks while avoiding all others. The game can be controlled by keyboard, joystick, or mouse.
