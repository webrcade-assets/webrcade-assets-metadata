This fast-paced 3D shooter is intended for VR headgear (although it can also be played without it).  Even under DOS, it offers specific support for 'period-correct' 1990s headsets (Forte VFX1) as well as more modern ones (Oculus Rift DK1), but any brand/model should theoretically work as long as it can render stereoscopic images side by side.  Using an abstract stripped-down graphical style, the action takes place in a cubical grid.  The player controls a yellow triangle who's being menaced by a squadron of squares; player and enemies alike can move through the playfield in six directions.
The pointy protagonist shoots backwards and forwards simultaneously, and your score rewards are higher if you can zap more bad guys with a single shot.  The enemies will unrelentingly chase you around the screen and do their best to hunt you down - and every few seconds their movement and spawning speeds are kicked up a notch, so your survival becomes a tougher proposition rather quickly.
