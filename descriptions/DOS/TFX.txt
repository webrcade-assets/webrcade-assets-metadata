TFX (Tactical Fighter eXperiment) is a flight simulation where the player can fly with F-117A, Eurofighter 2000 or F-22 Superstar in various scenarios as a UN fighter pilot. Before the player begins his/her duty, there is a need to complete 10 training missions. Only then will the rest of the possible game modes be available. The game also contains a mission editor where the player can create his/her own missions in any of the chosen scenarios.
