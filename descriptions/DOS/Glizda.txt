Glizda (meaning 'worm' in Polish) is a Snake / Nibbles variant with multiple innovative features. The player controls a snake that moves around the playing field (which does not exceed the size of a single screen) and grows longer as it eats various food items that are lying around. Unlike the basic Nibbles, these food items do not appear randomly on the screen but are all pre-placed, and a level is complete once the snake eats all these items (each worth a specified amount of points depending on type/appearance) and navigates to the exit before the countdown timer reaches zero.Additionally, the game introduces other elements that make it more puzzle-like, including impassable walls that can transform the playing field into a maze, and blocks which the snake may push around to open up passages or create extra bonus items worth additional points when two blocks are pushed together. There are also special items that produce various effects when picked up, such as permanently decreasing the snake's length or temporarily granting the ability to move through solid walls.Glizda comes with 50 pre-made levels split into five episodes 10 levels each, as well as a level editor and an episode editor for users to create their own campaigns (up to 100 levels). The game was available as a free download from the author's website alongside the entire source code.
