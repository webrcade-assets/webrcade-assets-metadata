Kurt's Spaced Invaders is a single player, shareware clone of Taito's Space Invaders. The objective of the game is to achieve a high score. The player has control of a canon at the bottom of the screen and must successive destroy waves of advancing alien ships. There are three lives in this game, so if a canon is destroyed there are two replacements available. The game is over when an alien ship reaches the bottom of the screen and lands or when all three canon have been destroyed.The game has a high score table, and it is played via keyboard. The shareware game has just two customisation options which allow the player to toggle the sound and the shields can be togged on or off.
