Hex is a computer translation of the strategy game of the same name: a 11x11 grid of hexagonal cells makes up the four-sided game board; each of the two players (black and white) is assigned a pair of opposing sides. The white player moves first, and both challengers take turns placing pieces on the board. To win, either player must form an unbroken sequence of pieces connecting their two colored sides. Hex may be played human vs. human or human vs. machine, plus a demo mode which lets you watch as two machine opponents match wits with one another.
