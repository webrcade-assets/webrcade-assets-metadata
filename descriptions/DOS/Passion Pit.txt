Passion Pit is a 1988 update of Drive-In, one of the first erotic text adventure games, originally written for the Commodore 64. Like the original, this is a work of interactive fiction where you use two-word commands to navigate a first date scenario at a drive-in movie theater with the end-goal of "scoring" with your lovely date. To do so, you have to navigate around the theater and the car, solve a few simple puzzles, and seduce your date.This version, written by Alan Pilon, purports to be less sexist than the original 1982 version, and includes color, a new title screen, and a few other small improvements.
