Egyptian Solitaire is a 1-player card game for DOS.
The player uses a standard deck of cards, and 22 cards are positioned face up in a pyramid.  Only these cards exposed on the bottom are available for play.  Cards higher in the pyramid can only be played when lower cards have been removed.  Remaining cards in the deck can be player 1 at a time.  The goal is to remove cards in combinations of 1, 2, or 3 cards that add up to a score of 13.  Victory is eliminating all face up cards from the board.  Cards have an ancient Egyptian theme, and the game can be played by mouse or keyboard.
