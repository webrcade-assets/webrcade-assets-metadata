Balduin: Run for Fun is an advertising game for the German health insurance company Techniker Krankenkasse. In this game, players control the penguin Balduin navigating an obstacle course within a set time limit. To build up speed, players must quickly press two buttons, which also determine the penguinâ€™s position: left (A+S), middle (S+D), or right (D+F). The penguin can jump over obstacles, but each collision with an obstacle delays progress for a few seconds. Players can choose between an easy or hard course at the start of the game.
