A business simulation which puts you at the helm of a petrochemical conglomerate, where your only goal is to increase your fortune by dealing in oil.  You may choose to head the company for 1 to 10 years - each game turn represents half a financial year, and allows you to buy domestic and foreign oil, release it to refineries, review your profit/loss and net worth, manage your cash reserves, carry out investments and trade in the stock market.To expand your business, you can put your hard-earned petrodollars to work by purchasing additional wells, refineries and gas stations, by investing in R&D (to increase production efficiency), or by paying lobbyists.  Debt may force you to go into liquidation, while equipment failure may result in pollution and fines... not to mention such annoyances as strikes, union disputes, oil spills and hostile takeovers. And if the nice boys at the IRS bust you for tax fraud, you may even find yourself in jail!
