Facts In Action is an early multimedia educational quiz game for one or two players. It can be controlled by either the keyboard or the mouse.
After selecting the kind of game to be played, the player(s) are shown a 5x5 grid of picture tiles and a voice announces 'Look for ...'. The player whose turn it is selects a tile and if they are correct they are rewarded with a comment like 'Wow! You're sharp', a short animation within the tile and a basic fact or two. If they are incorrect the game announces 'No! That is a ...'.
Correct answers remove a tile from the screen, revealing part of a picture underneath. When all tiles are cleared a short animation of that picture plays and the game can be played again.
The shareware version of the game has just four categories: Prehist. Animals - which is all about dinosaurs, World History, Basic Science and Spanish. One odd feature is that the game can be played with one, more or all categories in play.
