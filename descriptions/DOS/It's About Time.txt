It's About Time is the second of Softside Magazine's Adventure of the Month published for multiple systems.
You stumble across a strange device in your neighborhood, which turns out to be a time machine. You learn that in the future, the world will be destroyed by Henry Bowman's B-Bomb. The player must travel to a number of different times: 3032 AD post-destruction, 3031 A.D., the present (1983), the 1700s, early America, 200 B.C., the Stone Age, and prehistoric times, to stop Henry Bowman from ever being born, and saving the world from fire.
The player must explore these numerous time zones to seek out the truth of Henry Bowman's relatives. The player then must find a weapon, and extinguish his ancient relative, thus preventing Bowman from ever being born, and saving the future.
All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.
