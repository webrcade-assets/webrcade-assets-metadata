PC Galaxy Wars is a clone of the game Galaxian. The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen firing up, while enemy ships move back and forth above. Every so often, an enemy ship or group of ships will detach and travel to the bottom of the screen while firing. Once they reach the bottom, they return to their positions. Once all enemy ships in the wave have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next level.
