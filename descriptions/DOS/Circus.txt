Circus is an educational game for children of 6-8 ages, getting familiar with the basics of digits (from 1 to 10) and arithmetic operations (compare, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This process is achieved by animated questions asked by the circus performers, while the player selects the answers in digits, ranging from 1 to 10. Juggling and goalkeeper arcade games are also present for fun.
