A demoscene-flavored adaptation of the Peg Solitaire puzzle: a board with a cross-shaped arrangement of holes, some of which are occupied by pegs. The only legal move is to 'jump' a peg over a neighboring peg into a hole at the other side, which clears away the intervening peg. The board is solved by removing all pegs except one; if all valid moves are exhausted before this happens, you lose - and have to start over. Poof offers ten levels of play, each with a different initial board layout.
