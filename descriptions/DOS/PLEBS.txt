PLEBS is a Blitz / Air Attack -style demolition game with a twist. As per the convention, a bomber zips back and forth over a group of structures, losing altitude with each pass across the screen. The player's task is to time the dropping of armaments, to ensure the buildings' speedy destruction before the bomber descends low enough to crash into them. In this particular case however, the condemned buildings are robot factories, and they're still churning out robots...more precisely, Publically Licensed Electronic Burden Shifters (PLEBS).
These mechanical nuisances keep moving until they encounter an obstacle, and can climb on each other to create piles that slowly become a growing danger to air traffic. The PLEBS stream forth from the factories until the robot generators are destroyed. To deal with PLEBS and buildings alike, the player is given two types of weapons: squashers (an unlimited supply), and Super-Squashers (one or more, depending on the mission) for more extensive damage. Once a factory is squashed flat, the action moves on to the next one, and the player is given a password for the new level.
