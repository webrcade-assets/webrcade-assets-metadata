Blockade is a variation on the TRON -inspired Light Cycle concept, for 1 or 2 human players - computer-controlled rivals can join in for up to 6 players in total. Each player's objective is to block the others' paths with the trail left behind in their passage through the playfield - without running into their own trail, other players, or the boundary wall.A round is won when all opponents have been blockaded. Players are then scored according to their placements, and the next round begins; the first player to reach 100 points wins the game. Some parameters may be adjusted, including game speed, disappearing trails (for eliminated players), and the behavior of AI opponents.
