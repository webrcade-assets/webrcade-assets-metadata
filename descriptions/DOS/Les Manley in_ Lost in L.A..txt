In the sequel to Les Manley In: Search for the King, Les is searching for his best friend Helmut the Human Bean who, along with his girlfriend LaFonda Turner, has been kidnapped from his mansion in Los Angeles. Helmut and LaFonda are not the only ones who disappeared. Recently many celebrities have vanished without a trace and without any ransom note from possible kidnappers.
Unlike the first game in the series, this game is a "point and click" adventure. There is no text parser involved but instead the player uses the mouse pointer over the on-screen objects, so they become highlighted with a question mark. Clicking on them pulls down a simple menu consisting of possible actions that can be undertaken with the objects. Items collected in the inventory are operated exactly the same way but they can not be combined all together - they can only be used with objects or people on the location (including the Les' character himself). During the conversation with other characters, the player has several dialogue lines to choose from. However, since the game is very linear, there is no possibility to fail the game by conducting the conversation in a wrong way. Later in the game the player will have control over two characters.
The game combines cartoon graphics with digitised simple animations of filmed actors and actresses. The latter are mostly used as cutscenes or during the conversations.
