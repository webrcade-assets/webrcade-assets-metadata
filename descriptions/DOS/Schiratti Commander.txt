All of the above can be printed
The user can also use Schiratti Commander to edit scenery files to add mountains, buildings, trees, roads etc as well as new navigation aids. There are two ways to do this, one is through the wireframe GUI interface, the other involves programming in the Scenery Maker language
Finally, the package allows up to five pc's to be connected so that one player can take the role of Air Traffic Control and give directions to the others

In 1997, the product was updated to 'Schiratti Commander Gold', which was also compatible with MS-Flight Simulator for Windows 95, retaining most features of the earlier version 1.0, except for the multi-PC connection feature which did not work anymore.
The 'Gold' version also included 100 new objects to use in the design tool.
A Gold upgrade was freely available as a downsized download (lacking the 100 extra objects, and upgraded New Delhi & Budapest scenery) to registered owners of the v1.0 release, or as an orderable full CD upgrade, including the new design objects and scenery.
