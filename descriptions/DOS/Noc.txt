Noc (Polish for night) is an adventure game. The player takes on the role of a hero whose mission is to find lost friends in another reality. To complete the task the player has to travel through the dreams of the friends. At the start a hero can be selected who sets off on a rescue mission. The player can choose between a hacker and a butcher, with a focus on intelligence or strength respectively. Except for the process of opening the doors, the character choice does not further influence the gameplay.
The control mechanism is similar to the LucasArts SCUMM interface. Actions are performed by selecting the appropriate commands at the bottom of the screen and then pointing the cursor on an object located in the environment. The game contains some violent scenes. The CD-ROM version is enhanced with animated cut-scenes.
