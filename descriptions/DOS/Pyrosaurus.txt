Build and train a team of fire-breathing dinosaurs, then send them into battle against teams designed by other players.
Building a dinosaur is done through various sliders, like vision distance, neck turning speed, size, or fire color. This is made fair through a point system; better stats cost more points, and there's a limit on points. Training is programming a simple AI to move and fire in specific ways.
Once you're happy with your team, you can send them into battle. (The official servers are no longer active.) Pyrosaurus had asynchronous multi-player, where the battles would be simulated on a server, and the results returned for analysis. By doing well, other arenas would be unlocked with different designs and higher point limits. While the first battle would be free, there was a per-fight fee afterwards.
