Simulmondo's Spider-Man is an Italian series of games that were originally distributed through newsstands, and...e ora, Carnage! ("...and Now, Carnage!") is the second episode.
Gameplay is similar to the previous episode Il ritorno di Hobgoblin. It is mainly a point and click adventure game, where you collect and use items, talk to people, and solve some puzzles. There's also side-view platforming elements, although this episode in particular doesn't feature any action fighting.
