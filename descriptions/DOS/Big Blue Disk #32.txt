This issue of the PC software subscription contains three games: Darts, Block Five and Boxzum. Another noteworthy inclusion is Alfredo's Mortiferous Mentality, part of a popular series of non-interactive and darkly humorous animations. These programs, along with a variety of applications, utilities, clip art and articles (including a review of Life and Death written by John Romero), are accessible from a scrolling, text-based menu.
