Portal of Worlds 2 is the sequel to Daniel Eriksson's first adventure, Portal of Worlds. Like the first game, it is a very simplistic text adventure in its gameplay. You walk from screen to screen, and each screen provides you with a list of actions to choose from. Simply type the number to perform the action. In most cases, only one of the different options progresses the game and the others are useless (examining the surroundings, for example, usually doesn't reveal anything of note).
