Playboy is a single player, menu driven & text based game which can be controlled by either the mouse or the keyboard. This is a Czech game which plays in Czech, there is no English language option.
The player takes the role of a male protagonist who tries to get as many girlfriends as possible. Game-time is measured in days, not real time, so the player meets girls in different places and they eats out, go clubbing etc, the more girlfriends the player has and the longer he/you can hang onto them the more points are scored. Each potential girlfriend has her own preferences and requires a different strategy. As the player acquires more girlfriends the becomes harder as the player is unable to visit them all and, naturally, one girlfriend cannot see the player with another.
In addition to attracting girlfriends the player must also work on maintaining their own attractiveness and skills as well as earning money , legal and illegal options are available.
