This game entry reflects the original public domain release of Brix. For the reworked version by Epic MegaGames, see here.In Brix, the player is presented with an array of pieces, which he can move horizontally, and when two or more of the same type touch, they disappear. The goal is to do that to every brick of the same geometrical shape painted on it, and fast, because time is running out quickly. When the player has an odd number of a particular piece, three of them must be removed by ensuring that they make simultaneous contact.Unlike the "remake", this version has 112 levels, no difficulty settings and features a level editor.
