Microsoft Windows is the first multi-tasking operating system by Microsoft.
Included with Windows 1 is a single game: Reversi. Reversi is a no-nonsense adaptation of the popular board game Othello. The player plays against the AI. There are multiple skill levels at which the game can be played.
Player and AI take turn placing one of their tokens (red and blue) on the field. The token may only be placed adjacent to an existing token. If a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of any number of same-color token is closed in by the other color, the row changes color. The player with most coverage when the board is filled wins the game.
The game uses vector graphics that scale along with the size of the window it is played in.
