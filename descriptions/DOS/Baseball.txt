This computerized variant of baseball - itself based on an older BASIC adaptation from 1973 - delivers the sport to your computer screen using nothing but text.  The computer and the player get to manage rival teams, and flip a coin for the home position.  All input consists of numbers: when the player's team takes the field, possible throws for the pitcher are numbered 1 through 7 (fast ball, curve, slider, sinker, change-up, knuckleball, screwball).  When the team is up to bat, possible actions are 1 through 4 (batter takes pitch, batter swings away, batter bunts, lead runner steals - if one is on base).  The results of each move are described on screen, and after each half-inning the scoreboard is updated.
