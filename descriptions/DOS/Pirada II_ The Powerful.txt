Pirada II: The Powerful is a shareware card game. It is one of a trilogy of games, the others being Pirada I: The Fearless and Pirada III: The Invincible.
In this game, the player attempts to form poker-style hands out of five sets of five cards each. They can replace any cards, as many times as they like, but each replacement costs money, as does each new deal. The game helpfully tells tells the player both of any current hands, as well as any potential hands that might be formed out of the cards dealt if the right cards show up. After the player is confident in the hands created, they hit Stand, at which point they get money for each poker hand created, and a new set of cards is dealt.
There is no save game feature, nor is there a high score table.
This game was originally available only via registration of Pirada I, but was later released as Shareware as well. There are no restrictions on the Shareware version.
