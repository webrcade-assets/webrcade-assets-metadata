Dyno-Quest is an educational game for multiple systems.
Donnie's report on dinosaurs is due today, and he needs to find facts on one more dinosaur. Join Donnie and his dog Doobie as they blast off in the time ship 'Kaboom', travelling back in time to get facts about dinosaurs.
The player must travel to three different time zones from 100, 150, and 200 millions years ago to meet different dinosaurs. Each zone has 5 different geographic areas. When the player meets a dinosaur, they must properly feed them either vegetables or plants depending on their likes, and as a reward will receive a fact about the dinosaur for their report. After receiving five facts, the player can meet the final dinosaur who will provide the sixth and final fact, allowing Donnie's homework to be completed.
The player has a limited supply of fuel for their adventure, which reduces with all actions, and it's game over if the player runs out of fuel before completing their adventure. The player's ship can become damaged by encountering storms, fires, or volcanoes, which require time to repair. Some areas are empty when visited. If the player encounters a creature which is not a dinosaur, they can be rewarded with bonus fuel, plants, and meat.
