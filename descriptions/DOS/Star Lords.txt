Star Lords is a two-player turn-based strategy game taking place in a 3-dimensional space, with planet & star system battles of attrition taking place between the two forces. A player moves troops from one of their planets through hyperspace, with the number of turns taken to reach a destination based on the distance travelled.If the destination is unoccupied, the planet can be colonized, which lets it produce new troops each turn. If the planet is occupied by the opponent, a battle of attrition takes place, where the larger force wins and the loser is annihilated. (There is also an alternate rule set where a complete loss is avoided, and the loser withdraws to the home base). Different planets have different amounts of troops produced each turn, so selecting which planet to conquer or defend is a tactical choice.The back story tells of Earth vs Rebel forces battling over the total control of the game area; this can be played in several scenarios, either from scratch where each side has control over one star system and has to travel to other stars in hyperspace to expand their dominion in order to gain more troops - or with six pre-set distributions of the empires holdings, in various balanced, offensive or defensive positions.  The games objective is to conquer the home planet of the opponent.There is no AI player, the game is intended for two human players only.There is no resource gathering or production other than the troops themselves.All commands are given as x/y/z-coordinates and single letters for giving orders to the troops to embark/disbark/move the troop ships.
