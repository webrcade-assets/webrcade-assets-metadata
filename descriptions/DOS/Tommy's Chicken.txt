Tommy's is a single player, shareware game based on the fun pastime of playing in the road with the traffic.The player controls a chicken and the object is to cross a four lane motorway or, more accurately, to cross and re-cross and generally fool around because in this game points are scored not for crossing the road but for how long the player can survive in the stream of traffic. When the action becomes too intense the player/chicken can take a break by resting on the lane markers but points are deducted for doing this.As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
