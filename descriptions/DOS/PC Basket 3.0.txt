"PC Basket 3.0" is the third instalment of the "PC Basket" saga, a series of inexpensive managerial / basketball simulators that Dinamic Multimedia sold through newsagents throughout the 1990s.It offers an updated (as of 1995) database of Spanish basketball teams and an improved version of their basketball simulator. The most attractive game mode, though, is playing a whole season as the president of any of the teams, and controlling aspects such as the hiring of new players.
