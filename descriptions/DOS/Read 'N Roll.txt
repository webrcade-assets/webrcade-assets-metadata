Read 'N Roll is an educational game that is meant to improve the player's reading comprehension skills in five areas: recognizing the main idea, recalling facts, identifying the sequence of events, drawing inferences and building vocabulary.The game consists of five activities. The first four (main idea, facts, sequence and inferences) all work in the same way with the player first having to read a passage of text and then answer a question based on it. For each question there are four alternatives and the player gets two attempts to pick the right one. After answering twenty questions the player gets a score that is based on the number of correct answers and the number of attempts.The fifth activity, Strike 'N Spares, is a bowling game where the player has to define words in context. A sentence is displayed with one word highlighted and the player has to pick out the correct meaning of the word from four alternatives. When answering correct a bowler will appear on the lane and move left and right. When in a good position the player presses a button and the ball will be launched. The game then works like a real game of bowling with the player attempting to take down as many pins as possible.The program also contains an editor that allows the user to create new reading passages and questions.
