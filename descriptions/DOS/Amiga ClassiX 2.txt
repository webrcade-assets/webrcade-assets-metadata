This compilation of ~250 Amiga games contains various Freeware, Shareware and Public Domain titles, including various recreations of popular titles for C64 and other platforms; only a few games were specifically licensed as full versions.On Windows the games can be started directly using a pre-configured version of WinUAE, on Amiga the ADF disk images can be copied to a floppy disk using the included ADF2Disk application and started from there. According to a pop-up dialog it was also possible to order an Enhanced Amiga CD where the games can be started directly from CD.Not pro-configured, but also included are Amiga emulators for Acorn, BeOS, DOS and MacOS, and more operating systems are supported in combination with Emulators Unlimited 2. Also included is a licensed Amiga OS 1.3 and 3.0 Kickstart ROM (but no Workbench).The disc provides a HTML overview with a screenshot and short description for every game, split into several categories. According to the manual and HTML listing the disc includes below 285 games.At least the "Retro Interactive" re-release is missing some images, resulting in a total number of only 228 included games; the missing games are marked with a ∅.ActionAce the Space CaseAlien Bash IIAstrokidBlitz BombersBomb ManiaBrutal HomicideBrutal Homicide 2CalippoCharly the MercCyberman ∅DieDithell in SpaceDithell's WonderlandDynamite WarriorsEvil Insects 2Fire PowerHelicopter MissionHideousHot Air ∅IntenseIntense 2James BondKnights ∅Macho KillersMariettoMaster BlasterMostares 2MuhtarNo Man's LandOrk Attack ∅Plat ManPugglesRageRevengeSanta and RudolphSnoisnemidSound the Space CadetSuperball ∅Super Bubble RemixSuper ObliterationTeddyTraitorTurtleminator ∅Wheelbarrow SimulatorWingnuts ∅Wizards of OddWolfpac ∅Zombie Apocalypse IIAdventureBackstageBeneath a Steel Sky (German; English version has to be bought separately)Bifi - Snack ZoneBifi 2 - Action in HollywoodBloodfestCastle of DoomThe Child MurdererDragonslayerDungeon HeroEvil TowerThe Island of Lost HopeThe Legend of the ElvesLord of AlcandriaLost on Parrot IslandMadhouseThe Adventures of Maddog WilliamsMoriaMuscarine, or: Erica's TripNo Mercy 99SkyworkerSpace Tribulations ∅Telekommando 2ThrallboundVictor LoomesZergArcadeAmiganoidAztec ChallengeBagitman ∅Bandit ManiaBondmine 12Brik FighterBruce Lee ∅Charon 5 ∅Darts 501Deluxe PacmanDenver DukDiamond CavesDiamond Caves IIDonkey Kong ∅Drip ∅Dropzone ∅Dual Paint ∅Emerald DashFlash FloodFrantic FreddieGringosHigh Noon ∅Hyper DriveJouster 3 ∅Lactose IntoleranceMad Bomber 2ManiacballMaze Man ∅MegafruitMissile CommandMonster MazeOverlanderPacman 96PatiencePengoPlay Pac ∅Poing 6Polataa 5PopcornPucman WorldsReel SkillSkiddy ThingsSneechSpace Taxi 3 ∅Sproing!SuperballzTechnology 2The Winning PostTorch 2081TrailblazerWilly Worm and his Bunny AssaultWormout 2097Yeti ∅Beat 'em UpArt of breaking headsBarraventoE-SwatFighting WarriorsMortal Kumquat IIIThe Legend of the Exploding FistTroop JugernortPlatformAunt Arctic AdventureBanana IslandsBilly BurglarBounceCrazy SueCrazy Sue 2Cross CountryDiamond ChallengeDr. StrangeFayohFayoh 2FurballHoi ∅Kick ItKlawz the CatLabyrinth 2 ∅Monster BusinessObsticklePhuk the World ∅Rise of the RabbitsRise of the Rabbits 2Roach MotelSony GameSuper Bob DylanSuper Orange ManTony & Friends: in Kellogg's LandTop Hat WillyTricky Quicky GamesWibble World GiddyWizioWiz 2Puzzle6tris ∅Amiga Crossword Deluxe ∅AmiWale ∅AntsAtomsBoat ∅The Challenge of the MatrixCoin ManiaConnect 4 ∅DoktorDonkey IIDragon CaveDr. MarioGardeningGemZGeorge and the Repton CloneGiger Tetris ∅HirnrissImperial ∅Infection ∅JazznicKnottyMarry AM Pic ∅MinefieldMinehunter Deluxe ∅OhmPacomix 2Panic ∅PetrisPop Up ∅Premier PicksPuzzo Mania ∅Quid ∅Same GameSeahaven 2000Solition ∅TetrasTetris ProThink A ManiaTile FallToobzWB Perplexity ∅Workaholic ∅Racing5.4.3.2.1.0 ∅Aerial RacersBattle TrucksDream Cars ∅High OctaneInternal CombustionKnockout 2 ∅Leading LapMoose DriveRacing ManiacsRoad to HellSpod RacerTurbo Challenge ∅Shoot 'em UpAmoeba InvadersArazmaxAssimiliationAsteroids 2 ∅A-TypeBotss 3 ∅Bratwurst ∅CroinsCybernetixDeluxe GalagaFatal Mission 2Fire FlyFire Wall ∅Ground Wars ∅InvadersInvaders 2Kelly XLethal XcessLiberatorMotorola Invaders 2 ∅OffenceOutlinerPee BeePoweroids ∅RotonSpace InvasionSpace WarSpectrumStarbirdsTMA ∅Total ExcessTurbo Raketti 2Turbo Thrust ∅WaponezWitnessXenexYoung DefenderZaxxonZiriaxSportKaramalz CupMr. Men OlympicsRicochetRoll or DieSeven Tiles ∅Tie BreakStrategyAir WarriorAmpuCG Risk ∅Conquest RemixFantasy ForcesFederationFrontal AssaultGlobal Thermonuclear WarfareHannibalHB Monopoly ∅Hilt: Against the HoardesHilt 2Lords of WarPorts of CallScorched TanksSiege of the BeastSpace M.A.X.TanxTask ForceUfo Enemy Unclothed ∅Unlisted, but included:DawnVideoPokerTrick Or Treat
