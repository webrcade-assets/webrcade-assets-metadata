Topspeed 300 is an arcade-style racing game that resembles The Need for Speed and has fully texture-mapped 3D environments and objects. The player controls the car via keyboard or joystick and can switch between cockpit view and several external cameras.
There are three different fictional cars to choose from, and four different tracks. Only single races against one AI opponent are available, the opponent's car can be also selected by the player prior to the race.
Author Andreas Pollak created Topspeed 300 as a project to test his custom 3D engine. The game is distributed as freeware and is available in the English and German languages.
