Kent Knutson is a teenager who lives in the city of Neutropolis. The city is controlled by a totalitarian regime, which prohibits people to express any emotions that would deviate from the prescribed norm - such as joy and happiness. Kent is arrested by the Norms, the police force of Neutropolis, and put in prison for whistling a merry tune. In prison, he received an anonymous note that tells him that there is a resistance group somewhere in the city, which seeks to overthrow the dictator of Neutropolis. The question is - how can Kent find that resistance group?..
Normality is an adventure game done entirely in 3D, similarly to Under a Killing Moon, though with more colorful, cartoon-like visuals. Besides the somewhat unusual (for the genre) engine, the game plays like a traditional puzzle-solving adventure, primarily relying on manipulation of objects Kent is able to pick up and put in his inventory.
