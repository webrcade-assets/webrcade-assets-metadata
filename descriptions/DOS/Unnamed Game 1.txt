Unnamed Game 1 is the beta version of an unfinished game which was released as freeware on the developer's website. The player controls a space ship (viewed from behind) which can be moved freely in all four directions. Asteroids and other ships enter the screen and move towards the ship. The goal is to shoot as many of them as possible to earn points. However, every enemy contact causes the ship to explode and one of three lives is lost. When none are left, the game closes.
