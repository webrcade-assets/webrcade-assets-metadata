Segyun-jeon is a board game similar in concept to Reversi and notable for being the first game with VGA graphics released in Korea. The player competes against an AI opponent, each controlling blue or red blob-like creatures on a grid. The opponents place blobs on squares in turns with the goal of "capturing" adjacent enemy blobs and turning them into their own color. A stage ends when all the blobs have been turned to the same color. Unlike traditional Reversi variants, each stage has different starting formation, and is distinguished by various difficulty levels.
