The notorious Dr. Thanatopsis Dread, to lend credibility to his bid for world domination, has employed devious means to convince the world that grand American accomplishments (1492-1905) are actually the work of his distinguished ancestors. The mysterious Benefactor has invited YOU! to join a crack team of whiz kids in his subterranean lab at Sea Cliff Manor to help restore the historical record to the (more-or-less) legitimacy we know today.
Playing much like an enhanced remake of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?, this game will see you wearing a rut in the virtual floor of Sea Cliff Manor, beating paths between Amanda's room (with its TimeLine machine, to establish when s), Josh's chamber (featuring the GeoFax, to get a better sense of where), and the time-traveling booth of a robot cat, who conducts and then projects interviews gotten back in the timestream to help get a fix on the biographical information regarding who was at the heart of the contentious event.
The game features abundant in-game help, lavish production values, compelling cut-scenes and scores of easter eggs.
