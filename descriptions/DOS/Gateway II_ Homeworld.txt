A huge, strangely shaped object was spotted just outside the orbit of Pluto. Scientists dub this object "The Artifact", assuming it to be a spaceship possibly connected to the mysterious alien race, the Heechee, who have disappeared without a trace, leaving only ships with cryptic destinations behind. Meanwhile, a terrorist sect is planning to use The Artifact to lure in the Assassins, an alien community bent on destroying other species. Eventually, a sole explorer reaches the enigmatic ship, only to discover traces of former Gateway prospectors . This leads him to believe that something might be malfunctioning at the very core of the Heechee civilization.Gateway II: Homeworld is a sequel to Gateway. It is the last adventure game by Legend Entertainment to use text-based input, after Companions of Xanth introduced a purely graphical engine. Its interface is identical to that of Eric the Unready : while most commands can be either typed in or selected from a list combining verbs and available objects, conversations with characters are handled by choosing pre-set topics and displayed on separate screens. The game also features some animated cutscenes.
