Tommy's Roulette is a single-player, shareware roulette game.
The player can only place a limited set of the standard roulette bets, up to six individual numbers, odd, even, high, low or one of the 'dozens'. There are no pairs, groups of three, four or six, no neighbours, no red or black. They start with $100 and can continue playing even when they run out of money. The cumulative score is saved in a work-file which can be erased thus resetting the player's cash score back to $100.
As with all of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
