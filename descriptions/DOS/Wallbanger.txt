Wallbanger is another ball-and-paddle game that follows the Breakout formula and gives the player a paddle, three balls, and a bunch of bricks to break. This binge of structural destruction driven by striking the flying ball with the paddle, bouncing it off the sides and into the three rows of bricks across the top. It is possible to control the ball's course somewhat by bouncing it off different sections of the paddle. If all three balls fall through the bottom of the screen (without being deflected by the paddle), it's game over; if you manage to tear the walls down completely, you'll be awarded the prestigious title of "wallbanger" - only to start again with zero points, since the game ends after a single level.
