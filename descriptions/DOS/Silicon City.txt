Silicon City is a digital paradise that holds Earth's entire population. The only problem are the viruses. Somehow they have affected the incubators, the devices that create new people, and have turned them into virus creation engines. That's where you come in. You have been given control over the response to these viruses; the same devices that create viruses can also create antiviruses. Seek out and capture all the infected incubators, and destroy all the viruses.Silicon City is a one-player turn-based strategy game. Starting with a single incubator, which will create a new antivirus every few turns, you need to explore the map, finding and capturing other incubators to increase your forces, and fighting viruses. There are multiple levels to the map, connected by wormholes. Combat is strictly rock/paper/scissors-style. There are three types of unit: scouts, which are fast, will always defeat powerful units, but are bad at capturing incubators; normal units, which will always defeat scouts; and powerful units, which are slow, but are good at capturing incubators, and will always defeat normal units. Victory is determined by gaining an overwhelming advantage in victory points, which are generated per turn from incubators.Silicon City was distributed as Shareware. The Shareware version lacks the random map creation of the full game, it only has a static map.
