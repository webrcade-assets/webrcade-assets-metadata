The Starship Commander's Tactical Battle Simulator is, as you might expect, a starship battle simulation, taking obvious inspiration from Star Trek. (In a non-trademark-infringing way.) Ships can fire on other ships with disintegrators and antimatter torpedoes, use transporters, tractor beams, launch drones, change headings, and adjust power levels.
It comes with multiple scenarios, with different ship combinations and objectives. The shareware version came with three scenarios. The registered version came with 10 other scenarios, with the option to order another 10 in a separate package, or a scenario editor.
