E.S.S. Mega (European Space Simulator Mega) is a space shuttle simulation using 3D-modelled graphics. The game features one long campaign that emphasizes micro-level decisions (e.g. how much fuel to carry) over macro-level space program policies. You will first equip the space shuttle with cargo, crew, and energy. Then you will launch, pilot, and land it on a “shuttle carrier”. When your shuttle is safely orbiting Earth, you will send up and maintain satellites, build and manage a space station. The in-game space database provides information.
