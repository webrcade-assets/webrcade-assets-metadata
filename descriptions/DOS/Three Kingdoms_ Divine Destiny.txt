Three Kingdoms: Divine Destiny is a Korean-made real-time strategy game heavily influenced by Command & Conquer. The names of the countries and their leaders are the same as those of the historical Chinese Three Kingdoms era; however, the setting is completely fictional and fully futuristic, including advanced firearms, vehicles, and robots. Only Liu Bei (kingdom of Shu) and Cao Cao (kingdom of Wei) are playable; Sun Quan of the Wu kingdom is only introduced in the expansion pack.The gameplay closely mimics the Command & Conquer style, including a similar point-and-click interface. The player constructs building, manages units, and uses mining vehicles to extract minerals from the ground. The game's stand-out feature are individual hero units, with the leader's personality and attributes affecting the unit's performance in battle.
