Apples and Floors is an arcade-style game with 4 screens (similar to Donkey Kong). You are Happy Harry, and you need to use ladders, elevators, and moving floors to traverse the current level while avoiding the "Big Mouthed Meanies". Scattered throughout the level are 12 apples, and you must eat all 12 apples in order to free a prisoner that is in imminent danger of being blown up by a rocket.Although this game runs in MS-DOS, it is intended for the H/Z-100 computer and may not work on an IBM PC.
