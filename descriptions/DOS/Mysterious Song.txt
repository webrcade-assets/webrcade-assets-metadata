Mysterious Song is an RPG strongly influenced by the style of the early Final Fantasy games. Your character is a knight, sent by the king to investigate the trouble arising in the land, with the help of two other party members whom you pick up as you travel. The combat is turn-based, with a very simple magic system based on spell points. One party member is a mage, one specializes in physical combat, and your main character is a mix. There is no class selection, only leveling up.
