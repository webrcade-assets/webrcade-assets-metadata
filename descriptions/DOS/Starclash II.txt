Starclash II is a space-themed exploration and conquest game, and the sequel to Starclash.Two players, or a human and computer player compete for control of the galaxy.  At the beginning of each game the player sets up the galaxy, including number of systems from 2–20, depth level from 1–58, and starting number of planets from 1–3.  The player can access range tables and detailed planetary data. Each turn, each planet makes a set number of units.  These units can be told to move to different planets, and movement takes a specific number of turns depending on planet distance.  If the player moves units to an opponent-controlled system, then combat occurs for control of the system.  The first player to eliminate all enemy ships and planets is the victor.
