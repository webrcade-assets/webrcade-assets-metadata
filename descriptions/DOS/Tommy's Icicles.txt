Tommy's Icicles is a single player, shareware game.
In this game the player takes the role of a character, pun intended - just look at the graphics, who's stuck in a cave with a hose pipe. To move in any direction the player has to point the hose in the opposite direction. The hose fires ice cubes which stick to the walls of the cave and to other ice cubes, hence any movement will gradually fill the cave with icicles. Staying in one place isn't an option either because an icicle will grow towards the character as soon as the game starts.
The object is simply to stay alive as long as possible which means avoiding all contact with ice which results in death and game over, the longer the player stays alive the more points they score.
As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has nine levels of difficulty, basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
