This compilation contains various Amiga games, game demos and demoscene demos, playable both on a real Amiga and via emulator.
The disc is split intro three sections:

FULLGAME (48 entries), containing both Commercial & Public Domain / Freeware games
GAMEDEMO (199 entries), containing demo versions of several popular games of the time, some of them presented as coverdisks of several magazines.
MEGADEMO (98 entires), containing various demoscene demos.

Using the disc on a real Amiga some of the entries of the FULLGAME section (see list below) can be started directly. All the other games - contained as ADF disk images - can be copied to a floppy disk using the included ADF2Disk application and started or installed from there.
On Windows the disc provides a graphical menu, providing an (incomplete, see below) list of above games and demos. Games can be started directly using the included Fellow Amiga emulator, the GUI also provides a basic interface for its configuration. Alternatively it's possible to start an 1.3 Amiga Workbench using a pre-configured version of WinUAE, with the Amiga section of the disk readily available.
Not pre-configured, but also included are Amiga emulators for DOS, MacOS, UNIX and Windows, more operating systems are supported in combination with Emulators Unlimited 2.
