ALF, a furry alien who for fear of discovery can't really leave the house, is Vision Software's choice to teach children about the wide range of geographical features found in the United States.
Lesson one: A multiple choice quiz to test knowledge of geographical terminology.  Hosted by ALF, who fires a cannon (!) containing your answer choice at a bucket.
Lesson two: ALF quizzes you on the names and/or capitals of states highlighted on a map of the 48 contiguous states (the packaging claims this lesson covers all 50.)
Lesson three: ALF now quizzes you on landmarks' locations.
Lesson four: a simple timeline of the admission of states into the union.
Lesson five: Allows children to make a personalized print-out of events with historical and personal relevance.
