Think-3d tasks you with defusing all the explosives in a building by surrounding all the explosives with dropped concrete cubes.
Think-3d is a timed Minesweeper -style game as a falling block game. Single blocks will fall from the top of the playfield, (closest to the player) and the color they turn when they hit indicates the number of explosive blocks in the eight adjacent squares. The objective is to reveal every block in the floor without hitting any explosives. If explosives are hit, the floor is lost, and play moves one floor closer to the player. If the top floor is lost, the game is over. If all squares are revealed, the floor is completed, and play moves one floor away from the player. Completing a floor also provides a clue as to the location of the control center. This is a square on one of the floors that controls the explosives in the entire building. Destroying that will complete the entire building, and play will move on to the next. But the square is marked as an explosive square, so you'd better be certain before making a move.
There is also a shop that can be entered during gameplay. This allows the purchase of special blocks using points. These range from marking an explosive, to providing a hint, to revealing all explosives on the level.
Think-3d was distributed as Shareware. The Shareware version lacks a high-score list, and some special blocks cannot be purchased in the shop.
