Carey DeVuovo's Hollywood Mogul is a business simulation about a Hollywood movie studio. The player buys (or creates their own) screenplays, sets the production/market budget, hires staff (screenwriter, actors, etc.) and hopefully creates a masterpiece - or at least a financial success. There is not much else to the basic gameplay process except juggling multiple of these projects at once. Additionally the player can buy a company jet or luxury goods (real estate and art) from their personal account.
The DOS and Windows 3.x are functionally identical, but the Windows version uses photos instead of drawings for the background pictures.
