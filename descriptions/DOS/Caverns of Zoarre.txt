Caverns of Zoarre is a dungeon crawl role-playing game similar to Telengard. You may choose to be either a fighter or a sorcerer as you explore the multi-leveled caverns for gold and treasures. Your view of the maze like caverns is top down, and only the area near you is visible. Throughout the caverns are many different types of enemies you'll encounter; you can try to bargain or run to get out of trouble, or fight and use spells to defeat enemies. You can also optionally enable real-time fighting instead of turn-based. As you explore and (hopefully) win battles, you'll earn experience points and increase your skills. Good luck on your quest!
