The Misadventure of the Holy Grail is a comedy text adventure that takes inspiration from the 1975 movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. You play the role of a knight in the time of King Arthur, and your task is to recover the Holy Grail. Along the way you will meet up with other knights, explore forests and castles, and face various dangers. If you are killed, you are sent back to the starting location, but the game is not truly restarted: you still have the same inventory items, and so on.
