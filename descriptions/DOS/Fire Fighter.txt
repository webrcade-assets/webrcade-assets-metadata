Playing a bit like the reverse of Pyro II, this game puts the player in charge of a forest fire response team, combating the spread of flare-ups into timberland and cabins using three fire-fighting tools: water Drops, Firebreaks, and Backfires, all of which work with varying success depending on the regard to the wind speed and direction. The layouts of flashpoints, cabins and fire-thwarting lakes is randomly generated with each game; a high score is assigned based on how quickly the player is able to control the total damage inflicted by all fires.
