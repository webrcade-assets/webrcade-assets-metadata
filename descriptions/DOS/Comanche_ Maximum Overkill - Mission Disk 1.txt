Comanche: Global Challenge is the first add-on to Comanche: Maximum Overkill. It adds three new campaigns with 10 missions each, some of which are significantly harder than those in the original game. Also added are new terrain types including arctic and desert and new enemies: The Mi-24 Hind helicopter, the BRDM-3 APC and the Scud-B missile launcher.
