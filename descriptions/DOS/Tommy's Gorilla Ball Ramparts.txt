Tommy's Gorilla Ball Ramparts is a single-player DOS game. The player takes on the role of the defender of a castle. They can move left or right along the top of the screen. Along the bottom of the screen are enemies who are trying to storm the castle. They move left or right and at random points they erect ladders to scale the castle walls and they can also shoot arrows.
The player defends the castle by dropping cannon balls onto their enemies and by cutting the ladders they erect. Arrows can be dodged or deflected by a shield. Any enemies who make it to the top of the wall must be killed before they have chance to fire an arrow and kill the player's character. The game has nine levels of difficulty and records the top ten scores for each difficulty level.
