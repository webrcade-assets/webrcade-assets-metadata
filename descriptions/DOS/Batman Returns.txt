Frigid winter winds swept over an already chilled Gotham City. Random street crimes were running at an all-time high,despite the holidays. Down below, in the city's frozen sewers, Oswald Cobblepot, known as The Penguin, planned more mayhem and schemed the take over of the frightened metropolis. His loyal army of missile-packing Penguin Commandos and the bizarre Red Triangle Circus Gang are energized by the evil genius of the web-footed orphan. A desperate call to Batman goes up.Batman Returns is an adventure game with fighting sequences (controled using attack icons of equipped weapons), based on the movie of the same name. Control Batman's combat style, and help conduct relentless interrogations of The Penguins' many allies. Use the Batcave computer to input clues, analyze evidence and review enemy bios. TV news is available in the Batcave as well as in the Batmobile and broadcasts important information that is crucial if it comes to figuring out where to go next in order to find another lead. You're in charge of weapons, too. Stock Batman's Utility belt with enough heat to match the diverse fighting styles of The Penguin and his cold-blooded, sewer-dwelling minions.The game is divided into several days during which some events happen. The player has full control over the moment when the day should end. In order to complete the game, the player has to gather enough evidence before the Penguin will be elected for the mayor.
