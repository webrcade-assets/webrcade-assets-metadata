Loosely inspired by the story of Prohibition-era mobster Dutch Schultz and his buried millions, this game sends you down into the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine to locate and blast out a lost treasure, stashed away in a randomly-generated maze. Unfortunately for you, the mine is infested with rats and spiders (which drain your health), as well as bats (which steal your items... and when you're out of things to steal, drain your health).
As you roam the tunnels from a first-person perspective, items in your inventory will prove essential, ranging from dynamite and a 'mazer' gun to navigational aids like a map, a compass, night-vision goggles and a gold detector. The chosen difficulty level determines how well-equipped you are: you may start with all of the above, or hunt for them yourself throughout the corridors.
