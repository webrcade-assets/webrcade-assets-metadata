Bomb Squad is a Minesweeper game: uncover a grid, where each square marks the number of adjacent mines. This one is in text mode, but still has mouse control. There are multiple difficulty levels, which don't change the size of the field, but the number of bombs that will be placed onto it (10-50 or random). Fastest times are recorded for each difficulty level.
For those used to the Windows version, this version doesn't ensure that the first square uncovered is safe, and doesn't let the player uncover all adjacent mines with a left + right mouse click, but it does automatically reveal adjacent spaces whenever there are 0 adjacent mines. It also doesn't stop you from clicking on a mine you've marked already, ending the game. Finally, the game ends not when all possible spaces have been cleared, but when all mines have been correctly marked.
This game was released as Shareware, but without restrictions.
