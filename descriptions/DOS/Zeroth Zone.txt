Zeroth Zone is a Scramble variant. Your goal is to get your spaceship across 6 zones (starting with zone 5). On the way, you encounter missiles that should be avoided or destroyed, and you have to watch out: you do not want to bump into walls or to run out of fuel. The game is a classic side-scrolling view, and your ship is controlled with arrow keys: it can drop bombs downwards or shoot missiles forward.
