Bubble Puzzle is the original Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble variant that eventually became Bubble Puzzle 97. The main differences in this version are that the ball-launching cannon may not be moved on the horizontal axis, and the initial arrangement of bubbles at the start of each level is generated randomly.
The core playing mechanics remain the same: connecting three or more bubbles of the same colour clears them from the screen, along with any other bubbles connected to them but not to any other bubbles. The "ceiling" to which the bubbles are ultimately attached descends slowly, and if any bubble crosses the red line at the bottom, the game is lost.
Bubble Puzzle was distributed as "letterware": the authors requested no charge and allowed to redistribute the game freely, but asked users to send e-mails with feedback (a questionnaire was included).
