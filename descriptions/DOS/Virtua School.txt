Virtua School is a "school simulation" text adventure where you assume the role of a new kid at school and have to deal with all the problems teenagers usually have to deal with. Make friends, get good grades, and score with the chicks! It's a pretty simple "gamebook" style game where you're presented with a list of actions, which then lead to different consequences. The game keeps track of your number of friends, enemies, the money you have, and your grades.
