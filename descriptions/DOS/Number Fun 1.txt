Aimed at pre-school/kindergarten ages and up, the four number games in this release provide a variety of ways to solve simple number problems. "Munch" requires navigating a Pac Man -like figure to the correct answer and eating it. "Tiny Bomb" involves typing in answers to multiplication, addition or subtraction problems before the fuse burns down and the bomb explodes. "Ozzie Koala" requires navigating a koala to the correct answer and pointing at it. "Bomb" is much the same as "Tiny Bomb" but introduces division problems as well. Each game lets you choose a difficulty level, allowing various skill levels to be challenged.
