PlayMaker Football unites three distinct modules into one game program. First, there is the Team Draft to "build" the team you need to best run your styles of offense and defense. Each player on the 30-man active roster (15 offense and 15 defense) has five ability categories: Speed, Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Discipline. Each player can have up to 100 points assigned to each of the five categories.Next there is the Chalkboard Editor. Here you will build your playbooks, designing offensive, defensive, and special teams plays. Each playbook can have hundreds of plays, allowing you to prepare for any contingency. You can also try out each play on the Practice Field option so you can check the timing on pass plays, blocking schemes, coverage assignments, pass routes, and blitz angles.Finally, its time to play some football!  You can let the computer call your game plan for you (based upon detailed Artificial Intelligence settings that you build into the playbook), or you can take charge and manually make all the calls in real time or play in an online league by uploading your playbook for use against a specific opponent.PlayMaker Football is not an arcade style game -- it is as realistic and detailed a simulation of football as you can get.
