Microsoft Hawaii is an official scenery enhancement for Microsoft Flight Simulator. When this product was released hard disc space was at a premium so there are two installation options, one which installs the entire scenery package and a minimal install which required the CD to be loaded when the player wants to use the scenery.It adds hills and textures to the landscape together with twenty six airfields. A couple of airfields such as Honolulu International and Midway Naval Airfield were present in Microsoft Flight Simulator however the airfields installed with Microsoft Hawaii have buildings and more runways.The package also installs ten Flight Simulator Situations which include flying a glider in Maui, a biplane through Wakiki's skyscraper hotels, landing on the Nimitz and viewing the 1983 Kilauea eruption.
