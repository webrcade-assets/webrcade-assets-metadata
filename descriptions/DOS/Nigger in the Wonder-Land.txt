Obviously aiming for maximum offense, this game stars a racially-stereotyped caricature of a black man - whose apparent concern is the pursuit of sexual relations with a pair of (fair-skinned) buttocks.  This tantalizing tooshie moves up and down the screen in evasive patterns; if our protagonist misses the mark, he will suffer a fatal meeting with the electric fence beyond.If he does catch up with the disembodied derri√®re, the ensuing act is rather more bizarre than what the player is led to expect.  After this, it's on to the next level, which speeds up the action some more.
