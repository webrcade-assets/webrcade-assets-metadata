The Battle on the Black Sea is an adaptation of the Battleship board game, representing a fictional conflict between Russian Federation and Ukraine for the domination over the Black Sea after the U.S.S.R. collapse. Rather a parody of the collapse situation, the game puts the player in the shoes of the Russian fleet commander on his campaign to conquer the Ukrainian ports. You can only play for Russia. The goal is to destroy the Ukrainian fleet on the Black Sea, capturing four ports. There are two fields in the game â€“ yours and the enemy's, each is 10x10 game cells, you can see all the ships on your field, only those that managed to be wounded on the enemy's. Before the battle, the ships must be placed. As in the classic game, there are four types of ships: four torpedo boats (single-deck), three destroyers (double-deck), two cruisers (three-deck) and one battleship (four-deck) on each side. The fewer shots you have fired before victory, the more successful your result in the battle is considered.
