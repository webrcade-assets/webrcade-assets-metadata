Animated Clock is an educational game for learning how to tell time. It has five modes:

Practice lets you set an analog and digital clock to the time you want, in order to see what a time looks like on both.
Multiple Choice displays an analog clock and asks you to select the matching digital time from several options.
Analog to Digital displays an analog clock and asks you to type in the correct time.
Digital to Analog displays a digital clock and asks you to move the hands on an analog clock to match.
Cuckoo Clock displays the current time on both an analog and digital clock.

All modes except Practice and Cuckoo Clock let you select a difficulty of 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes, or 1 minute. For example, at 15 minutes, all times given will end in :00, :15, :30, or :45. Every time you correctly answer a question, a small animation plays on the clock. If you complete a section by answering 10 questions, a longer, more complex animation will play, then return you to the main menu.
The game was distributed as Shareware. The registered version had more animations, and could be personalized with your child's name.
