The Electric Crayon series was a very easy to use computer coloring book. Each entry in the series had about 30 pictures to color.Pictures could be colored from a palette of 16 colors. A mix button would "mix" the current color with the 15 other colors... give a total of 256 colors. Choosing a color and clicking in the picture would do a color fill in the area clicked. This was the first "computer coloring book." The finished, or in progress, coloring was automatically saved to disk. When this program was developed "color fill" algorithms were excruciatingly slow, a special algorithm was created that performed a high speed color fill.Pictures could be printed with, or without, a monthly calendar.One of the first games to support the mouse and color printing. "Fun on the Farm" had 30 pictures of farm life.
