The Ripple That Changed American History! is a single-player history teaching game.A ripple is travelling through time distorting American history, and the player must listen to American historical events from 1775 - 1975 to track down its location. Using a time machine, the player can use the rip scan to attempt to track down the current date of the ripple, and use the voice amp to listen to voices from the era and the location where the ripple is located. The player can then travel to the location where they believe the ripple is located, but the ripple is often changing location. There is 120 minutes to hunt down the ripple, and every action uses time.
