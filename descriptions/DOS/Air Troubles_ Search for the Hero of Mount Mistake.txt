Air Troubles: Search for the Hero of Mount Mistake takes place on Mount Mistake, where the best pilots gather to determine who truly reigns supreme. In this two-player game, each participant controls a propeller plane, engaging in aerial combat to eliminate their opponent. The battle unfolds on a single-screen, presented from a side perspective. Pilots maneuver their planes using four buttons: two for acceleration and deceleration, and two for ascending and descending. Alongside the standard cannon, players can select one of eight secondary weapons. The victor emerges after winning five rounds - either by downing the opponentâ€™s plane or because the other plane crashes to the ground.
