The Patrician is set in medieval times, focusing on the trading efforts of the Hanseatic League. The player (and up to 3 other players) struggle for money and respectability. They build up sea routes between the 16 cities in the North and Baltic Sea, and the ultimate goal is to be governor of their hometown. For this, they need to acquire a lot of money and high respectability. The game ends when a player is elected to Ã„ltermann - the highest rank in this century.Money is earned by buying goods cheap and selling them for higher price. With the profits, new ships (out of 4 different types) or stores can be bought. There are also pirate battles, for which ships must be armed with weapons.
