This is an interactive fiction game with graphics, although the graphics are loaded and shown separately from the text interface. They usually show up when Stone enters a new location or uses the "look" command. The player interacts with the game by typing in commands, e.g. "take box", which is then interpreted by the parser and followed by a text response. The game is spent with exploring the environment, picking up items and solving puzzles.
