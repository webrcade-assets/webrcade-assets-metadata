Kalli & Co. is an advergame that puts the player behind the steering wheel of a Volkswagen Golf. The goal is to drive down a road as far as possible. To make this task harder the road is filled with obstacles like oil slicks or balls rolling over the street which should be avoided as any contact with these means the end of the run instantly. Additional four-leaf clovers can be collected by driving over them awarding the car driver with extra points. After the race, if the result was good enough, scores can be entered into a high score list.
