Euijeok: Im Kkeokjeong, more commonly known as Legend of the Seven Paladins, is a first-person 3D shooter set in feudal Korea (China in the originally developed unreleased Taiwanese version), and the first commercially released game using the Build engine. The player can choose to control any of the seven available characters, all of which are warriors specializing in various weapons such as swords, flails, maces, as well as unarmed combat. Each character starts with a default melee weapon, but can acquire and use ranged weapons such as darts, throwing knives, etc. Health pick-ups and temporary power-ups are available as well. Enemies are medieval warriors or demons; most of them use their own weapons or cast magic. On several occasions switches must be manipulated to access certain areas, and traps must be avoided.
