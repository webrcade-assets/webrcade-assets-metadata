Mission Supernova is a shareware adventure in German. The player is "Horst Hummel", the spaceship's chef de cuisine. Usually this would be a job without much stress, but when you wake up, the whole crew is gone. You're alone on board.
The game is a classic point & click adventure. It features a verb-based interface very similar to early LucasArts games, e.g. Zak McKracken or Maniac Mansion. Like in those games, gameplay mainly consists of exploring rooms/scenes, collecting various items and solving puzzles. Some items can be combined to form new items, and most of the puzzles require clever use of collected things. From time to time, talking to other characters is also necessary, which involves choosing among different dialog options. Some scenes have a time limit, and it is also possible to die or get stuck in various ways.
Scenes are rather static, there is no scrolling in rooms. The main character itself is not visible in game, somewhat similar to Myst, although the perspective is not really first-person. You can interact with items at the other side of the room without actually moving there.
Mission Supernova is split into two episodes. The first episode was available for free, whereas the second one had to be ordered for money (shareware model). Meanwhile, both episodes can be downloaded for free.
