In Duracell: Run the Bunny the player travels the solar system in search of the Duracell Bunny mascots. On each planet the player navigates around a maze collecting items, while activating electronic items to get past obstacles. The goal is to collect two drumsticks, a drum and a battery and then bring them to the Duracell Bunny before proceeding to the next level. The controls at the bottom allow the player to skip or back a level as well as game configurations. In between levels, the player can interact with the cutscenes.
