Liu Zhang Majiang is an adaptation of the multiplayer tile game Taiwanese Mahjong. The most significant distinction from other mahjong variants is that players receive 16 tiles instead of 13. The core of this game is the story mode: The protagonist, chosen from 16 male and female participants, is tasked by their master to venture into the city and hone their mahjong skills. The master provides a starting capital of 12,000 yuan, which can be used to participate in regular mahjong matches or one of three gambling variants. Winning matches rewards experience points and eventually allows players to level up. However, players must also correctly answer two rule questions. The ultimate goal is to reach a high enough level to participate in the mahjong tournament.
Outside of the career mode, players can also engage in single matches, a tournament, and a tutorial mode.
