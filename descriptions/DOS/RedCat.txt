This is the first game in the Redcat series. It's very different from the later educational Redcat games aimed at children. In this game you play as Redcat, who sets out to retrieve the stolen treasure from the mice.
The game has 10 levels in total. In these levels you will be killing different kinds of mice with your sword, bombs, a machine gun or a flamethrower. You will also be picking up money on your way to the final level, which will make your score go up. There are a number of traps set up throughout the levels as well, like spike pits and blocks that will crush you.
