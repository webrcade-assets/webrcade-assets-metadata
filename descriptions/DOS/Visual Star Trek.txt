The United Federation of Planets and The Klingon Empire are at war. Your mission is to annihilate Klingon presence from the known galaxy. Visual Star Trek is a turn-based strategy game based on the classic Star Trek games like Super Star Trek and EGA Trek. Unlike its predecessors, Visual Star Trek features a mouse-based GUI. After selecting the difficulty and the number of turns, you'll start your Klingon hunting by clicking a location on the map, which shows you the planets, star bases and the like, but does not show you the Klingons before you make the jump.When the battle starts, you need to manage your shields, phase cannons, photon torpedoes and the all new experimental death ray that literally is a planet killer. If you destroy your opponents before the end of your turn, great â€” if not and you'll get beaten up, there are usually some star bases nearby where you can replenish your energy and weapons. Other than battling it out with Klingons, there are also Romulans and Tholians flying around, blackholes with nasty gravity, randomly appearing supernovas and planets where you can harvest either useful resources, or, if you get unlucky, tribbles.At the start of the game the player can determine the difficulty through one of the six military ranks. Blackhole gravity, tribbles and random supernovas can be disabled. The gameplay screen shows a detailed overview in the top left corner, a quadrant overview in the top right one, various options on the right through a HUD, and text messages about the events in the bottom left corner.
