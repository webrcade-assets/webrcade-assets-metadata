Noddy's Big Adventure is an edutainment game aimed at children aged 3-7 years. The game features characters from Enid Blyton's Noddy books and TV series. There are seven mini-games within the game. These are a memory game (Tricky Trees), a reading game (Bert's Scrapbook), several matching games (Can You Find Me? and Noddy's Kitchen), a math game (Noddy's Scales), a sorting game (Beach sorter) and Picnic Attack, which is not intended to be educational, where the player squirts water at crabs to keep them away from the food. The games are linked together via a world map where the player can drive Noddy's car from one activity to another, as well as picking up and dropping off passengers (which serves no purpose in the game).As a bonus feature, a Noddy themed word processor is included allowing the player to construct stories using a combination of words and pictures. The balance between relying on the pictures, and an increased emphasis on using words varies depending on the difficulty level.
