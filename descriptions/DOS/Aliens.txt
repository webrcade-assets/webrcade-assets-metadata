Aliens is a horizontally-scrolling shooter. The player takes control over a soldier with a jetpack who faces a lot of alien opposition. The soldier is moved over the screen with the mouse (without animations) and shoots enemies with a machine gun. Unfortunately ammo is limited and when it runs out, the soldier is completely defenseless. The game is over when all health was depleted by touching enemies or their projectiles. The goal is to earn enough points for the high-score list.
