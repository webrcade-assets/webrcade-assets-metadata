Sextris is one of the infinite versions based on the original Tetris (or more concretely, a softer version of the contemporary Porntris). As it's name suggests, this game is directed at a mature audience. This is because this version contains several erotic images with celebrities on them. These images will -initially- appear in a covered way as the background of each level, but will slowly be uncovered as you complete lines. A level is passed once the image is fully visible. As the player advances the blocks will fall faster and faster and sometimes the game will even start with some blocks already located on the screen.
