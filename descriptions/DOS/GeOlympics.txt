GeOlympics is an educational, shareware, geography title comprising three parts; The game and the factual content of this title are based on an earlier product known as The Great Arc II*. The main screen shows a world map and contains all the functionality of that program in which the player selects two cities and the program calculates a line between them that continues on around the world to form a circle. This, and its associated functions are used in planning multi-leg journeys.

GeOlympics, the game referred to in the title, is a single player quiz game that is accessed by clicking on the five ring Olympic symbol on the right of the main screen. There is a three round practice mode but the aim of the main game is to locate twelve randomly selected cities from either their name, a description or clues. An example from the game's documentation says the city of Detroit can be identified from the following description"'Motor City'; RenCen, Silverdome, Greenfield Village".
Questions are timed, the player has ten seconds to click on the city's location on the world map and they have three attempts per turn.

Finally there is ArcEdit which, as the name implies, is an editor that allows the player to change existing cities or add new ones.
