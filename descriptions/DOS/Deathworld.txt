Deathworld is the ninth of Softside Magazine's Adventures of the Month for multiple systems.
You have been in space for 2 months travelling at a hundred times the speed of light. Earth has long ago diminished into the vast darkness of the universe and now your journey is about to end. Your destination is Alpha Beta II, a small planet at the fringe of The Milky Way. Your compatriots Brent, Reeves, and Jackson ventured to this planet on a mining expedition. Shortly afterwards, signals and communication ceased. You have been sent on a solo rescue mission to discover what happened to your lost compatriots.
All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.
