Space Battles contains four different games on one disk: Space War Moon Lander Meteor Shower*: In this game numerous meteors are falling! Your goal is to guide your character and collect as many of the pieces of the scene as you can. When a meteor falls it will remove any pieces of the scene that happen to be in its way causing you to lose points. If you collect a piece before it's destroyed by a meteor you gain points. If you are hit by a falling meteor then you lose a life. The goal is to earn as many points as possible. One to four players can compete for the highest score.

Space Zombies : In this game your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting dots on the screen. Four opponents bounce and wander around the screen; if you get caught a life is lost, and the game ends when all players have lost all their lives. One to four players take turns playing the game and compete for the highest score.
