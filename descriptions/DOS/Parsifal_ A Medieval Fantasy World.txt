Parsifal is a turn-based strategy war game with fantasy elements in a medieval setting.
The game lets the player take on the role of Parsifal, the leader of the 'good' side (using red coloured troops) versus Archon, leading the 'evil' side (the blue troops) in a campaign to retrieve seven pieces of a holy grail, which will restore peace to the region. In addition to the regular troops, there are allies in the form of amazon-type archers and opposing goblin hordes aligned to the evil side, plus wizards, dragons, bears and spiders to watch out for.
