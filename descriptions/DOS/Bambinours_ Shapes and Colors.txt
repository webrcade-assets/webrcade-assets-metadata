A very simple game for little children of three to eight years of age. Its purpose is to teach a child to recognize shapes and colors: there is a double entry grid on the screen, with columns designated by different colors, and rows designated by different shapes. The task is to place pictures of objects of a certain shape and color that appear one by one on the right side of the screen to a corresponding place within the grid.The settings let you choose between five languages, as well as between 12 grid types and 14 object types.
