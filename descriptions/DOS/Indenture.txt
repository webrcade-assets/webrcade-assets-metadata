Indenture is a variant of the Atari 2600 game Adventure. Your goal is to return the golden chalice to the yellow castle. In your way are locked castle gates, a bat, and several dragons who would like nothing better than to eat you alive. Just like in Adventure you start out at the yellow castle gates and you must navigate your way around the game's maze like map in search of the chalice. The player character is represented by a yellow dot.
Gameplay and visual style in the game are rather simple. You control your character via the arrow keys and pick up objects like keys, bridges, and the sword by walking over them. However you can only carry one object at a time. The author has added two more game variations to the older game's three. Game 4 has 300 rooms, if you can discover the secret to unlocking them.
