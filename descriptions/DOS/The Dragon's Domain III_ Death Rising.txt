Following the hatching of the dragon eggs in The Dragon's Domain II: Restoration, the hero has grown old and weak, the magic chalice has been lost, and the dragons have been raised as undead by an evil wizard. But the red dragon has grown up, and is willing to help. Help him find the chalice, the flask of magic water, and the wand.
The Dragon's Domain III: Death Rising is an action game heavily influenced by Adventure. As in that game, you explore a maze of screens to find keys, and fight dragons and other monsters.
