The Age of Dragon is a vertically-scrolling shooter. The player controls a dragon who must battle through multiple stages, each of which ends with a boss. The dragon has three fire modes that can be changed at will: a straight shot, a more spreading shot, and homing missiles. These power up with usage, but being hit decreases their power again. Additionally, being hit has the disadvantage of decreasing the dragonâ€™s health, and running out of health means game over. There are unlimited continues, but using them always respawns the dragon at the start of the current level.
