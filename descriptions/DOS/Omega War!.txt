Omega War! is a single player Asteriods style game, with gameplay based on Omega Race. This game however dispenses with the asteroids and just has the alien spaceships to destroy.
The game is entirely keyboard-controlled, and allows the player to adjust the start level, the game speed, and the number of enemies on screen at the beginning. It also has optional sound.
