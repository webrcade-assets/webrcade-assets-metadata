Yacht Racing Simulator is a sailing simulator where players take control of the sailing vessel Australia II with the goal of winning the America’s Cup for Australia. To achieve this, players must outperform the vessel Liberty (which can also be controlled by another player).The game is presented from a top-down perspective, displaying the entire sailing area without scrolling. Players can lower or raise the three sails (mainsail, jib, and spinnaker), adjusting their tension as needed. Additionally, players can choose from nine rudder settings. These settings, combined with wind considerations, dictate the ship’s movement. While players are limited to making one rudder and one sail adjustment per update of the position console, they can queue up orders.
