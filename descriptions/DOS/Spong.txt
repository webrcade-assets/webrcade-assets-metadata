Spong is a simple, shareware, two player, keyboard controlled version of Pong.
There is no change in the game play of the original game. Spong continues until one or other player gets bored and quits at which point whoever has the highest score wins. There is no sound, no high score screen, no save game function.
What this game does have is VGA graphics, five game speeds, and three optional levels of randomness. When randomness is introduced the ball makes sudden and unpredictable changes of direction often right back at the player who last played it.
