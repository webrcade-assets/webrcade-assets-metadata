One of the best Interpol agents, John Pollack, must solve the mystery of a series of thefts. Ancient artifacts have disappeared from all around the world, and rumor has it that Joachim Wardner, a former CIA employee, may be involved.Tajemnica Statuetki (Mystery of the Statuette) is a point-and-click adventure game composed entirely from photographic backgrounds, lacking any animation, thus requiring a lot of "pixel-hunting" by the player. The game features verbose descriptions of the items and characters, puzzles and dialogue options for conversations.
