Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97 is an updated version of Sensible World of Soccer: European Championship Edition. The only addition are the updated team rosters.While the Linux/Macintosh/Windows are just the emulated DOS version, the Xbox 360 has some genuine changes: online multiplayer, updated graphics (the graphical style and the top-down perspective are kept) and dynamic advertisements. The team rosters are still based on season 1996/1997, but the names are not authentic anymore.
