On the distant planet Chromos, the Drullian people fight the forces of Skynet-Titan, an AI out of control.
The player has to lead the Drull armies to victory in several battles with different goals.
Battle Isle is a turn-based strategy game played out on a hexagonal overlay on a map with different types of terrain. Multiple types of units can be produced, of varying strength and abilities that are used to attack each other.
The screen is split in two, one half for each player. While one player moves units, the other can decide where to attack and vice versa. Battles are then played out between turns and victorious units gain experience.
There are 16 levels to play against the computer and another 16 for two player competitive play.
