In the near future, gangland crime runs rampant. And you and up to three other friends are fighting to become the boss of the criminal underworld in a small city. You must commit various crimes, such as burglary, pickpocketing, robbery, kidnapping, assassination, and smuggling to climb through the ranks. Each type of crime has a minigame attached to it, be it tactical fighting, item pushing puzzles, breaking a code, sneaking past guards, or running through halls, trying to stay away from the cops. Eventually you will command up to 9 other gangsters to help you rise to power.
Crime Fighter can be played by up to four people at the same machine, though a single player mode is available as well.
