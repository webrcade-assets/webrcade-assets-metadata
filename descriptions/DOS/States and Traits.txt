States and Traits is a 1 - 2 player American geography learning game for multiple systems.
Gameplay occurs on a blank map of America showing only rivers and mountains, or an outline showing individual states. Players can try to correctly place the outlines of states on the map, or can try to place a specific state trait on the map. The player receives more points the quicker they answer the question. Traits include: state names, historic facts, bordering states, capitals, current facts, or landforms. Players can create custom state traits.
