Sento is a one or two-player, keyboard controlled fighting game. It is one of the earliest VS fighting games that uses 3D polygonal models and environments. There are 4 playable characters, each character has a different weapon, like a hammer, battle axe, sai or katana sword.This game is set in Necrovania, the same game world as 47-TEK's other game Creep Clash, where a challenge is held at the stroke of midnight to decide which ghoul will be Necrovania's next lord. The battle takes place in a small arena-like area with the loser, more-often-than-not, falling off the edge into oblivion.
