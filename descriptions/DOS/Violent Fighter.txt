In the year 2073, in the city of New York, AMX Industries are engineering their newest product of super soldiers for the protection of the city. However the super soldiers Fireking, Kalamus and Megaclaw, break out of their stasis tanks, go maverick and begin to cause destruction around the city. With the police unable to stop the violent trio, AMX hastily mutates eight humans into super soldiers to combat them. The player selects one of the eight super soldiers to fight the other seven determining which of them can stop the violent trio. Each super soldier has his/her super moves in addition to standard punching, kicking, blocking and jumping. Each opponent must be beaten twice to win a fight. After the first seven opponents are down, the player engages Fireking, then Kalamus, then finally Megaclaw in three boss fights. There also exists a Practice Mode.
