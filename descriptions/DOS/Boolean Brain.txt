Boolean Brain is an adventure and strategy game for 1 player.
The player moves between a number of rooms arrayed in a grid, by moving north, south, east, and west. If the player has not moved between two rooms before, they must solve a small puzzle, where they must choose the correct pathway that solves the puzzle on the right. In the puzzle, each box only allows a single pathway through, and the player must choose the correct path in the minimal number of turns. The goal is to find the central processing unit before the player's data entirely degrades.
