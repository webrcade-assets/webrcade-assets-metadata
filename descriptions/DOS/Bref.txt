Bref is a Columns variant for one or two players. The titular Brefs are small funny creatures that take the place of the usual blocks from Columns, slowly descending by three from the top of the screen. To help Brefs "escape", the player must arrange them in groups of no less than three of the same colour, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.In addition to these basic mechanics, there are other items falling into the playing field that might yield either bonuses or, conversely, hamper the player's progress. The objective of each stage it to "rescue" a certain number of Brefs within the given time limit. Bonus points are awarded for clearing more than three Brefs at a time.Bref was originally sold as shareware, but the final version was made available as freeware. Shareware releases did not include the two-player mode and the hard difficulty levels.
