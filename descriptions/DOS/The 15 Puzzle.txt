The well-known sliding block puzzle game is honored with another computerized treatment, written in BASIC.  In keeping with the original concept, the 4x4 board is populated with tiles numbered 1 to 15 and one empty space - the goal is to slide them around and shuffle them until the numbers are arranged in natural order, with the blank tile at the bottom right.  The number of moves made is counted and displayed at all times.
