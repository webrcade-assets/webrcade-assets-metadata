The game simulates the 15 Puzzle, where the tiles are parts of a certain picture. These pictures are images of naked female celebrities (originally found in Playboy or similar magazines) or porno images of Smurfs. Square tiles are located on board in random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.
There are 45 images in the game. The celebrities include Bo Derek, Brigitte Bardot, Brigitte Nielsen, Cindy Crawford, Madonna, La Toya Jackson, Victoria Principal, etc.
