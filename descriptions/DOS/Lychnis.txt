Hundred years ago, a fearsome dragon nearly destroyed the entire world, but was stopped and sealed by Prince Grinstain of Bamas and the Royal Princess Respina of Pars, who used magical Hartinum equipment to defeat it. However, a malevolent sorcerer named Sakiski has appeared in the land of Laurasia, using the princess of Bamas in a cruel sacrifice to restore the power of the dragon. The young knight Lychnis and an apprentice magician from Pars named Iris are the only ones who can retrieve the hidden Hartinum arsenal and stop Sakiski.Lychnis is a Korean-made side-scrolling platformer. The player can choose to control either Lychnis or Iris; the knight fights with his sword and can jump on walls, while the magician uses ranged attacks with a staff and can double-jump. Some areas can only be accessed by a specific character.Enemies, treasure chests, and various items can be found in the stages. Enemies drop coins, health-restoring items, or other power-ups upon defeat. If a special "shop" icon has been collected, the player gains access to a store between the stages, which allows him to upgrade the characters' weapons and maximum health. With the exception of the final confrontation, there are no boss battles in the game. There is also no password feature or any other possibility to save the player's progress.
