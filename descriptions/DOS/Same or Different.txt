This is a very simple EGA game that displays a screen with four images  of random items and the child chooses whether all the images are the same or if one of them is different.  After answering YES or NO, feedback is given on correctness (if one image is different and the child answers incorrectly the image flashes on the screen to show them where the differing image is located) and the child then goes on to the next screen of images.  Ten sets of images are played through and the game ends with the child's score displayed.
