At the time of its release, this was the biggest-ever issue of Softdisk's PC software subscription, spanning two 3.5" or three 5.25" floppy disks. This was due to the inclusion of an extra-large typing program called Proto Type. This was not the only game in the issue, however; there was also room for Dungeons of Kroz and Squares along with the usual mix of applications, clip art, utilities and articles.
