You are a space fighter pilot defending a space dock from enemies. Enemies attack in waves; you can attack them with lasers. You will move on to the next wave once the current wave has been defeated. Gameplay continues until you either run out of ships, or the space dock is destroyed. You can earn extra ships during play, and both your ship and the dock have shields, but shields do not regenerate, and you only have the one space dock.
Enemies include mines (explode if you get close), regular ships (fly around and either attack you or the dock), and mother ships (extremely powerful).
Spacekill I: Defenders is a first-person game. Gameplay takes place on a long, looping, section of space with asteroids and mines. Using the top-down map as a reference point, you can move up, down, towards, or away, as well as apply thrust to the left or right. The 3D view shows either the left or right hand side of the ship depending on the camera used.
Spacekill I: Defenders was distributed as Shareware. Spacekill II: Attackers was the second, registered-only, episode.
