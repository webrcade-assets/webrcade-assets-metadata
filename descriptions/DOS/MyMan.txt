MyMan is a text graphic remake of Pacman. Gameplay is simply the same as Pacman; you go around a maze eating all the dots, while avoiding ghosts. The maze has four flashing dots that make the ghosts edible when you eat them.  During the first levels the ghosts stay edible longer, but when the levels continue on, they are edible for a shorter amount of time. As you progress through a level, their will be a bonus fruit somewhere in the maze; every new level, the fruit is worth more than it was the previous level.
The characters in the game are made of letters.  For example, MyMan is a C, the ghosts are A's is enemy mode and m's in edible mode, and the fruits are made up as %, v, etc. When you lose all your lives you get a game over, and the game closes automatically, and there is no highscore.
