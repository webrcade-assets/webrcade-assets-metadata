Similarly DUU12C1 represents 'Do You Want To See One?'

If successful they win $100 and the chance to have an additional letter placed in the hard vanity plate displayed at the top of the screen.

The single player game dispenses with the preliminary rounds and consists of only the bonus round.The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
