WizardWorks continues two traditions with this disc, shoveling together user made levels for commercial distribution and naming their compilations "Retribution" (as with their Starcraft add-on).W!Zone II: Retribution contains over fifty levels for use with Warcraft II along with a copy of the Warcraft II strategy guide found on the first W!Zone disc.
