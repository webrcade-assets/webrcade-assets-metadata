Missile Attack is a Missile Command -style game. You defend a group of buildings from missiles that come down from the sky in waves. You place targets into the sky that the missiles will hopefully intercept and save as many buildings as you can. Your command center provides a radar. If it is destroyed, the cursor will not be visible. Further waves get faster and more difficult.You receive points for defending the city well: 12 points for each building left standing, 8 points for shooting down a missile, 2 points for unused anti-missiles, and a 150 point bonus plus a rebuilt building if you shoot down all missiles. If you get over 1500 points before all buildings are destroyed, you will be able to move on to the next city.Missile Attack was distributed as shareware. The shareware version does not have all cities, and has a registration reminder screen on exit.
