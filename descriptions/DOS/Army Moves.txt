Army Moves is a one-player arcade game divided into two parts. In part one, the player controls a jeep and must cross a bridge, avoiding enemy jeeps and helicopters. A second section involves an helicopter and the goal is to cross enemy airspace without being shot at by airplanes or any other ground fire. The player must then land on the pad near the end.In part two, our hero starts out in the jungle and must reach the enemy base without being blown to bits. Then he needs to locate the general's offices and steal the secret documents detailing a new neutron bomb.In all versions of the game part two is loaded separately and a password obtained after completing part one is needed to access it.
