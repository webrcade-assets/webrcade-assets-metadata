This compilation includes the Might and Magic games from the early 1990s:Might and Magic III: Isles of TerraMight and Magic: Clouds of XeenMight and Magic: Darkside of XeenAs bonus, the CD features the original fan-made program Swords of Xeen, taking place after the two other Xeen games. Among the ruins of Greyhaven a magic pyramid is found that seems to be the gateway to a new world. Nothing is known about the gate except that Lord Xeen used it often. Thus the Dragon Pharaoh sends the player characters out to see what threats lies on the other side and destroy them. The gate leads to Havec, a new world filled with new creatures and dangers. Swords of Xeen is a stand-alone scenario that uses the same engine and gameplay mechanics as the original games, but with the characters starting at a high level.
