In 2097, the mining of minerals and other natural resources is completely automated and controlled by supercomputers. The planets that are mined for 'Iberium', an essential mineral to control pollution on Earth, are called Z.A.R.; Zones for Artificial Resources. The 'central computer' that controls all of the mining robots is hit by a meteorite and enters a frenzy. It starts building robots with weapons, intent on conquering more planets. A single soldier, Colonel Hermit, is sent to deal with this threat.The mission objectives are rather simple, most often requiring the destruction of a number of installations or robots. Sometimes you will need to protect valuable cargo. Environments are diverse, including water-covered planets, deserts, volcanic areas, etc. Weapons and other bonus items are found on the planet surface. Jumping can be done using a booster or simply by using your legs. Hostile units move over water, ground, in the air and some even jump like a kangaroo.
