Space pilot Duke Skytripper finds himself stranded on a backwater planet, following a nasty encounter with some space rubble and a little too much beer (not necessarily in that order). Setting out across the landscape, he discovers that having a smouldering wreckage for a ship is the least of his problems: the green, slimy Martians are here, and they'd like nothing more than a group hug.As a Robots / Chase variant, MMFM! has a simple goal: get all the Muck Men killed before they get you. Each level finds Duke in an enclosed arena, with several gooey aliens for company. For every move he makes, the Martians will attempt to close in for the kill; if they're manipulated into colliding with each other, they'll drop dead in a lump of goo - which is itself lethal to the touch. To escape a sticky situation, the player may tempt fate by teleporting to a random point, or (once per level) use the napalm blaster to kill everything in close contact.
