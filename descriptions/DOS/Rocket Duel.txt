Rocket Duel is a two-player game where the players control rockets and fly around the battlefield, trying to shoot each other. Each rocket has a limited amount of health and the player loses when his health is completely depleted. On higher difficulty levels, the rockets can be destroyed by running into various obstacles around the map. The rockets can land on walls and ceilings. On lower difficulty levels, the rockets land automatically when they touch the wall but on the highest level, they must be aligned properly or else they will crash. The maps contain various landscape features that complicate gameplay, including water and mud that can be swum in, bumpers that bounce the rockets away, and sheep that can carry rockets around.Apart from regular one-on-one deathmatch maps, the game also contains "capture the flag" maps where each player must steal the opponent's flag and bring it to his base; on some levels there is only one, neutral flag with both players competing for it.
