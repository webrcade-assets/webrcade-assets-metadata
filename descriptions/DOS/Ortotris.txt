Ortotris is a Tetris variant. The game takes place in the same manner except that the player does not stack bricks but words. The player's task is to choose the correct spelling. The correct spelling indicated at the bottom of the screen needs to be selected from different choices by using the left or right cursor keys. The game highlights a part of the word the player needs to decide on. If correct, the selection is deleted, if not, it remains. On the right side of the screen displays the percentage of correctness of the answers. The game ends with the degree of exposure.The game has a mode of practice and theory of all types of polish spelling.
The Amiga version of the game and DOS v2.0 (released as a part of the Ortomania compilation) include the Ortowpis editor, which allows players to add new words to the dictionary.
