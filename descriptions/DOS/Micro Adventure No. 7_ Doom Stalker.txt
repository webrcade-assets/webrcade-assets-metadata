Micro Adventure No. 7: Doom Stalker is a novel and series of type-in BASIC adventures for multiple systems.
The world is headed for disaster!  Secret agent Orion, computer whiz of ACT (Adventure Connection Team) is on the job, and only he can stop the world from spinning wildly out of orbit.  Tidal waves and earthquakes are only the beginning.  The evil forces of BRUTE (the Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil) are bent on wrecking havoc by this malicious act, and it's up to Orion to set the world back on course.
Though the story, there are numerous interactive type-in programs that offer numerous outcomes. An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with many of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.
