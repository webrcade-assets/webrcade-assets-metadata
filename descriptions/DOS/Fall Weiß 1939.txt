Fall Wei√ü 1939 is a 2D turn-based strategy game with elements of the strategy board games, similar to the Panzer General series. It represents all the major battles of the September Campaign against Poland, referring directly to historical events that launched World War II. The game contains the original historical sounds and pictures, a huge number of reconstructed historical military units, described in the mini-encyclopedia, and a map drawn in increments of 1 square kilometer. A total of approximately 2,500 troops and more than 30 scenarios are available. Your troops are divided and are represented by icons on the board: as ruff, divisions or companies. During rounds you are able to move units, use air support and make preparations for supplies.
