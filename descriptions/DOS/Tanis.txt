Tanis is a graphical text adventure with a mouse-driven interface. The scenario is based on an older text adventure named Deena, created by E. L. Cheney between 1987-88. The player assumes the role of a female warrior who was captured by the evil Gendi, a monstrous race bent on subjugating the world. The player starts out in prison and has to escape before taking the fight to the Gendi.
Gameplay is similar to a classic text adventure, but instead of a text parser where commands are typed in, the player can bring up a list of available commands by pressing the space button instead, and then choose a verb with the mouse, followed by an object the verb should be used on. This streamlines the gameplay quite a bit, as it removes the "guess the verb" issue text adventures often suffer from. The game also has simple graphics displaying the room the player is currently in. Those graphics are completely static, however: if the illustration contains an item the player picks up, that item will stay in the image even though it's no longer there.
