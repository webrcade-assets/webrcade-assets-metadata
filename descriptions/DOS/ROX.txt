ROX is an Asteroids variant, where you pilot a spaceship and shoot asteroids and spaceships.The screen wraps around left/right and up/down, so what goes off the screen in one direction comes back from the other. You have three lives and unlimited ammunition for one session. If you clear the whole area, new asteroids are spawned off screen.
An enemy spaceship will periodically come and shoot at you, and if you don't avoid it or the asteroids, your ship is destroyed. The ship has a laser shooting forward, it can turn and accelerate, and there is an emergency warp, in case you get boxed in. If you are successful, you will end up in a Hall of Fame list, and some statistics will show for your next game.
