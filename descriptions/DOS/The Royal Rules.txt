The Royal Rules is an educational logic game and a sequel to The King's Rule.The player progresses through 4 levels of increasingly difficult logic challenges in an attempt to reach the kingdom. At each level the player encounters a guard, and the player is given 3 numbers, from which a mathematical relationship can be derived. The player has unlimited attempts to submit 3 numbers, and are told if the sequence fits the mathematical relationship. The player then reviews 5 number sequences, and must either give the next number or state if the sequence meets the pattern. If the player solves 3 problems correctly, they move to a new area and a more difficult challenge.
