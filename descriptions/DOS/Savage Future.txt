Savage Future is an action adventure (role-playing according to the author) game set in the far future (ca year 4537) in the land of Medigar, when the Furries are seen with mistrust, and even hunted by the humans, who are on the rise in the world. The world itself has undergone a nuclear holocaust, which has forced some humans underground, opened dimensional holes to demonic worlds, from which monsters are entering into Vor Terra, and as usual some people need others to blame, and the furries get to be scapegoats.The protagonist, Rolanfox, reappears from the earlier game The Darkest Night, in the form of a time traveller from the past (year 2457), following the trail of his disappeared uncle Yowler, the inventor of a time machine. The timetravelling uncle was trying to change the future to prevent the extinction of the furries, that some zealot humans were blaming for a draught, but somehow he got lost some 2000 years in the future, and now Rolanfox will try to find and rescue him, and possibly help prevent the extinction himself.The main game screen is presented as an overview map, where the player character is represented as a small red dot, moving around and encountering either random enemies to fight, finding various food sources or visit locations like human or furry cities/villages, underground areas, caves or towers.While all creatures met in the wilderness are hostile, in the villages and cities there are friendly or neutral locals to chat to, bar-room gossip to listen to and healers and shops to get help and perishable items from.Talking to the locals, you get hints on what to do to prevent the impending disaster, and where to go and what items you need to search for your uncle.The only weapon Rolanfox has is a gun - a contraption his lost uncle has brought back from his travels - which needs bullets, and while effective, these bullets must be bought in shops, for money.How to get money? Well, there are these zealot knights wandering in the wild, searching for furries to kill, and they are the only way to get money at the start. No other monster carries gold; but there are small stashes of money hidden in caves that may be found by wandering around fighting troll-like creatures, mutants from the past nuclear war - only you need to buy a light source to see underground, and possibly a map pointing out cave locations, so at the start you really need to bag these knights for their gold.The game is free, or donation-ware, and a second part was under development for release in 1999.
