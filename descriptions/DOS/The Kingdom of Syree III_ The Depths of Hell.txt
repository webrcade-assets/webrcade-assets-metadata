The third chapter in The Kingdom of Syree saga, The Depths of Hell continues the adventures of the Lord Champion of Syree. With the order in the realm reestablished after the new Keeper of Power is found in Black Magic, the brave hero decides to travel around and see the world. However this journey is soon interrupted by a messenger from King Telbor who demands the Lord Champion's immediate return to Syree, for a new threat has risen: hellish demons are invading the land of Sheol, and the gateway from which they come must be sealed to stop them.
The Depths of Hell is largely similar in visuals and gameplay to the previous chapter, Black Magic. It was also distributed as shareware, with certain quests locked in the unregistered version. Users who registered Black Magic would be able to use the same code to unlock the third game as well. Registration would also make available the character editor, essentially a cheat program that allows to alter the player's stats, items and the amount of available gold. Like in Black Magic, an optional sound pack adds Sound Blaster effects and music to the game.
