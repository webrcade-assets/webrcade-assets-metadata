Bugworld is a single player, freeware, keyboard controlled game that plays a bit like Pac Man with shooty bits.
The plot isn't the best advert for the KD Games, apparently the player has just bought one of their games and now finds their computer is infested with bugs so they head off to an island to kill them. Both the bugs and the player's character are represented by squares and naturally the bugs live in a multi level maze that is viewed top down in 2D. Around the maze are traps, ammunition, health and other power-ups together with coloured keys to unlock doors.
The player can shoot the bugs but they cannot aim their weapon which will always shoot in the direction they last moved - so if they are running away from a big bad bug towards a wall and fire the weapon they will shoot the wall and not the bug behind them.
The game has sound effects, music, a high score table and offers the option to save on exit.
