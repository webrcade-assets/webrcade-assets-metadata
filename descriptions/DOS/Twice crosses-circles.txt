Twice crosses-circles is an electronic adaption of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game by placing Xs and Os on a field of nine squares to make OXO rows. The game is played according to slightly modified rules. There is an advantage to having the starting move, so for this version it is necessary to draw up two adjacent rows, but not parallel. The computer needs to prevent this and make a regular series. At the same time, the computer moves randomly, which is logical, since any meaningful move is guaranteed to deprive the chances of winning.
