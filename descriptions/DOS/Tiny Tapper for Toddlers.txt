Tiny Tapper for Toddlers is designed to be a child's first computer game. Each letter/number typed in produces a different effect. It starts with displaying the letter hit; then some letters display an animation, others play a sound or music, and others have a short game. For example, "2" plays the sound of a stone dropping into water, "S" shows a flying saucer crossing the screen, "W" lets the child write a short message (or more likely random letters), and "Y" causes a stick man to jump whenever a key is pressed.The game was distributed as Shareware. The registered version allowed customizing with the child's name and added a screensaver that would appear after a couple minutes.
