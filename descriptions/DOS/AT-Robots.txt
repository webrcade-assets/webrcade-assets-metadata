AT-Robots is a programming game where users create a robot’s AI using the game’s proprietary programming language based on Turbo Pascal. This programming is done outside the game using a text editor. Each robot is equipped with a scanner (to detect other robots), a weapon, armor, an engine (for speed), a heatsink (to prevent overheating), mines, and a shield. The properties of these components are determined by allocating a limited number of points.Once the programs are complete (up to six), they are loaded into the game, and the robots compete in an arena. During the simulation, users can adjust the display settings (e.g., toggle graphics or change the speed) but cannot influence the simulation itself. The game includes four pre-made robots.
