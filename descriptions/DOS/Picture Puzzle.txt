Picture Puzzle is a single player picture puzzle game.The game takes a standard picture and breaks it into pieces, the player then reassembles these pieces to make a picture. The game is played entirely with the mouse and the player moves by selecting two pieces which the game then swaps. When a piece lands in the correct position a pleasing chime can be heard, when adjacent pieces are correctly placed the overlying grid disappears and the pieces are locked in place and can no longer be swapped with another piece.All the pieces are rectangular in shape and the number of pieces in the final puzzle is set by the player to any number between 4 and 1400. The documentation states that using a high number of pieces will result in lots of pieces for sky, grass, water etc all looking the same and that the puzzle will automatically complete these areas if they are exactly identical.This version, version 1.3, of the program only supports one resolution of picture which is 640x350x16, but they can be in the game's own .puz format, .pcx format or .gif format.
