Vira ("вира" is a professional "lift" command used by Russian loaders) is a puzzle game intended to load the goods of different characteristics onto a boat for a given time (500 seconds) to keep this boat's equilibrium. The player controls the crane, which lifts, rotates, moves, and loads the goods. There are three campaigns: Egyptian (same shapes, different weights), Norman (different shapes, same weights), and Modern (different shapes, same weights, and fills all the boat). When the level in each campaign is completed, the animated sequence transfers the player to the next level. The progress is restored with the next game run, and the player can continue any of the campaigns to the finish.
