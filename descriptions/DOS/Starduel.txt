Starduel is a two player game in which each player controls a spaceship in a time limited battle, flying around a star, shooting at each other.Each player uses the keyboard keys to turn his or her ship an any direction, and give it a velocity; a ship will continue at constant speed and direction until changed by the players, and if if flies off the edge of the screen, it will come back on the opposite side.Each time a ship is destroyed, the opponent scores a point. If both ships are destroyed in a collision, both players score a point.A damage model allows for partial destruction, so depending on where a ship gets hit, and from how far away, the damage may be survivable.There is a limited amount of fuel and ammunition, and the duel has a default 20s time limit, after which the game ends and the score is shown, resulting in declaring either left or right player as the winner, or the game as a draw.The playing field is a fixed black screen, wrapping around at the edges, and the star is an indestructible object lacking gravity, and does not affect the flight path of the ships, unless a ship flies into it, in which case the ship is destroyed.The game parameters can be edited in the start menu, to change game length, fuel amount, maximum speed etc.(Some parameters like game length, are not changeable until the game is registered).
