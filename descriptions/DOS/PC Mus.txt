Go to the Amarraco Feroz bar at Villa Mus, to play this popular Spanish cards game along with some of the celebrities of the epoque, or rather, their cartoon "caricaturizations". Among them you will find politicians, TV presenters, actresses, "controversial" entrepreneurs and many others. You can play a single game or an entire championship, in both cases first you will choose your game partner, so you can play mus against other couples. Also, sometimes the game will let you send "signals" to your partner (which is always controlled by the CPU) so he/she can know if you have a good play.
