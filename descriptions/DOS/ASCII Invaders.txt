ASCII Invaders is a single-player, freeware Space Invaders clone written in PASCAL. As the title suggests the invaders are all composed of ASCII characters. Unlike the original game there are no houses to hide behind.
The SPACEBAR fires the player's missile. However, there can only be one missile in flight at any one time, so if it misses the aliens the player must wait until their projectile clears the top of the screen before they can fire again. In addition to the standard missile the player also has a limited number of bombs which clear an entire column, super bombs which clear the bottom row and nuclear bombs which clear an entire screen. More lives and bombs are awarded if the player stays alive long enough.
