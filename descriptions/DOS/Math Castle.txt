The titular castle's advanced technology prepares for an incoming alien invasion. The player must solve equations consisting of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to eliminate flying saucers for as long as the energy shield holds, or until all of the alien fleet is eliminated. After completing the exercise there is a timed bonus round where the player must solve equations as fast as possible.
