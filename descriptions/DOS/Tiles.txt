Tiles is a text-mode adaptation of Mahjongg Solitaire. The player's goal is to clear the board of tiles by selecting pairs of identical tiles, with the limitation that each selected tile must be free from either the left or the right, and cannot have another tile on top of it.The game contains seven levels with different initial board layouts. Once less than 8 tiles remain and no more moves are possible, the player can move on to the next level, but it is also possible to start from any level.The player receives 20 points for every removed pair, and bonus points for completing the level. A hint feature is available, which points to a removable tile but also deducts 50 points from the score.
