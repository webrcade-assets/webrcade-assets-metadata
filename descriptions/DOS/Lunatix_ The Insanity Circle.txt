Lunatix: The Insanity Circle is a classic parser-based text adventure with a modernized interface and graphics. The player assumes the role of an asylum administrator. When the administrator is about to leave the asylum and go home, a strange man stops him at the exit - he has stolen the administrator's keys while he was taking a nap in the office! He will only return the keys if the administrator takes a pill the strange man gives him... and so begins the crazy psychedelic adventure of the Insanity Circle.
The game is a classic adventure featuring inventory puzzles and NPC conversations. All actions are performed by typing in what the player character should do. The game window is divided into three sections: a depiction of the current scene in the top left, a description of the current room in the top right, and the main text window at the bottom where the player types in commands and the results of actions are described.
Some actions can lead to the player's death, but the game allows undoing any action so the fatal decision can be undone and no progress is lost even if the player hasn't saved for a while.
