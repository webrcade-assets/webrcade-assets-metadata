Stormfighter is a futuristic combat flight simulator that leans somewhat towards the arcade playing style. The game does not provide much background concerning the plot, but the player takes on the role of a fighter-bomber pilot participating in some kind of armed conflict that takes place in the future, possibly on Earth or an Earth-like planet. The full game has 40 missions with various objectives that usually involve destroying critical enemy installations and/or protecting friendly targets from attacks. During a mission, the player craft can land at friendly airbases to rearm, refuel and even get repairs. Upon completing a mission, the player's score is displayed with the amount of points depending on performance. More points are awarded for skilful use of the onboard gun while relying on more powerful weapons like missiles and bombs results in lower score.Stormfighter has a built-in encyclopedia that details all in-game objects, such as enemy ground forces and installations, with the most interesting (and coincidentally, the strongest enemy unit) being the "Elefank" -- a quadrupedal armed walker mech that was obviously inspired by Imperial AT-ATs from Star Wars.
