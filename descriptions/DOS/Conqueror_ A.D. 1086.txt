Strategy/managerial game set in the medieval England, much like Defender of the Crown. The player starts out as a young knight in control of a small fiefdom and performs the usual managerial decisions to develop the economy, raise an army and expand their territory. RPG and arcade gameplay are also thrown into the mix as the player has to develop their character as a knight, going to melee and joust tournaments (actually arcade sequences) to gain experience. These also have other uses such as affecting popularity and offering a chance to expand the fiefdom by allowing to courtship noble ladies.
The game is mostly played from an isometric view, except for some specific screens, and uses SVGA graphics. The game can end in two different ways: by marching to London and taking the crown from William the Conqueror, or going the hero route and hunting down the enormous dragon that has been scorching the lands for years.
