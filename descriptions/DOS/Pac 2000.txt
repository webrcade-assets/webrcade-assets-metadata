Pac 2000 is a pretty simple in concept and in options (in the main menu, the player only can redefine the keyboard) low budget Pac-Man clone (sold only at newsstands), with a military theme, and a robotic Pac-Man starring.
The game is composed of 5 different missions with 2 levels each. Along the game, the player can take pills with various effects: improve the speed of the robotic Pac-Man, obtain more points, obtain an extra life... And of course, the player can take also the classic pills, that give him temporal invulnerability.
