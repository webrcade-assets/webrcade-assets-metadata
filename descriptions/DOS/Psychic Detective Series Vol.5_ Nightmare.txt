The psychic detective Katsuya Furuyagi is finally able to enjoy a peaceful life with his sweetheart Rieka. But a strange nightmare begins to haunt him. He sees an unknown young woman locked in a secluded castle, begging for help. One night, the nightmare takes a different shape - the woman turns into a miraculous creature as Furuyagi enters the castle. Knowing that his unique psychic skills allow him to communicate directly with people's minds, Furuyagi begins to wonder if the nightmare has anything to do with reality - which he will find out soon enough.Nightmare is the fifth entry in the Psychic Detective series. Like its predecessors, it is a Japanese-style adventure game with locations represented as still screens viewed from first-person perspective. Conversations and event-triggering advance the plot; there is no inventory management or puzzles. The player can interact with objects on screen in a point-and-click fashion, with verb commands selected from a menu.
