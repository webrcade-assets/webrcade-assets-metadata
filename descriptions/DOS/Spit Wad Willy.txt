Spit Wad Willy is an action game similar to Pang. The player controls Willy who has to shoot (only straight up) bouncing balls. Each time he hits a large one, it splits into two smaller ones; the goal of each level is to destroy all of them. Additionally there are robot enemies and bosses. Destroyed balls may leave behind power-ups such as slowing down time, an extra life or improving the attack. Each hit results in a life loss and the need to restart the level.
The game was later re-released as Pea Shootin' Pete with minor differences.
