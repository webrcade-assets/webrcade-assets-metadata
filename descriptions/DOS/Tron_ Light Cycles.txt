Based off the Disney movie TRON, this game attempts to recreate the light cycle game. Two colors face off in the attempt to box in and ultimately crash the other opponent using "Light Trails" that spring up behind each machine. A store randomly appears in which you can buy upgrades to your light trail and various devices to hinder your opponent. You can play against another player or the computer.
