Codebreaker is a single player, keyboard controlled, Mastermind variant which is now available as freeware.
The game is the work of a single developer and is written in Borland C++. As with the board game the object is to deduce a sequence of four colours by making a series of guesses. For each guess the game will show a black circle if the guess contains a correctly coloured peg in the correct position and a white circle if the correct colour is present but in the wrong position.
The game also allows the player to vary the colours used, the number of guesses allowed, and the time taken.
