The objective of Nederland (The Netherlands) is to point out as many cities on the map of the Netherlands as possible in 150 seconds. The computer displays the name of a city on the screen and the player has to move their pointer to the city's location on the map to get points. After the player has located the city, the name of another city is displayed. When the player does not know where a city is located, they can ask the computer to show, but the score will be halved.
