Dot Valley is a Boulder Dash clone.The goal of the game is to collect all diamonds that are not embedded in earth (those with the black background). If all diamonds in a level have been collected, you can enter the next one.Different opponents and traps are partially making this task more difficult. The almost omnipresent danger consists of dropping boulders, whose falling down you usually cause yourself. Therefore, the digging of mines beside or under boulders should be thought through well.Alternatively to the collecting of diamonds these can also be destroyed in another way - but there are no points given for this. For example some monsters eat diamonds and just have to be led in the right direction to do so. Diamonds are also destroyed if they fall into a glowing stream of lava.In some levels the supplies of diamonds must additionally be blocked. For this the diamond machines have to be destroyed or blocked.
