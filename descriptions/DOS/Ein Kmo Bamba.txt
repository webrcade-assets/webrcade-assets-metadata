The game is the second promotional game for the Israeli snack Bamba.
The gameplay is similar to Bouncing Babies.
In this game, Bamba snacks are being thrown by animals and the player has to prevent the snacks from falling and bounce them into the Bamba bag located on the other side of the screen, while avoiding occasionally thrown dynamites.
Upon collecting 20 snacks, the player is moved to a different area and gets an extra life.
