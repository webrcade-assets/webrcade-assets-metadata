Svenska Flygfält (Swedish Airfields) is a scenery addon for Microsoft Flight Simulator v 5.1 (DOS) and with release v3.0 also for MSFS v6.0 (AKA MS Flight Simulator for Win95).All of Swedens (at the time of publication) 176 airfields are included. All ILS, VOR (40) and NDB beacons are listed and also OMI markers are implemented for the larger airfields. Some 70+ airfields (mainly in southern Sweden) have more details, including taxiways, airport buildings and runway lights for night operations. Outside of the airfields are extra scenery for notable structures, like major bridges, and any masts over 100m height is on the map. The maps have been corrected to within 2km accuracy, from southern Sweden up to Gävle, to better follow the actual coastline.The manual contains two navigation excercise intended to show off the new scenery.Note: Some specific airport scenery features like parked / taxiing / flying AI aircraft found in earlier versions are not implemented for MSFS 6.0.
