Turbo Trek is a spaceship combat simulation game inspired by Star Trek. It features multiple races, such as the F, K, R, Orion, and Kzinti, each with different non-infringing ship designs. It also comes with a ship designer. The game is based around scenarios. It comes with some 1â€“2 player scenarios, and includes a scenario editor.Once a scenario is chosen, combat begins. Combat is divided into turns. Each turn starts by assigning power to various systems, such as warp engines, shields, or disruptors. The player usually controls multiple ships, and can assign power differently for each ship. Once power is assigned, the operations phase begins. In this phase, players can move, fire, and use other systems as they see fit, limited by the power assigned to each system. The operations phase is divided into 10 sub-turns.Turbo Trek was distributed as shareware. The registered version came with a tactical guide.
