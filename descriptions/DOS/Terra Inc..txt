It is the year 2400. Humankind has terraformed and colonized Mars. Over 1 million people live on Mars, when the contact to earth is cut off. A civil war starts, between the States of Mars, for the resources and the territories. At the height of the war, a comet is discovered en-route to Mars. A catastrophe is imminent. The citizens of Terra Inc., a huge industrial hive-city, build a railway network to move their city to the Southern hemisphere of the planet to escape the meteor. Too bad that the states on the Southern hemisphere will do everything in their power to fight You, and your city. Your mission is to fight the Southern states, and get to safety.
