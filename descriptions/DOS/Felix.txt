Felix is a Boulder Dash clone. You guide your character to the end of the level, while collecting treasures and solving puzzles. Take into account gravity (things can fall on your head), skulls that kill you if you collide with them, plants that grow and block your way, and also if you don't do the parts of the level in the right order etc. A map is available to help you find your way in levels. There are ten levels and you can use level codes to start directly in a specific one.
