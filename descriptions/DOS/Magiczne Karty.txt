The game is all about moving, replacing or discovering cards. You can choose from a set of 8, 18 and 32 cards and 3 levels of difficulty, as well as several types of boards and puzzles. The first riddle requires you to identify two of the same cards, the second - organize tabs by changing their position, and the third - the bottom should be covered with the upper card, but you can only move the upper with one vacancy. The cards can be pictures, letters and digits.
