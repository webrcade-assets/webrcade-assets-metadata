Iskib is a 2D side-scrolling, arcade-like action game. The player's objective is to run a whole level, avoiding being shot or hit by obstacles. This can be done by controlling the run speed (running faster/slower), jumping or firing a gun. Enemies are represented by spaceships that move in awkward patterns and occasionally drop bombs on the running player. Sometimes mines or rocks block the road and one has to jump over them. Every bomb hit or obstacle hit is fatal, one life is lost and the whole level is restarted. Some power-ups are found on the road: bullets to replenish bullet supply, "extra fire" to make it possible to fire more than 1 bullet simultaneously or "hover" to extend jumping abilities. The game was designed to be included in an issue of Compute! magazine.
