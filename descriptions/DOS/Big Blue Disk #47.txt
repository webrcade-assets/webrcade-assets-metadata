This issue of the monthly software subscription features two games: Castle of Kroz and Scramble. These are available from a scrolling, text-based menu along with a variety of articles, utilities and applications (including Spanish Tutor, a simplistic memorization and testing tool, and Words for Kids, a children's word processor).
