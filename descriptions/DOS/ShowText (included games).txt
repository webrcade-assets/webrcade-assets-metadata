The ShowText system is a programming language, designed for developing interactive DOS applications with a customized TUI (text-based user interface) and mouse support. The system was originally distributed as a shareware product, and each release came with a selection of demonstration programs - including games. As of the final revision (v2.2, released as freeware) the package includes the following games:

Attack (aka Aliens in earlier versions), in which you hunt down invading ships with the mouse cursor before they laser the city to death
Bricks , a Breakout clone
Card Match , a concentration game with standard playing cards
Cave-Dive , where you must collect diamonds while dodging bombs and cave walls, all in free-fall
Depth Charge , similar to Deep Scan, where a destroyer must time its charges to destroy the roving submarines below the surface
Land-Mine , a Minesweeper variant
Lights-Off , an adaptation of the electronic puzzle game Lights Out
MasterMind , revisiting the classic code-breaking board game of the same name
Number Guessing , which gives you five attempts to guess a number between 1 and 50 based on visual cues
Peg Jump (aka Pegs ), a game of peg solitaire
Puzzle , the familiar basic 4x4 sliding tile puzzle
Reverse , which challenges you to arrange the scrambled digits from 1 to 9 by reversing parts of the sequence at a time
Sequence Repeat , a 'Simon Says' game with optional sound
Shooting Gallery , the well-known carnival shooting game, now in ASCII form
Towers , a Tower of Hanoi puzzle, playable with 3-7 discs
Wiggle-Worm , a multi-level Snake -like game (including instructions for designing additional levels using the ShowText language)
