Little People Bowling Alley is a 1-2 player trivia/bowling game for multiple systems.
Each player controls a little person, who is positioned at a bowling lane. The player rolls the ball, and tries to knock as many pins as possible. There are 2 balls per frame with 6 pins, and a total of 10 frames in a game. On difficulty 1, the player always rolls straight, but on higher difficulty the player must coordinate their button presses with character movement to bowl straight ahead.
