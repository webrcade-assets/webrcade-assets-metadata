Ultizurk is a role-playing game inspired by the classic Ultima series, made by solo developer Robert J. Deutsch who went by the moniker "Dr. Dungeon". In Ultizurk, the player controls a single pre-made character (there is no character creation) who is summoned by King Eldor to save his realm from the troubles it suffers from. Monsters roam the land and the sea is swarming with sea-dragons that attack shipping lanes, and the king wants to know where these creatures come from and wants the player to put an end to their invasion.Gameplay is very similar to the early Ultima games. The player's character is displayed as a tiny stick figure like character and the viewport of the gameworld is very small, taking up only a quarter of the screen. Below the small viewport, the different commands are listed (look, talk, inventory, etc.), and when the player engages in dialog this is where the text appears. Dialogs use a keyword system where the player types in words and NPCs respond with what they know about that word. Combat is a very simple affair: walk next to an enemy and press A to attack. Enemies don't move, so unless the player chooses to engage them, they will not attack on their own.
