Klondike is a single-player, shareware version of the classic solitaire game. The game can be played in 'Strict Mode' in which the player has just one pass through the stack of undealt cards, or 'Relaxed Mode' in which the player can go through the undealt cards multiple times. There is no 'drag and drop' mechanism for moving cards in this game, the player clicks on the card(s) to be moved and then clicks on their destination. There is in-game help text, comprehensive game documentation. The game is intended to be played with the mouse but can be played with a keyboard.
