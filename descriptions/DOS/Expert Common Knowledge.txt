Expert School of Knowledge is a trivia game for up to four players. There are three levels of play; beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Beginner gives one point per answer with thirty seconds on the clock. Intermediate gives two points and twenty seconds. Advanced rewards three points per correct answer but only allows ten seconds per answer. There are ten questions per category and the categories are; literature, music & arts, history, grab bag, entertainment & sports, science & computers, nature, mathematics, geography, and vocabulary. Randomly the game will ask you a bonus question which rewards a doubled point. After all the categories are finished the game will give you a final score, a grade average and, if deserving, an honorary diploma which you can print.
