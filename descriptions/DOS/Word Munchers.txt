Word Munchers is an installment in the Munchers series focused on vowel sounds. The player moves his muncher creature on a board, the task is to eat the right words with the same vowel sound as a word shown at the top of the screen. Sometimes, unfriendly creatures called Troggles enter the playfield. They come in different types with different patterns and abilities, and running into them depletes Muncher lives, as does eating incorrect words. Occasionally, safety squares appear which offer some temporary protection. It's possible to make some adjustments to the game, such as the difficulty by using the management options.
