Like in the previous game, the system is very simple, without inventory, equipment, or multiple attacks available. The sequel has more battles and more diverse goals, which often involve more than simply eliminating all the enemies and require the player to protect children from being harmed, rescue innocent people, pursue fleeing enemies, etc.
