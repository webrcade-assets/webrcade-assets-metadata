Westfront PC: The Trials of Guilder is a text adventure in which the player completes quests in order to progress through the game. Version 6.25 of he game is spread over four continents with eight hundred and twenty-five rooms to explore, twenty quests and ninety three monsters to battle or rob. (There are later Windows versions of the game which are said to contain over seventeen hundred rooms.)The game, naturally, starts in a tavern where the player starts their adventure to raise an army and defeat the evil sorcerer Serlin.Simple commands such as Up, Down, North, South, East and West can be abbreviated to a single letter while later versions allow multiple commands such as 'KILL DEMON AND GO SOUTH'.In the original design of the game if a player died the game ended and the player had to restart and replay from a saved game. Later this was changed and death put the player in purgatory until they could find a way to escape, all items were retained but all gold was lost.
