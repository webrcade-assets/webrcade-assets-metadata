A Night with Troi is a fan game based on Star Trek: The Next Generation. The player takes the role of an unnamed male member of the ship who convinced Deanne Troi to have sexual intercourse with him. Besides the title screen, there are no graphics.
The whole game takes place in her quarters which consist of a living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. The player interacts with the game by typing in commands (the parser is limited and only understands one command per action) which mostly consists of switching rooms and giving commands to Troi, e.g. ordering her to lay down or undress. The sex acts themselves are non-interactive, but the text changes depending on certain parameters like the room and Troi's position. There are no puzzles, but the player needs to find and collect an item in order to have anal sex with Troi.
