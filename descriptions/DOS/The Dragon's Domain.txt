There once was a powerful wizard. Unfortunately, the sacred chalice, the source of his power, was stolen by three dragons, and hidden in a maze. Your goal is to find the chalice and return it to its rightful place. To do so, you'll need to travel through four mazes and six castles.The Dragon's Domain is an action game heavily influenced by Adventure. As in that game, you explore a maze of screens to find keys, and fight dragons and other monsters.The game was distributed as freeware, but with a request for donations.
