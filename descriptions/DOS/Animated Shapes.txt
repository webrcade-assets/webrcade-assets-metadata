Animated Shapes is an educational game that teaches children about shapes and colors. In this game, players are presented with a shape featuring a colored outline. They must then select the corresponding shape (from five choices) and color (from 10 choices) from a list. If both choices are correct, the next shape is displayed, and this process continues until an object is formed. Once the object is complete, it transforms into a fully colored version, accompanied by an animation.
