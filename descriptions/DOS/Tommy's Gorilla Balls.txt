Watch out for those balls as they come flying at you in Tommy's Gorilla Balls. This simple arcade game's objective is to move your player around the game board with the keyboard and avoid balls that are coming at you from the four corners. By getting balls to collide into each other you will gain points and if you get hit with balls you lose. Challenge is added to a player who can continually avoid balls by a shrinking game board. The longer you last against balls the smaller the game board gets. A high-score table records your points and time of play and is displayed when you are finally hit with balls.
