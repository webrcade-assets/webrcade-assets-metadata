In the XXII century the universe is dominated by two major forces born after decades of major wars: the Empire and the Hark Federation. Both of them being expansionist governments, frictions in their borders are almost constant.Within the Empire, the biggest power after the emperor himself, are the Mega Corporations, financial partnerships that control every aspect of people's lives. With power of life and death, these Mega-Corp, as they are familiarly known, extend their tentacles by the Cosmos in search of riches to extract or eventually snatch.The federal system consists of the "adoption" under its tutelage of technologically poor planetary systems in general, although rich in material or manpower that are invariably employed in improving the resources of the original Hark planets. "Megacorp" is a conversational adventure with static graphics in which you will take part of the Imperial federation. Your exact mission would be guiding your operative agent to get control of the situation on the GEA-3 planet. You should, helping rebel groups, overthrow the government, now in the hands of The Federation.Your craft will land on the forest surrounding the rebel base. Cross the lake, pass police checks and find your link to be identified by their status as a merchant in fur, and from there follow his instructions. The mission is risky but the reward is great, if you make GEA-3 planet be part of the Empire, you will become immensely rich.
