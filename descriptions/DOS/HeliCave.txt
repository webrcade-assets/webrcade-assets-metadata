A simple cave-flyer: maneuver your helicopter through the volcanic caves by avoiding collision with the cave walls.  The helicopter is continuously dragged downwards by gravity, and gains altitude by holding down the spacebar.  The score increases along with the distance covered; every 1000 points, a new level begins - with a narrower, more dangerous cave.The entire game is squeezed into 256 bytes of executable code, side-scrolling graphics and sound included.
