Scenarios Volume 1: Great Disasters is an expansion pack for SimCity 2000. This particular addition adds a total of 10 harrowing scenarios which range from a fictitious UFO attack in Atlanta, Georgia - in Dec. 2050 no less - to the very real great Mississippi floods of 1993 (the Davenport flood in this particular instance).
