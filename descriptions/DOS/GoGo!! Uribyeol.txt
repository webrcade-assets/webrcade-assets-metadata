GoGo!! Uribyeol is a "cute-em-up": a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with nonsensical enemies and colorful, stylistically diverse levels. The game can be played in single-player or cooperative two-player mode. The gameplay system is fairly simple: players control cute-looking airplanes with two basic attacks: a three-way shot, and a more powerful spreading wave. Flying and ground-based stationary enemies must be eliminated or avoided. Some stages consist entirely of a boss fight. Each player-controlled craft has a health bar; once it reaches zero players may opt to continue from the same spot. The game is over when players run out of continues.
