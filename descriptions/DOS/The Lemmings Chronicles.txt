In terms of chronology, this is the third installment in the Lemmings series. Similar to the predecessor, the game focuses on the tribes but on the contrary not twelve but only three of them are present: egyptian, classic and shadow. Each of them has its own audio-visual theme. The game concept changed and instead of being given a number of actions to be performed in a specific moment, the lemmings collect the abilities on their way home. Each lemming can collect only one ability at a time and can put it away at any moment so another one can use it. What is more, each lemming has the ability to block the way, change walking direction or jump, and these can be used an unlimited number of times. There are in total 90 levels - 30 for each tribe with an option to save your progress.
