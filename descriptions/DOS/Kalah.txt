Kalah is an adaptation of the Oriental board game with the same name, which is a part of the Mancala family of games. The two-player game is played by one player against an AI opponent by turns. Each player has six boxes containing six balls and a kalah, a rod to collect the balls. Each turn the player selects one of the boxes to distribute its balls one-by-one to the next boxes and kalahs counterclockwise. The aim of the player is to collect more balls for the player's kalah. The game ends up, when all the balls are transferred from boxes to kalahs.
There are important notes in game rules as follows:* If the last distributed ball is placed into player's kalah, the player is awarded with one more turn;

If the last distributed ball is placed into player's empty box, all the balls from the opposite opponent's box are added to the player's kalah;

If there are no more balls in all player's boxes, all the balls from opponent's boxes are added to the player's kalah.

The game optionally allows to undo the move as well as to get an unlimited number of advices. There are four difficulty levels of the AI opponent: Novice, Pupil, Guru, Sage.
