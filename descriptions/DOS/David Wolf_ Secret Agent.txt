Bruno Vasto, a madman, has stolen the experimental SF-2 stealth fighter and threatens to blow up Washington D.C.! It's up to you to infiltrate Vasto's organization and retrieve the fighter to save the world. It's all in a day's work for David Wolf, the secret agent.David Wolf: Secret Agent merges digitized cinematic cutscenes with bitmap and 3D animation to create an action-based interactive movie. Four 3D action simulations are the heart of the game: HangGliding (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Sportscar driving (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Fighter Simulation (with a machine gun and a missile launcher mounted to the front), and Skydiving (no machine gun). The player follows along with the story for a few minutes, then is attacked and must outwit his opponents to live.
