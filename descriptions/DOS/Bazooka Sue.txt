Save the world with Bazooka Sue, the only half-female, half-swine protagonist besides Miss Piggy.
Spoil the evil plans of mad scientist Dr. Bruth and become a local hero in Swamp Rock, a small town in the swamps of Lousiana.
If you know any of the classic LucasArts point and click adventures, you'll have a very good idea about the gameplay in Bazooka Sue.
Only released in German language.
