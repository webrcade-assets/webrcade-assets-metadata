The Signature Edition is an improved version of Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design. The game and course design interface are fairly similar so there is no learning curve if you've played the first, but now the graphics and sound are greatly improved. The Signature Edition could also play courses created for Unlimited Golf, and the terrain would be improved but objects remained in the original more limited color palette.Two golf courses designed by Jack Nicklaus are included :Sherwood Country ClubEnglish Turn Golf & Country Club
