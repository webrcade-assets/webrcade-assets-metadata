Three Worlds of AD&D is a single CD compilation of three games:

Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession
Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse
Dark Sun: Shattered Lands

Although related by an adherence to the 2nd edition AD&D rules, the three worlds are not related. Each game is derived from a unique Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. The compilation comes with a full 3-in-1 manual for the games (250+ pages).
The CD also has a demo version of Thunderscape.
