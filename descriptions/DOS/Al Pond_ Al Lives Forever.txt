Al Pond: Al Lives Forever is a freeware adventure game made using Sierra's AGI engine. As a result, the gameplay closely resembles other AGI titles: the protagonist, Al Pond, is moved directly across the screen, and the player interacts by typing commands through a parser.
The game follows Al Pond’s journey, which initially takes him to New Yerk City (sic!) and later to Nonytoonyfatso Island. There, he faces the challenge of preventing Dr. Kony’s evil plans. Throughout the game, Al must collect various items to progress and solve puzzles. For instance, finding a passport becomes essential for him to board a plane to NYC.
