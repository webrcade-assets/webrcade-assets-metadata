A Concentration game played on a 8x5 board, consisting of 20 pairs of matching tiles in a jumbled arrangement. As a new game is started, all tile faces are shown for a short time, then hidden; the player must select two locations per move to uncover matching pairs. When a match is made, the two tiles are eliminated: the goal is to clear the board in the lowest number of moves. The player may select either numbers or symbols to mark the tiles.
