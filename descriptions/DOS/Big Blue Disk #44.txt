This issue of the monthly software subscription contains only one full-version game: Chagunitzu, the precursor to Apogee's Paganitzu action/puzzle game. The issue does include some other entertainment-oriented material, however: Dino-Sorcerer (a program which generates random dinosaur pictures), a demo version of Micro Bridge Companion (software for fans of the card game) and a review of Harpoon. These items, along with additional applications and articles, are accessed through a text-based menu system.
