Hall of Fame CD-ROM is a collection of shareware and public domain software. Though the menu runs in DOS and the majority of the contents are designed for this platform there is a Windows section which contains a mixture of utilities, 'jokes' and games.The menu system is quite simplistic and not user friendly. The fist screen requires the user to select a category by number, DOS games are numbered 23-26 and Windows is number 70. Once the category has been selected the user has options to transfer or unpack a file from the CD to another disc, all games are in .lzh format, but in order to do this they must first browse the file list, then select and remember the exact name. The unpack option is used to install games, the transfer option is used to transfer any documentation that is held separatelyThe groupings themselves are best described as a rough guide to the wide variety of software and games on the disc. For example under 'Educational and other titles for kids' there is an animated alphabet, algebra and maths tutors as well as teacher's scoring aids while the 'Games' section contains programs for racing handicapping and collating baseball statistics.
