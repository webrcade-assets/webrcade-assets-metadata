Tommy's Gorilla Ball Train is a single-player DOS game of the Snake genre. The player starts with a small train that is constantly moving. Using the arrow keys the player must keep the train moving to score points. The challenge is to keep the ever growing, ever moving train in motion it yet avoiding any contact with the walls or itself. The train is steered entirely with the numeric keypad while function keys are used to access the help screens and change the game's difficulty settings etc. The moving train drops debris as it travels around the screen. Any contact with that debris will derail the train and end the game.The game area features four bridges which can be approached from any direction. While travelling under these bridges self collisions are ignored. The game has nine levels of difficulty and records the top ten scores at each level. The player has one life only and the objective of the game is to achieve a high score.
