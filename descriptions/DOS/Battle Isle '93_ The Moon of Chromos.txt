The Moon of Chromos is the second scenario (or "Data Disk") for Battle Isle, but is standalone and does not require the original game. It keeps the same split-screen turn-based strategy formula where the goal is to capture the opponent's headquarters or destroy all their units in order to win on several hex-grid based maps, but, as the title implies, takes the conflict to Chromos' moon and brings some new units to the table.
