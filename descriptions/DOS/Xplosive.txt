Xplosive is a Bomberman -like game for one to four players. It offers no major deviations from the original formula: each of the players controls a character (here they're represented by rabbits) who is able to plant timed bombs that can destroy walls, roaming monsters and the players themselves if they're not careful to avoid the path of the blast. Destroying certain wall blocks will reveal powerups that can be picked up to increase movement speed, blast radius, the number of bombs that can be planted at a time etc.
Xplosive features two game modes called Duel Game and Level Game. The former means free-for-all battles between human players on randomly generated levels (with or without AI-controlled monsters), and the latter is a single-player or cooperative mode across a set of pre-defined levels where the main objective is to clear each stage of monsters.
Xplosive was originally marketed as shareware, with the unregistered version including only fifteen levels for single or two-player cooperative play, and two-player duel mode with pre-defined settings that could not be changed. The registered game allows up to four players in duel mode with customised settings (like turning monsters on and off), and includes several level sets of increasing difficulty, as well as a level editor for players to create their own levels and even sets. In the early 2000s, the developers made the full registered version available as a free download.
