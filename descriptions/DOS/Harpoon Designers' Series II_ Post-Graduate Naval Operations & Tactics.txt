The second of the Harpoon Designer's Series is a collection of scenarios for Harpoon - there are four sets (HDS5, HDS6, HDS7, HDS8) for each previous BattleSet with 12 missions each (up to 48 in total). Additional documentation includes the Data Annex and the Tactical Guide.
Ownership of the original Harpoon is required, the more BattleSet expansions you own the more mission sets you unlock.
