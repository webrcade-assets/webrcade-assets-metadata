Arka is the result of a programming exercise in implementing the popular paddle-vs.-wall hit Arkanoid : move a paddle left and right across the bottom of the screen, keep the ball bouncing by deflecting it, and take out all the bricks to clear the level. Lose all three balls, and it's game over. The first three levels of Arkanoid are included, but without such things as enemies or power-ups - effectively stripping the game back down to its Breakout origins.
