Boulder Star is a game inspired by Boulder Dash with 256 color VGA graphics. You are guiding a hosentroger (German pant-suspender) wearing figure, with the aim of getting diamonds and treasures out from a series of underground chambers. To achieve this, you are obliged to dig in the soil like a mole. Each chamber has an exit that opens when you collect a required amount of diamonds, you have to leave the chamber before the available time runs out. Boulders, teleporters, locked passageways, and hazardous creatures are to be dealt with. Sometimes there are TNT explosives and jackhammers are available to be used to your advantage. The shareware version contains 20 levels.
