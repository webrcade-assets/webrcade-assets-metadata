A children's game wherein kids could make their own drawings by putting several parts of a face together. You could choose from a high amount of noses, mouths, ears and eyes, as well some haircuts.In version 2 there are double as many tiles to make faces of, as well an option to color (though this is made pretty badly, you could color the game-interface away) and support for some more printers (now we know why we love windows again).You could also export your pictures to a .pcx file.
