True to its title, Aeromathics splices the standard math game fare of solving arithmetical riddles with an aerial theme. The player is presented with a series of aviation-related images, which have to be erased (using a cursor) to reveal the mathematical problems hidden behind them. Once the correct answer is entered, a new image appears, and so on until the timer runs out - the quicker you uncover the questions and type in the solutions, the higher your final score. Bonuses can be racked up for unbroken sequences of right answers, and for revealing the secret star icons that lie hidden behind random spots in the picture.
On top of the four skill levels available, it is possible to tweak the selection of problem types and their difficulty: addition/subtraction and multiplication/division, both for whole numbers and for fractions, as well as sequence completion and calculations with powers; each class of problems is itself available in four difficulty levels.
