Dylan Dog: La Regina delle Tenebre is an entry in the line of short action platformers starring Dylan Dog, "the nightmare detective". This time Dylan is going to find a mysterious woman who is calling to him in his dreams. Unfortunately his car gets stuck in the middle of nowhere, and now it's up to him and his trusty gun to find a way to the castle the lady is beckoning him to.
La Regina delle Tenebre's gameplay is similar to the earlier Dylan Dog: Murderers though the inventory management and item related puzzles of the earlier game are dropped out, replaced with occasional dialog choices when speaking to different denizens of this place.
