Paranoid is a game in the style of Arkanoid, where the player must hit a ball against a wall of bricks, to destroy them. The game is shareware and, upon registration, there was an enhanced version of the game including more levels and a level designer.
Paranoid boasts a very small program size (under 61k including all data files), thirty levels, tuneful PC speaker sound effects and sixteen-colour graphics. There are a number of upgrades and downgrades within the game, released from certain blocks including multi-ball, sticky paddle, larger paddle, smaller paddle, defensive line below the paddle, extra balls, a cannon and many more. The physics model allows players to increase or decrease the speed of the ball by controlling the angle the paddle hits it. An extra degree of difficulty comes from the shift keys being the only means of controlling the paddle - no speedy mouse control here.
