Machine Nation is a vertical-scrolling shoot-'em-up with visuals somewhat similar to Stargoose Warrior, but more focussed on avoiding obstacles rather than on shooting. The objective is to get back to the mothership while flying over a hostile machine city (hence the game title).
One of the features of Machine Nation is that the player's ship can fly at high or low altitude. The latter uses up more fuel but allows to completely avoid enemy attacks. However the player cannot fire back in this mode either. Changing altitude is only possible by flying over specific, marked tiles on the game field.
