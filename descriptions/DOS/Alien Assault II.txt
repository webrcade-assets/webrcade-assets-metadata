Alien Assault II is a top-down shooter that looks and plays very similar to Alien Breed. You control a soldier armed with a machine gun (with other weapons available for purchase later on), navigating a maze of corridors infested with deadly aliens that resemble creatures from the Alien franchise. The mission is to save the human base from the alien invasion.The game has four levels. To complete each, the player must reach a teleporter. In addition to shooting aliens, it is vital to collect pickups, including the scarce ammo clips, medikits and keycards which are the only way to progress as all doors in the complex are initially locked. As in the Alien Breed franchise games, terminals can be found in the levels that allow to buy weapons, ammo and other useful items, as long as credits are available. It is also possible to view the level map and player score in the terminals, as well turn off the lights in the level and "reverse oneways", which are special floor tiles that only allow the player to travel in one direction indicated by a red arrow.
