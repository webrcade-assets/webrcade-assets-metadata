This game offers the possibility of having any of the teams of the Spanish Primera División (92/93 season) under your control, all that mixed in a top-down scrolled football simulator, which disposes of all the players, teams, stadiums, etc. with its real names and even voice effects for each one of the stopped-ball football situations.
You can play the typical friendly match, see a demonstration match or compete in the league (with option to save the game), but at the same time, you dispose of a huge database with information about all the teams and its players. That, along with a professional program of "quinielas" (football pools), which will allow you to win some money.
Years later (coinciding with the apparition of PC Fútbol 3.0), this game was informally considered by Dinamic as the first of the PC Fútbol series, it is, PC Fútbol 1.0.
