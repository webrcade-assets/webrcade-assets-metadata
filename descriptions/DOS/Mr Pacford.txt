Mr Pacford is a single player, keyboard controlled, Pac-Man style platform puzzle game.
The player guides a Pac-Man style character around a screen where the object is to eat a fixed number of pills that are scattered around the level. This involves jumping around from platforms to crates, using lifts and explosives and other devices.
All levels are timed. After certain levels the player is given a code so that they can restart without replaying the entire game.
