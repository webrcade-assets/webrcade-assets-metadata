Wurm is a Dutch adaption of the famous Snake games.
The player controls a little worm named Wally that is constantly and swiftly moving through a room that spawns all kinds of tasty fruits. By guiding the worm left and right the player has to collect the fruits, just to accumulate points and see the creature grow bigger with every catch. While doing so Wally has to avoid trying to eat the walls of the room or its own tail, because eating something wrong will result in the loss of one of his five lives. From time to time there will be moving butterflies spawning that will restore a live once eaten, the player can even acquire more than the five starting lives. Goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible to earn a place in the integrated high score list.
So much for the basics, Wurm 's gameplay doesn't stay as simple as it first appears. Once the worm's tail has reached a certain length it will suddenly fall off the animal, creating a new non-eatable obstacle in the process. Later on, evil red worms will appear that are either just randomly moving around the screen or are trying to eat the tasty fruits before the player's worm, also growing and losing their tails when successful too often. Next will be flushes of water flooding through the room casting away the creature's valuable food. Then spiders will rope down using their spider silk and creating even more obstacles, flowers growing out of the ground need to be avoided, and so forth.
