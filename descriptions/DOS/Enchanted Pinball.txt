In the year 1522 a peace-loving magician discovered, while reading a crystal ball, that the Earth would be destroyed in the 21th century by a wicked man. He invokes the galactic forces and is transported into the 21th century landing inside a pinball machine. The player must help him out so that he can save the Earth. To do that the player must pass the nine tests such as breaking all the rocks, scaring away the evil spirits, activating the energy of the spirit serpent, feeding up a hungry frog, and others - all inside a modified pinball machine.
