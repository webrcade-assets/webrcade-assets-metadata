Animated Bugs is a digital board game designed for children. In this title, players control a red or blue bug. Two players can take turns, or one (or both) can be replaced by the computer. The gameplay revolves around spinning a wheel, which determines the number of fields the player’s bug can move (from 1 to 8). The player move their bug one step at the time by pressing either the forward or backward button. The game features two special types of fields: those marked with an “A” trigger animations, and those with a question mark force the player to spin the wheel again. However, the game randomly decides whether the player must move forward or backward.Before starting the game, players can choose from 20 background images, six difficulty levels (which only influence the number of question mark fields), and three wheel designs.
