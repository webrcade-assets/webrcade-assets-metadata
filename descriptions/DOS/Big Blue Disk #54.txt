The majority of this issue of the monthly software subscription is filled up with games. The issue's scrolling menu provides access to three entertainment titles: Dark Designs II: Closing The Gate, Word Ladders and Handy Caps. The remainder of the space is taken up by clip art, articles and a file-searching DOS utility.
