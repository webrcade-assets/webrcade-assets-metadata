This will not be easy, because that area is crawling with monsters and traps for the unwary.Dungeons of Drakklor is an action/puzzle game with 11 levels. Armed just with a fireball, you must traverse maze-like levels, using the environment and monsters to your advantage. There are upgrades to find, like half damage or double fireballs, but there are also enemies, like the cannons or the living walls.
