Galactic Conquest is a shareware game based on the principles of Risk. Shareware release v2.1 was classed as the 'Novice' version with Intermediate and Advanced versions planned but not, at that time, implemented. The Novice version is for two to seven players, there is no computer opposition in this game, and is entirely keyboard controlled.To ensure that the game is played fairly each player takes a turn at the keyboard sending their space ships out to attack other planets however what is entered is not shown on screen. When all players have entered their moves the game resolves all conflicts showing who has conquered a planet and who lost the battle.At the start of the game the players decide on how many turns the game will consist of, during the game however there is an option to end the game at the end of the current turn, the computer will resolve any remaining conflicts and announce the winner.
