Plexu: The Time Travellers is a DOS conversion of the Amiga title of the same name. The gameplay remains unchanged with only one significant change. Instead of a side-scrolling perspective the player sees the action divided into numerous single board locations with a level boss at the end. Plexu may walk, jump, use a single, double and supershot gun plus - killing all enemies on board - Smartbomb and temporary invulnerability. Between each level the player may purchase various extras in the Intergalactic Shop, including extra life or time, needed to complete subsequent stages. Fighting with the final stage boss requires targeting an opponent's head and avoiding numerous incoming missiles.
