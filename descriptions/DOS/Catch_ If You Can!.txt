Catch: If You Can! is a single-player game based on baseball.
The player controls a catcher who runs along the bottom of the screen trying to catch balls as they fall from the top of the screen. The more balls caught the higher the score. The difficulty increases every five waves and the game's documentation promises that "The excitement comes past Wave 30, when it's impossible in most cases to get perfect (or advance to the next wave!)."
The game is either joystick or keyboard controlled and has Sound Blaster support.
