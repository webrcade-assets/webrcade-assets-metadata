Keno Royale is a single-player, shareware game based on the gambling game that is popular in the USA. This game has two modes of play, casino mode and a version of a US state lottery. Whichever mode is selected the gameplay is identical the same it's just the number of selections that the player can make that changes.
The player starts with one thousand dollars and after selecting the mode of play they choose how many consecutive games to play, how much they wish to wager, and how many numbers they wish to play the limit is five numbers in state lottery mode and fifteen numbers in casino mode. Having made these choices the player can either select their own numbers or have the computer pick them. The computer then picks twenty random numbers and pays out, or most likely, does not.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled and has basic sound, bleeps when the numbers are drawn and a ta-da! when the player wins.
