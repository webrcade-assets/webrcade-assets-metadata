Tark Simmons, Priestess of the First Church, in her battle against the Demon of Dark Desire is a fantasy text adventure inspired by the world of Dungeons & Dragons. You play the role of a cleric called Tark, and while fast asleep one night, you are confronted by a vision of a dead woman called Priestess Tiana. She speaks to you and tells you that you have been summoned to the astral plane because you have been chosen as the one who must battle against a powerful demon that has been capturing the souls of artists and poets, and then fusing them together, creating a single entity called the Soul Song. You must act fast and free the Soul Song before the end of the night. You will need to understand and use magical spellcasting, by speaking magical words and also by using objects of power, called manacords. You can find out how to use each manacord by reading it. Using magic costs you spell points, of which you only have a limited supply. You are joined on your quest by a paladin companion named JenLee.
