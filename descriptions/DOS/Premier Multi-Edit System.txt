This editing system for Premier Manager 3 allows you to edit almost every aspect of the default database. You can change the names and abilities of each player, and transfer them to other teams. You can choose which divisions each club starts in, and can manage any of these, rather than having to start from the Conference league. You can even insert European teams to create a Superleague-type setup. The length of time particular injuries keep a player out for can be changed, as can the points system of the league. Once you've saved the changes and started the edited game, you can load it back into the Multi-Edit System and make further changes.
