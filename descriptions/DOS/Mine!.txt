Mine! is a Minesweeper -style game. Starting with a 29x14 grid of spaces, each uncovered space will show the number of adjacent mines. Your job is to uncover all the spaces without mines. Once complete, the game is won. Difficulty is set by the number of mines, 10â€“100.Unusually for the genre, you control a vehicle. Instead of being able to uncover any space desired, you move the vehicle to the spaces you want to uncover. (The vehicle can move in eight directions.)Also unusual is that hitting a mine does not end the game. Instead, it gives a score penalty. If you hit five mines the game will end. Scoring is points-based; you receive points for clearing each space based on the number of mines in the field. If there are only 10 mines, you get 10 points per space. If there are 100 mines, you get 100 points a space.Mine! was distributed as Shareware, but without any missing features.
