Mind Castle I is an educational title that teaches logic and reasoning. You begin by entering the basement of a mysterious, seemingly abandoned castle. There you are greeted by Mr. Winn, who says that a treasure awaits you at the top of a tower, but you must first solve puzzles and riddles to move up the floors of the castle. The puzzles themselves are generally of the type that require recognizing patterns. They can also be logic puzzles where you deduce who is lying based on statements made. They may also be a simple play on words. Mr. Winn can offer hints, but it is up to you to solve the puzzles of each floor to make it to the top of the tower.
