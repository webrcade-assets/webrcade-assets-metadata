3d-Mania is a 3D Tetris game. Pieces fall down, and need to be arranged to fill up entire planes of the 3D grid to cause them to disappear. There are four different difficulty levels, based on the complexity of the pieces. The depth of the playing field and the starting speed can also be adjusted. This game optionally supports 3D glasses (anaglyph red/blue).
There are also specials, like the Crash piece (falls through all pieces to the bottom of the field), Speedy (falls twice as fast, gives twice the score), and so on. The Maniac's shop also exists, which lets you purchase upgrades such as Slow Motion, Remove Top Layer, or Previous Level. The currency here is points. Options here require a certain Grade. Grade comes from playing, and persists over multiple games.
