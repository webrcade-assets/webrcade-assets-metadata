As a giant space slug your job is to guard your territory. Random hot-shot space-ship pilots insist on landing on your territory but don't know they're trespassing. As you devour their ships your body will get larger and larger but be careful not to go and eat yourself! Your territory is surrounded by high levels or radiation too so watch out for the borders.
A simple Snake clone, Giant Space Slug, uses ASCII graphics and has numbered levels of hardness which the player will select. The higher the level the faster you and the space-ships move.
