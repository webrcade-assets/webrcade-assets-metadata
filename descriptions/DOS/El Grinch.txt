The objective of El Grinch is to capture the titular Grinch, an elusive bug-like creature, whose hobbies seem to include (1) hiding in bean-bushes and (2) eating all day. You'll have to locate the little pest within the 10-by-10 bean field, by guessing which plant he's hiding in.When you examine your chosen location, the Grinch will make a sound: the closer he is, the shorter his chirp -- only by listening carefully you can home in on his location. If you still can't catch the sneaky vermin after 7 attempts, you can either go for a hint (to narrow down the possibilities) or give up.
