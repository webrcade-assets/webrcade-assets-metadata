Transport Tycoon Deluxe is an enhanced re-release of Transport Tycoon which introduces single-direction signals, three new landscape environments (arctic, tropical, toy land) with unique challenges, and an in-game time span from 1950 to 2050. A scenario editor is included, but the Martian environment from the Transport Tycoon World Editor is absent.
