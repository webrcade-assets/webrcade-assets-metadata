A-Pac is a Pac-Man variant. A-Pac moves around mazes and has to eat all the yellow dots while avoiding the ghosts which also roam around. Eating one of the big dots turns the ghosts blue for a limited time. While they are in this state, A-Pac can eat them for extra points and has less opposition until they respawn. Additional bonus points are rewarded for eating fruits which sometimes appear and move around on the field.There are overall eight different mazes which are divided into two maze sets which can be switched from the options menu. After playing through one set (14 stages), another 14 stages from the other set follow. There is also a fast option available which speeds up the movement speed of A-Pac and the ghosts.
