As a flotilla of ships was crossing the sea, a horrifying monster surfaced and destroyed it. A young man was washed ashore and found by local villagers. He does not remember anything, but the villagers tell him that a mysterious crystal was found near him. All the young man can recall afterwards is that his name is Atnas. He volunteers to venture into the dangerous forest and rescue the child of the family that saved him, and gradually begins to understand his role in the grand battle between humans and demons.
Shiluo de Fengyin is a Taiwanese-made role-playing game in Japanese style, set in a fantasy land reminiscent of medieval Europe. The player navigates a party of characters on the overworld, visiting towns, talking to NPCs, and exploring dungeons. Enemies appear randomly, and the first-person-view battles are strictly turn-based. Characters can attack physically or use a variety of magic spells. Like in most games of its type, characters level up automatically, and the game's structure is fairly linear.
