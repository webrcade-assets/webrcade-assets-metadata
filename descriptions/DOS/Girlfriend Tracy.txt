Girlfriend Tracy is an entry in the Girlfriend titles, a series of simulation games. Like the other girlfriends, you can start a conversation with her and ask her to perform certain actions. The girl replies using both voice and text and responds to the input of the player. She also remembers earlier conversations. The girl is shown through live action full motion video. HUD elements include the current location, time, mood, a system window, a window where text is entered and replies appear, and a status panel for syntax, semantics, response and voice.
One of the features that this girlfriend is that you can talk dirty to her, and ask her to satisfy your "desire". Therefore, this game contains nudity and erotic images and activities. This is not a default part of the game for all titles in the series, as there are also PG-13 releases for a younger audience.
