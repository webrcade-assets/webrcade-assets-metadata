Adventure II is a modified version of Adventure. This version is written in FORTRAN66 and allows players to earn 440 points. There are several new areas to explore. The new areas include parts where the player can die and an area where the player becomes thirsty and must find something to drink before the player succumbs. The game was ported to run on modern hardware when parts of the source code were rediscovered in 2001.
