Iko San is a shareware Tetris clone. The story behind the game involves a meteor striking the earth. On 13th November 2005 this object was spotted in deep space on a collision course towards Earth. While the world's armies prepare a massive nuclear strike on the object the scientific community favours using the solar reflectors on Lunar base. Your mission is to activate these reflectors and to do this you must correctly position the control rods, which effectively means playing a side-scrolling Tetris game.
This is a one or two player game that is designed to be played via the keyboard but which can also be played via a joystick. The game can be played in Story, Record Columns and Record Speed modes.
In Story Mode the game shows a countdown timer, an alarm sounds when there is only one minute remaining and when there are only thirty seconds remaining the game moves the columns around to make completion harder. In all modes the player must assemble a predetermined number of columns in order to complete the level.
Iko San plays in either the French, German or English languages, has five levels of difficulty, and supports 'AZERTY", "QWERTZU" and "QWERTY" keyboards.
