In Pursuit of Greed is a shareware raycasting 3D (2.5D) first-person shooter. Over the course of the game, the player gains access to five different playable characters, though the differences between them are mostly cosmetic. The protagonists can use melee weapons (such as daggers), but mostly rely on firearms. It is also possible to pick up and throw grenades. Ammunition and power-ups are randomly generated.
