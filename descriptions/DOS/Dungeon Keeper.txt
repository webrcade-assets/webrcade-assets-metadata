Dungeon Keeper is a strategy/building simulation in which the player constructs a dungeon and commands its hellish minions, and must take them to glory against the hated good guys. Various dungeon rooms have to be constructed to ensure efficiency and attract different creature types, and the dungeon heart must be protected at all costs. By digging through the ground, gold can be collected to pay the creatures' wages, and if they are satisfied with the conditions in the dungeon, they will remain loyal to the player and remain in the dungeon. They can alternatively be punished and tortured for a short-term gain in efficiency, but also an increased a risk of their disobedience or death. Additionally, attracting warlocks and tasking them with research will allow the player to cast powerful spells.The campaign involves the gradual takeover of the lands of good, corrupting them region by region. Also available is a multiplayer mode with up to 4 players competing.As well as being able to rotate the 3D view, and control the light source, the player can enter the direct viewpoints of friendly creatures, to see life through their eyes (one character's mode goes into black and white for this) and use their abilities directly.
