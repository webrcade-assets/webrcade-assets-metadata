RAD is a French, single player, block moving puzzle game.It seems that radioactive casks have been lost in the underground rooms of a survival shelter and a criminal organisation P.L.A.G.U..E is somehow involved. The player has been called in to resolve the situation but radioactivity levels are too high to permit entry to these rooms so everything must be done by remote control using RAD.RAD is a robot which is under the player's control, and it is used to solve a series of puzzles in which the objective is to move one or more radioactive canisters into a safe containment area- usually a hole at the bottom of the screen. There are over forty puzzles to solve. Each puzzle is timed, has limited resources and is a discrete level with its own unique code word so that the player can restart at a designated level. The codes for the first seven levels are included in the game's documentation.RAD is controlled either by the keyboard or the mouse. Along the bottom of the screen are buttons that will make RAD move left/right, ascend/descend, push an object, bridge a gap or plant a bomb. Each button can be 'pressed' with a mouse click or by pressing the associated key on the keyboard.
