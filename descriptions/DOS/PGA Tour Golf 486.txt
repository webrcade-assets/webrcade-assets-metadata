This is 1994's incarnation of the long-running PGA Tour series, this time the additions come mostly on the technical arena: new, better, graphics and sounds including videos and commentaries of all the courses, as well as 9 digitized PGA pros to play as or 55 opponents with whom to play against in the tournament. The courses in the game include the TPC at Summerlin, River Highlands, and Sawgrass with all their corresponding holes.
Gameplay is practically unchanged from the previous series, with some small additions like sudden-death playoffs to decide ties for the lead, etc. in addition to being a much more difficult game.
