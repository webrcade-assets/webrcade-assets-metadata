This game is designed for 2 to 6 year-olds, teaching the concept of the alphabet with objects at the beach. The letters can be revised in lowercase, uppercase or both. There are three different activities. The first one has the player pressing a letter on the keyboard to match the letter vocally outputted from the computer. The second one has the player pressing a letter that matches the first letter of an object. In the third one, the player is presented with multiple objects and letters and must link each object to the corresponding letter. A registered version of the game came with the user's name.
