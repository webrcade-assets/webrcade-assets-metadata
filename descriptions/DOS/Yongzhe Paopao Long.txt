The first in LonaiSoft's series of Brave Bubble Dragon games, this is pretty much a direct clone of Bubble Bobble : two plucky but affable dragons battle their way through a series of platform-laden screens, disposing of their enemies by blowing bubbles that can trap them, and collecting prodigious amounts of food along the way.
The bubbles may be jumped on, to carry your dragon into otherwise-inaccessible areas, or popped by touching them: if the burst bubble contains a trapped enemy, it'll turn into an edible bonus. In familiar fashion, certain types of bubbles may be used as weapons; power-up items can bestow special abilities; bubbles that spell out 'EXTEND' can be collected for a bonus (one million points, in this case); and even Baron Von Blubba gets his own counterpart.
Unlike Bubble Bobble, however, consecutive stages are grouped into worlds - each with its own theme, complete with a boss creature which must be disposed of using special powers. Other innovations include quirks like teleporting doors and different types of (timed) bonus stages.
