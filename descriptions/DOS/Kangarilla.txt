Kangarilla is a side-scrolling 1-player arcade game for the Apple II.The player controls a mother kangaroo who must bounce up through several levels to reach her joey in the top left corner of the screen. As the player bounces across platforms, they must bounce over small rolling balls that approach from the left. When the player positions themselves under a gap in the platform, they must make a large jump to reach the next level. If they jump at the wrong point, they smash their head on the ceiling and lose a life. When the player reaches the joey, they move to a more difficult level with faster moving balls. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost, it's game over.
