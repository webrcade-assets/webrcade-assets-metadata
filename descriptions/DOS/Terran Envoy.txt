A unique multi-genre game combining elements of puzzle and strategy.The year is 2017 - the Earth has been contacted by an advanced alien race called Ubbermenscha, who proposed to get humans into the governing body of Galactic Sector Council. But when an envoy from Earth (the player character) has been elected by the UN and enters the alien ship - it turns out we are actually being abducted: the Ubbermenscha demands that we identify the very bad guy among the other Council members called the Usurper in order for humanity to be admitted to the council.The player has to travel and investigate eight star systems with several planets orbiting around each star, finding different aliens and talking to them, mining different types of crystal that have to be exchanged for the valuable information - and discovering the true nature of each Council member - their friends and enemies, their preference in crystals, as well as their level of honesty, friendliness and loyalty to the Ubbermenscha - before identifying the Usurper and destroying his planet as instructed.Each play lasts for about an hour - and each one proposes a different puzzle to be solved, with the information and the Usurper being different in each game.
