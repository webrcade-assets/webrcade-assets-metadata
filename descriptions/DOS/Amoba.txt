Amoba is a variation on Gomoku (also known as Five in a Row), played on an extended go board of 28x18 squares. Only one human player (blue) participates, with the computer (red) for an opponent; both sides take turns placing a piece on one of the empty squares, filling it with the respective color. The goal of each side is to attain a sequence of five occupied squares in a row before the opponent does - whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The game is controlled using the mouse, and other than the dimensions of the gameboard, the only real departure from the traditional board game is the colorful animated backdrop.
