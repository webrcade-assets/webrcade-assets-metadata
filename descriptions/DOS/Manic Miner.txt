This is a remake of the original Manic Miner where you play the role of Miner Willy, a bold explorer and adventurer. He discovers a network of underground caverns used by an advanced but now extinct civilisation that left valuable metals and minerals behind. Through 20 caverns, you must collect all the keys in the level before the time (air) runs out, avoiding the nasties and navigating the pitfalls. Once all keys have been collected Willy can move to the next level by going to the flashing exit.
