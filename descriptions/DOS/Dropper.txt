Dropper is an arcade game to catch the drops of a certain liquid falling from a ceiling, until these drops make a flood in the room. The player moves a bowl on the floor, and tries to figure out where the drop will fall, reflecting its starting position on the ceiling to the location on the floor. The more accurate catch gives more points. Rare red drops give more points in comparison to ordinary blue drops. Starting from a novice difficulty, the player should complete the level filling their bowl completely to reach the next difficulty. Progress is saved in the player's profile and restored on the next game's run. Highest scores are stored in top eight table.
