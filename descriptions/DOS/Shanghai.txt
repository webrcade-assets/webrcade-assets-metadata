Shanghai is a single player, shareware, version of Mah Jong, the ancient Chinese tile matching game. The game is written in PASCAL and was originally released as shareware on bulletin boards and was later included on the April 1996 CD cover mount of PC Format (UK). It has six different tile sets and a Mark feature that allows players to bookmark the game at that point so that they can return to it should their strategy be unsuccessful. The game also has a Hall of Fame to record high scores. It is played with the mouse.
