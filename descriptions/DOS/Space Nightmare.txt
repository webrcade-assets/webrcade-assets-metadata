Space Nightmare is a shareware scrolling shoot-'em-up in 16-colour graphics. The plot involves an alien invasion (this time, the extraterrestrials are after the world's copper deposits of all things), which the player, as a pilot in the Canadian forces, is tasked to repel in missions that take place both in the atmosphere and in the Earth's orbit. Unusually, the game offers two alternating game modes: vertical scrolling levels with one of three available ships in the "Earth" scenarios, and horizontal scrolling levels with a different, fourth ship when in space.
In the vertical-scrolling mode, the player selects one of three different ships. Each has a primary weapon with unlimited ammo and a supply of missiles. Typical of the genre, various powerups are scattered around the levels or fall out from destroyed enemies, granting extra ammo, weapon upgrades and other boosts to the player. In the side-scrolling space mode, there is only one player ship type, but it is accompanied by a satellite.
Space Nightmare was marketed as shareware. The registered version has ten levels.
