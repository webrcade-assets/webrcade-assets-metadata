The "HBO exclusive" movie, Soldier Boyz, was converted into this interactive, full motion video shooter for the PC which tests your hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes and memory of the events that transpire on-screen.A United Nations airplane flying over the jungles Vietnam is shot down. Vietnamese terrorist, Vinh Moc, kidnaps Gabrielle Prescott, the daughter of an American billionaire, who was aboard that plane. Prescott seeks out and hires Major Howard Toliver, an ex-Marine and highly decorated veteran of Vietnam, to gather a team and rescue his daughter. Toliver, who now works as a counsellor in a Los Angeles prison, recruits six men to form his team - all prison inmates who are serving life sentences. The game begins as the well-armed group lands in Vietnamese territory and makes their way through the jungles to find the captive Gabrielle.The story moves along by way of interactive video cut scenes in which you must decide whether to talk or shoot. The majority of them require a "shoot first and ask questions later" mentality. If you miss your target on the first try, you are able to replay the scene repeatedly until you are successful. If you guess wrong and shoot a "friendly", you are penalized by missing out on important information.
