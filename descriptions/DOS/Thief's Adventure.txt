Thief's Adventure is a parser-based text adventure where the player assumes the role of a thief attempting a grand heist. First, the player has to convince the local fence that he is the right one for the job so the fence supplies him with tools, then the player has to break into the palace and steal war plans. The game's parser is sub-par and it is often not entirely clear which nouns can be interacted with, even though the game marks some names with a special underline effect.
