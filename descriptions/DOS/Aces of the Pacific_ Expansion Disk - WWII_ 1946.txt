This expansion set to Aces of the Pacific is premised on what might have happened in the pacific theater if WWII had not ended in 1945. Based on research of the allied war plans and documents, the player is given the chance to fly in the campaigns that might have been.
Some of the aircraft that were being prototyped when the war ended are included. These are the Grumman F7F Tigercat, the Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star (a jet), the improved Goodyear F2G-2 Corsair, and for the Japanese Navy the Kyushu J7W Shinden, the Nakajima Kikka (a jet), and the Mitsubishi Ki-83.
