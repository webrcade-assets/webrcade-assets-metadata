After the popularity PC Mus obtained, CÃ­rculo ASM decided to publish a new title with similar characteristics, but this time dealing with the more international game of domino. Again, you will go to some village of the "deep" Spain to compete against some celebrities of the country at the time (most of them politicians, but also writers, soccer club presidents and bullfighters). In this title you can do single games where you will have to choose your partner and your two rivals, but there isn't a championship mode this time. Also, there's a new section named "Consultorio" (Consulting room), where all the stats during your games (both yours and rivals') have been archived, and according to that one famous fortune teller will tell you which the are probabilities of all characters to win.
