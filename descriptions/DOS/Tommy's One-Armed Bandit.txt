Tommy's One-Armed Bandit is a single player slot machine and poker machine simulation.
The slot machine starts the player with $100 and the cost per play is $0.25. It pays out on just six winning lines; one, two or three cherries, three plums, three oranges, or three bars. Any line with a lemon in it loses.
In the poker game the player plays against the machine. Five cards are dealt. The player bets between one and five dollars on the hand and then discards none, one or all of the cards dealt thus far. The game redeals the appropriate number of cards and, if the player has a winning hand pays out a fixed amount. The lowest winning hand in this game is a pair of jacks.
