You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in a rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, the Quavers mascot Colin Curly likes his Quavers so much he lost balance and dropped them down a giant ant-hill. It's now your job to go in, in a mission to solve puzzles and retrieve the snacks for your friend.
Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. Its path is filled with domino-like tiles and closed gates that must get through to find the snacks. You'll have to traverse different themed worlds in order to retrieve Colin's precious Quavers.
The main game consists in controlling the ant from a standard third-person platformer perspective and moving dominoes to place them in a well imagined line, so that when you push the correct one, all of them fall with a specifically marked tile falling last. The door will otherwise stay shut and you will be unable to progress. In addition to that, your ant can't fall from too high or it will die and make you restart the level.
Every domino tile has its own marking. For example, yellow ones are the ones you simply push in a direction so they push the one next to them, most often in a chain reaction. Red ones, on the contrary, can't be pushed at all (but can be moved) and tiles that hit it will fall back in the opposite direction. Other types of tiles include one that explodes when being pushed or hit by another tile, clearing the way for other tiles; one that keeps moving ahead until it hits another tile; one that creates a bridge over a gap; or one that moves straight up and stick to the ceiling, pushing a tile next to it.
Each level is timed and requires quick thinking in order to be completed successfully. Upon completion of a level, the player is given a password that can be used to resume the game at the level they last left off.
The SNES version doesn't have the Quavers branding and involves retrieving drops of cash for a rat character instead.
