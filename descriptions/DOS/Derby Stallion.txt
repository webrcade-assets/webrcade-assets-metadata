The third game in the long running Derby Stallion series. The game continues the tradition of simulating being a stable owner and breeding, training, then entering horsed into a race. Any purse money earned can then be recycled into breeding even faster horses. Training and breeding is very important in this game as the player has no actual control of the horse during a race.This version of the game introduces self breeding mares (generations can be repeated) and a Stakes Race mode.
