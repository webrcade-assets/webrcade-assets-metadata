O.R.B.Y. (Orbit Rebound Bankshot Yaw) is a cross between an artillery game and air hockey, for two players. (Either two human players, or against the computer.) The playfield is a rectangular area with multiple stars scattered around, and a goal area on either side. Each player selects an angle and power to fire their planet at, with the objective being to land the planet in the goal area. Planets can bounce off the outside of the arena, and are affected by the gravity of the stars inside the arena. Also, both planets are fired at the same time, and can bounce off each other. The playfield is rearranged every three turns.O.R.B.Y. was distributed as shareware. While the shareware version was not technically lacking any features, and could be registered as-is, the company also sold O.R.B.Y. Pro, which allows modifying game parameters such as number of stars, goal width, and opponent difficulty.
