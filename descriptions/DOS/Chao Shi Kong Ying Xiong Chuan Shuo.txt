On a lightning and thunderous night, a big red car passed through the rain curtain and stopped in front of the villa.Meng Qi, a young writer, got out of the car and the villa was dark, possibly with a broken fuse.Meng Qi opened his flashlight and went to the basement. Some old things were scattered around.The word "STOP" appeared in a door. Meng Qi hadn't thought about it clearly yet. A bright light came out directly.  When he recovered, he found himself elsewhere.It turned out that he had somehow entered the space-time transmitter and was transported to the planet of Cologne.He is no longer a weak scholar, but a strong person with special skills.Can he uncover the truth and save Cologne's fate? Can he go back to the his world?
