Bloxinies II takes us back to the grinning ASCII protagonist from the first game and his continuing hunt for gems. Once again, the action takes place in a world of puzzle rooms which must be cleared of the precious crystals before evacuating through the exit door, but this time around there are a few enhancements (besides the graphical update from CGA to VGA). In addition to the movable boulders and prowling spiders, we now have several new elements: rampaging rats and drifting demons, switches that cause gateways to open and close, one-way passages, and collectible bombs that can be used to clear away rocky obstacles (and enemies).
The biggest change, however, is the addition of a whole new two-player mode - the black smiley-face can be joined by his white neighbor on the ASCII table, for a simultaneous cooperative romp through the mysterious puzzle world. This takes them to a separate set of multiplayer levels, distinct from the single-player ones. Both sets of levels can now be modified using an interactive editor, and for even more variety, the level set from the first Bloxinies is also included.
