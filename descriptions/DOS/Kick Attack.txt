Kick Attack is a partial conversion for The Ultimate Doom and Doom II that was created with permission and help of id Software to promote RC Cola's Kick brand of soda.
The game casts the player as a quality control manager at a Kick bottling plant who discovers one day that the competitors are using Alpine Spew (a reference to Mountain Dew, another soft drink popular in the 90s) to contaminate Kick. Armed with a pistol and a bottle of the favourite drink, the manager sets off to stop these intruders.
The conversion replaces zombies and demons with various zany characters such as "Surfer Mutants" and "old lounge singers", as well as flying bottles of Alpine Spew with sharp teeth (which replace Lost Souls), all complete with appropriate sound effects. There are no changes to the actual game mechanics, but many textures and sprites are edited, sometimes rather heavily, to make references to Kick.
The game contains one large level that was designed by id Software employee Tim Willits, which culminates with a boss fight against a giant can of Alpine Spew.
The add-on was available for free from the Kick website, and came in two versions compatible with The Ultimate Doom and Doom II, which have no differences except for the title screen art.
