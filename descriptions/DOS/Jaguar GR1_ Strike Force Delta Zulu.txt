Jaguar GR1: Strike Force Delta Zulu is a modern military combat flight simulator that was created with Domark and Simis's Flight Sim Toolkit (FST) construction set. As a British Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot, the player straps into the cockpit of a SEPECAT Jaguar GR1 jet fighter-bomber to fly highly dangerous, dynamic missions against various Soviet bloc aircraft, vehicles and naval vessels. However, the scenario is not that of a military conflict, but is instead set during a fictional joint military exercise between RAF and the armed forces of former communist states, which takes place in a remote, top secret training area deep in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
There are ten missions in the game, each being a separate scenario that was built and runs on the FST engine. Missions are accessed through a graphical user interface added by the author, which also displays mission briefings, online help and other information, as well as allows to view the 3D models of the player's craft and enemy planes. The missions can be played in any order.
