The year is 2020, anarchy and road rage-rule the highways, and only the strong survive as ruthless road warriors prey on passing motorists. You are an Eastern European factory worker, proud owner of the world's last Lada. Your mission: reach the abandoned Lada factory and reactivate it - thereby restoring the glory of the Russian automobile industry, and bringing peace and harmony back to the world's highways.Although you might expect a takeoff on Lotus: The Ultimate Challenge, Lada is a vertically scrolling road shooter in the vein of Spy Hunter. You'll have to maneuver your trusty Lada along the roads through changing environments, carefully control your speed to avoid crashing, and use your machinegun and missiles to get rid of other moving vehicles. Power-ups can replenish your ammo, repair damage to your car and boost your score.
