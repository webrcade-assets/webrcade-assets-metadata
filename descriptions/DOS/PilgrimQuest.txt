Pilgrim Quest is an educational game in which you play the original Pilgrims bound for America on the Mayflower. You must make the perilous voyage across the Atlantic, find safe harbor, pick a place for the new colony, and manage the development of that colony until it becomes self-sufficient. Exploration, diplomacy with the natives and war are all events which must be dealt with as you struggle to grow your fledgling colony in a hostile environment. The game is primarily strategic, but has some action-arcade sequences thrown into the exploration screens such as fishing, hunting, logging, and fur trapping.
