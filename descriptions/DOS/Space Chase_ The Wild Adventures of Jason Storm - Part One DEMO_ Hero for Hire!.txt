This is a pre-release demo of the shareware game Space Chase, featuring one exclusive level called Gateway. The player's objective is to guide the game's protagonist, Jason Storm, through an orbital station infested with enemies, and capture the villain Mr. Big with a shipment of Planet Buster Bombs. The demo showcases basic game mechanics and a portion of the enemy roster from the full game.Although technically a demo, Hero for Hire was distributed on shareware terms. Shareware vendors could make physical copies thereof (usually on floppy disks) and sell at a reasonable price, on the condition that they would replace it with the full shareware episode once that became available.
