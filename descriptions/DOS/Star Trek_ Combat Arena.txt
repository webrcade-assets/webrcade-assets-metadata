Star Trek: Combat Arena is a one- or two-player, keyboard controlled, space combat game. To play against an AI opponent the game must be started with a run-time command in the form "TREK x" where x is a number from 0 to 4. The AI opponent is always the left opponent when selecting a ship at the start of the game.When the game starts each player selects a ship from the eight available: Romulan Warbird, Klingon Battlecruiser, Federation Heavy Cruiser, Andromedan Intruder, Kzinti, Hydran, Tholian and Orion, each with different strengths and weaknesses. It is possible for both players to select the same type of ship and there is also an option to have the game randomly assign a ship. If this option is taken the players will always have different vessels.The game also has an optional planet which allows players to take cover, hitting the planet causes ship damage.
