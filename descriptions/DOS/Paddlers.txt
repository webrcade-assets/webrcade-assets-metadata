Paddlers is ball-and-paddle brick-breaking game similar to Arkanoid and Breakout, but with four paddles instead of one, which can be controlled by either human or AI players. The ball changes colour depending on which player's paddle it touched last, so when it breaks a brick or touches a bonus block (bonuses are activated upon touch, not "caught" by paddles as in other Arkanoid games), the points and bonus effects go to the player with the corresponding colour. The successful completion of a stage is rewarded with points, which are divided equally between remaining players.
Paddlers is a freeware game. Originally, the author offered optional free registration, with registered users to receive a bonus game called LED Buster, but this offer was eventually discontinued.
