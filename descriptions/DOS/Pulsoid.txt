Pulsoid is a Breakout / Arkanoid -type game for one or two players that is inspired by (but is not an exact remake of) the earlier ZX Spectrum title Pulsoids. The objective is to clear each level of all blocks by indirectly guiding missiles into them, but instead of the typical ping-pong balls, the missiles in question take the form of snakes (apparently designed after the "Laserpulse" from the original Pulsoids).Similar to the ZX Spectrum game, the snakes can grow larger or smaller if they break certain special blocks marked with the plus and minus signs, respectively. Apart from this, gameplay features are largely identical to other Breakout variants, including power-ups and power-downs that fall out of blocks and may be collected by the player's mobile platform. Additionally, various monsters occasionally appear on the playing field which may be destroyed by the snakes, the player's platform on contact, or by gunfire if the player has a weapon.Pulsoid has 32 levels with an option to load user levels (an editor is included with the game), and can be played either solo or by two players on the same screen. There is an optional "Arkanoid" mode that replaces snakes with the regular pong balls.
