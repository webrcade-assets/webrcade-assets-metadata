Yet another unlicensed clone of the arcade smash, written in BASIC, where the hungry hero sets out on a dot-devouring dash through a series of mazes. Per the usual routine, he is persecuted by a gang of four ghosts, who set out on patrols from their base in the center (though in this version they rather resemble little ASCII snakes); each maze has four strategically-positioned power pellets, which temporarily turns the ghosts into prey for the player. This version eschews such motivational awards as fruit bonuses, and the difficulty level remains fairly constant between mazes.
