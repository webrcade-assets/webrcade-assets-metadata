Korean shoot-em up game, Soft Action â€™s attempt to redeem itself after the largely unsuccessful Fox Ranger II. The game uses overhead view and pseudo-3D mode not unlike SNES Mode-7, and visual effects are similar to Axelay. Eardis is set in science-fiction universe, and player must pilot a futuristic plane/spaceship, fighting against invading aliens. Gameplay is similar to other shoot-em up games. The difficulty is quite high: best weapons are rare, and many enemies kill player instantly despite having a shield bar. There is a two player mode.
