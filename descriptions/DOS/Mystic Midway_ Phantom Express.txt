Mystic Midway: Phantom Express is a gallery shooter and spin off from the game Mystic Midway: Rest in Pieces. In the game each level represents a period of your life, which is presented as a rollercoaster ride where you are assaulted by various objects from that period (baby toys, braces, etc.). The goal is to shoot as many of them as possible to get a high enough score to advance to the next level. During the rides there's also parts of conversations you can hear where people argue about you or blame you for problems. In between levels you are greeted by an unfriendly host that only tries to insult you.
