Noid is one of several sample games that demonstrate the capabilities of DIV Games Studio development environment. It is a simple remake of Arkanoid with colourful graphics and smooth animations. In particular, broken bricks do not simply disappear but fall down to the bottom of the screen, which, along with falling bonuses, can make it difficult to keep track of the ball(s). Typical for the genre, the available bonuses are marked with different colours and letters, but are not explained anywhere in the game -- it's up for the player to discover their effects. The paddle can be only controlled with the keyboard.
The game was available as a free download from the official DIV Games Studio website.
