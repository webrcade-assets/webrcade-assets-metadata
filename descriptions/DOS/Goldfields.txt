Goldfields is an educational game for multiple systems.
The game is largely text-based with multiple choice menus. You have just arrived by ship at Suze Port. Gold has been found around Fields Town, which is inland. Your player is given options including working in Suze Town, or can travel further inland to Fields Town, or the actual mining fields like Damp Camp or Goldfields to see out your fortune. The goal is to gain as much money, gold, and experience as possible in 1 year. During their adventure, the player must watch their health and legal status. The player can purchase a gun to protect themselves from robbers, and
Starting in Suze Port, the player can choose to work for money to help with their travels, or head directly to Fields Town. In Fields Town, the player can work for the local businesses including the hospital, grocer, hotel, and transport shop. The player can choose to pay extra to become a partner in these businesses, and help expand them. As a partner, every month the player receives money for their investment.
Finally, the player can purchase mining equipment, and head out to make their fortune in the gold fields. There, the player can try alluvial mining, or can purchase a share in the local shaft mines. As an owner in the shaft mines, the player can mine on their own, or can use their investments to expand the mine to make it more profitable. The gold the player mines can then be sold for cash, with a better exchange rate the further the player is from the mines. As the game progresses, the player gains new skills. If the player's health falls to low, they must recover in the local hospital.
At the end of a year, the player can adventure for another year.
