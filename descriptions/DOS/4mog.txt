4mog is a conversion of the board game Connect Four. Both players (there is no AI available) take turns and drop a ball into a 9x8 grid. Each participant has a different color (blue or red) and the goal is to get four of them into a line. As soon as one player has reached this goal, the game ends. The only specialty are the cartoon graphics (the red player is a cat and the blue one a dog) and that fruits are placed on some grids. If a player drops their ball in one of these grids, they receive points.
