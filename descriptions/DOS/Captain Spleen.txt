Captain Spleen is a planet-hopping comedy sci-fi adventure game. It uses keyboard input, but not for typing commands, only for selecting from option menus. The PC speaker is used for sound.
In the introduction, we learn that our hero Captain Spleen is in debt and needs to pay off his loans. The starting location is McScotty's, a fast-food space station. Once we leave, there is a main menu of options: we can choose where to go to next from a list of seven destinations, change the speed that Captain Spleen's ship is travelling at, see a listing of current cargo, communicate with any nearby ships, activate weapons systems, and save/load the game.
