SRAM is the name of a planet that is at the extreme edge of the universe and it is the setting for this French text adventure with pictures.
The story is a familiar one. Cinomeh, the high priest of Sram, has seized power and the royal family has been imprisoned. The people are oppressed but the only resistance comes from 'The Hermit' who combines his powers with the witch Edulac. Together they search for a hero and they found you, the player. During a month of incantations and spells they transferred you from Earth to Sram, atom by atom, and now it's time for action. Can the player free the royal family and restore order?
The game uses the standard abbreviated commands for movement but as it is in French these are N/S/E/O for North/South/East/Ouest-West. The game has built in help and the parser supports conjugated sentences.
