Lucky Seven simulates a turn-based card game, played against the computer. After placing a bet, the player may draw up to seven cards, and their combined value determines the hand's score; the computer does the same, and the highest hand wins. A winning hand of 7 cards will double your earnings, and if you bust (by drawing a card with the same value as the first card in the hand) you'll double your loss.
You may continue until you're out of cash, and if the deck runs out, you're given a choice to either quit or reshuffle. The game is written specifically for the PCjr and requires Cartridge BASIC.
