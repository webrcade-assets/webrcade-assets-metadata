Bust-A-Move is an unofficial conversion of the classic puzzle game. Based on the SNES version, it copies many of its modes and levels, but is also missing some elements.The basic gameplay is the same as in other versions: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the screen that shoots bubbles of random colors. The goal is to fire the bubbles in such a way that they connect to others of the same color. Once three or more of the same color touch, they are removed. The ceiling of the play area continually descends. The game is lost if any bubbles reach the bottom and won once all bubbles are cleared.The single player puzzle mode consists of 90 puzzles. Many of the levels are direct adaptations from the SNES, but without any of the special bubbles like explosive or lightning bubbles. There also is no bonus for quick level completion or making many bubbles fall at once. A password feature allows continuation from the last level played.There is also a versus mode that can be played either against the AI (with six difficulty settings) or against a second player. The goal here is to either clear the field of bubbles first or make the other player fail. Successfully clearing bubbles sends extra bubbles over to the other player.Finally, there is the challenge mode. In this endless mode, instead of the ceiling moving towards the bottom, more bubbles are constantly refilled from the top. There is no way to win: it is played for a high score.
