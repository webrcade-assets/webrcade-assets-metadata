During the reign of the Middle Ming dynasty (15th and 16th century), China was split into several focuses of power and as a result plunged into chaos. The rumor of the secret knowledge known as "five poisons" appeared again. The corrupted chief of secret police, Yan Chongying, befriended the famous pirates Yanmo and Wutian and used his power to persecute brave generals and innocent people. In Western China, in the Uighur (East Turkestan) region, an illegal religion wants to avenge the dead and to prevent Yan Chongying from controlling the entire land. Japanese ships are cruising near the shores of China. Everywhere there are battles, and the future of China is dark. This is where Zhang Zhiqiu, the third pupil of Chaoshan school of kung-fu, enters the picture. Even though he is only twenty years old, and his origins are unknown, he is the only one who can stand against the forces of evil and to restore peace in China.Xiake Yingxiongzhuan is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game set in a concrete historical period in China. The game features hand-drawn graphics and top-down view for exploration. The heroes travel over the world map, entering towns and hostile areas, where the party fights randomly appearing enemies and bosses. The combat uses a dynamic pseudo-3D over-the-shoulder perspective with animated attacks. The characters can attack physically or cast spells which require magic points, in a standard RPG fashion. It is also possible to mine the ground for valuable materials that can be later used to craft items and equipment.
