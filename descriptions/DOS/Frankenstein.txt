Frankenstein is a timed side-scrolling platform game. As Egor Woodenhead the player must collect all the body parts and screws needed to create the infamous Frankenstein's Monster. The game area is divided into four locations - village, cemetery, dungeon and the castle - full of hostile peasants and animals. Contact with the enemies means a loss of energy, same as touching ground spikes and falling from high. They can be killed by jumping on their heads. Egor may carry up two items at a time and supplement his energy by contact with a blond haired woman walking through the village.
