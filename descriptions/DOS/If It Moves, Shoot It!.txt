It is up to you to combat the Korts and free the lost settlers in this classic-style top-down shooter. Newer and more advanced weapons are available the more waves of aliens you destroy. And remember the advice of your forefathers: if it moves, shoot it!
The game is based on the Amiga's Phantom Fighter, reusing the background graphics of that title's vertically-scrolling levels, but with a completely different player ship, enemy formations and power-up system.
