In the future, the resources of the Earth are depleted. Therefore, a giant company named Dynatech is created to secure the demands of Earth through the discovery and development of distant worlds.
The player is a business man who wants to have a share of the huge profits that are to be made by this policy. To achieve this goal, he can buy facilities and spaceships from the Dynatech corporation. The player must compete in the interplanetary market, and sometimes in cooperation with their opponents, to extract the raw materials and develop customer products, food or machines.
The game is very trade-based and focuses on the logistics of a demand-and-supply economy through trading and production, with no further gameplay options like piracy or combat. The game runs in real-time and can be played by two players at once on a computer. It can be compared to the modern Patrician series or the Port Royale series.
