Thunder Offshore is a game that mixes futuristic motor boat racing simulation with a Wipeout-esque touch regarding the ways in which you could disfavour your rivals. It's futuristic, as it takes place in the third millennium, a time where motor boats can dive not just in water, but also in lava, acid and all kinds of dangerous substances. You can test your abilities in no less than 15 circuits, in which you will need to face precipices, make incredible jumps and even immerse in water as if you were inside a submarine. There are at least 10 available weapons (from lasers to torpedoes) to satisfy your most anti-fair play inclinations, but beware, your rivals could use them against you, too. Also, if you're in the mood of playing against humans, there's also a multiplayer mode, which works either by IPX, local network or regular internet connection.
