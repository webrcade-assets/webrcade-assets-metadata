Despite the name, this game is not about the historical crusades. The scenarios in Crusade are fully fictional and in the campaign you spend your time conquering hostile castles.
The graphics are the standard look of round-based tactical games: A map with hexagonal fields. You can use 15 different units, from combat troops to magicians and spies. Other possibilities are ships or even dragons, which have a better attack range than regular troops.
In combat it is not only crucial to have good attack and defend values - the mere mass is important too. That's why you can group up to 50 soldiers together. Additional to the combat you have to ensure of the supply chain with corn by conquering villages and farms or your soldiers will die of hunger instead of by the sword.
In the options you can change several settings to spice up the game. The game features two editors to change the provided missions and create your own.
