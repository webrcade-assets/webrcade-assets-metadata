The Fellowship of the Fleece (aka The Golden Fleece) is a classic parser-based text adventure. The game has a theme of classical mythology: Zeus claims that all humans are mere playthings, while Hermes claims that he can find at least one among the humans whom Zeus would be proud to call brother. And so the bet is on: Zeus challenges Hermes to find a champion who can return the Golden Fleece to him. The game starts with the player finding himself in a dark room, and the goal to find the Golden Fleece, having been picked as Hermes' champion.Despite the classical mythology backstory, the game also relies on some generic high fantasy tropes: the player will encounter creatures such as orcs and goblins.
