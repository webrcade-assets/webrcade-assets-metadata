Gold Mine Run! is a single-screen platformer inspired by classic arcade games. The player controls a miner who must collect all pieces of gold to move on to the next level. Various critters move around the levels and must be avoided. Bonus items randomly appear and can be collected: gems add bonus points, a pickaxe protects from one otherwise deadly hit and keys open doors. There is a time limit of 60 seconds per level - once time runs out, a time monster will appear and chase the player. The game contains 30 levels.
