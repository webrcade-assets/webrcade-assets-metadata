Tommy's Tricks is a shareware, contract bridge playing program. The player can play as any, all, or none (there's a demo mode) of north, south, east and west.
The game automatically uses the Stayman and Blackwood conventions, shutout bids and a weak no-trump overcall.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has options to play 'Open Handed' i.e with all cards visible, a cheat option that allows the game to look at the player's cards, and an autoplay option that lets the game finish playing a hand. It also has optional, basic sound effects.
