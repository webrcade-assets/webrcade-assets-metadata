Adventure Definition Language is a platform-independent programming language for designing text adventure games. It was originally released in 1987, but since it is a freeware engine, there were also later distributions which are already compiled for specific platforms. The releases also include the source code for numerous demo rooms by the original author to show off the language's features. Most important is Aardvark's Museum which is a full-fleshed adventure game.
The game invokes the treasure hunts of early text adventures: the player stands in front of a museum. The goal is to explore and find treasure. This is accomplished by collecting items and using them to solve puzzles. After exiting the game, the player is awarded between 0 and 250 points depending on how much of the game was solved.
