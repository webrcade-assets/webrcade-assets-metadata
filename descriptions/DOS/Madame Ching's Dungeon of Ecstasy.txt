This is a tongue-in-cheek "adult" maze-like game, seen from a top-down perspective. You have been thrown into Madame Ching's Dungeon of Ecstasy (McDoe), and you need to escape. However, you've been injected with some drug that makes your sexual tension constantly and rapidly rise. If it gets too high, you die. The only way to lower it is to have sex. Luckily, the dungeon has a number of willing sexual partners. Of course, they won't oblige you without a condom, but those are strewn about the maze as well. There are also keys to unlock doors, and X-ray glasses to see what lies ahead.
