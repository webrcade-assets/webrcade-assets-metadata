R-Activ is a remake of the 8-bit game Pongo. The rules of this game are simple. Each plan contains a bit of ordinary stones, three diamonds and little creatures. Monsters are hatched of random ordinary stones. The player's task is to submit three diamonds together by pushing them from place to place. Hostile creatures can be crushed with hard stone or by activating electrical wall (also by pushing). Player loses as a result of contact with the monster or by killing all the creatures and the destruction of the eggs - at least one creature or egg should remain on the board.
