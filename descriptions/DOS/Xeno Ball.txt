In Xeno Ball, the devious Gorgo Zola has kidnapped princess Lea Urbana, but our courageous hero, Xen O'Ball, who rather looks like Zool minus the body, jumps into his space ship and goes on an adventure to save her!
The game is split into levels (60 in total), and the goal of each level is to reach the end zone. The protagonist of the story is a ball, and you have no direct control over him; he simply follows the rails like a pinball and never stops. Your only possible interaction is to place different types of tiles on the playing field, like in Pipe Mania, with the ability to select the tiles with the keyboard function keys.
Some tiles will fall off after Xen has passed them, and others are missing from the beginning, forcing you to build a path for him so he doesn't fall into space. You have several tiles at your disposal, which can turn some elements, like fans and flamethrowers on or off, change the direction of travel, teleport Xen to another location or flip him over to a neighbouring track.
A little scene plays between the levels (although these repeat after a few of them), and you are given a password to resume your progress.
