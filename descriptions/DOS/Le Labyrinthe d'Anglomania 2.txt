Le Labyrinthe d'Anglomania 2 is a French educational adventure game in 'Le Labyrinthe' series intended for school children of 11 to 14 years of age.As a young teacher, we are given a task to teach a parrot perfect English so that British princess could give the bird to her children as a Christmas present. As the bird tries not only to speak, but to fly away from the prince's castle as well, we are to embark on a journey visiting Scotland and other places and meeting different people, including elfs and gnomes - while having only 30 days at our disposal. At that we not only choose where to go, but also correct what parrot says grammar-wise, increasing our score and demonstranting our profeciency in English.
