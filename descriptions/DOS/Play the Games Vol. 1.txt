Play the Games is the reaction of the success of Topware's Gold Games 2. Nearly at the same time as the release of Gold Games 3, Electronic Arts, Infogrames, and Virgin Interactive Entertainment released together their own compilation in an joint-venture. Each company contributed five games.The compilation offers 15 games spread over 23 CD's. As is usual, the manuals are on CD as PDF's, while the printed manual is only some sort of reference card.Electronic Arts' part of the compilation:Dungeon KeeperFIFA 98: Road to the World CupFIFA Soccer ManagerNeed For Speed II: Special EditionNuclear StrikeInfogrames' part of the compilation:F22 Air Dominance FighterIndustry GiantKKND2: KrossfireSeven KingdomsThe Feeble FilesVirgin's part of the compilation:Command & Conquer (Special Gold Edition)IgnitionLands of Lore: Guardians of DestinyNHL Powerplay 98Screamer Rally
