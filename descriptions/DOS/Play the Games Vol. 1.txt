Play the Games is the reaction of the success of Topware's Gold Games 2. Nearly at the same time as the release of Gold Games 3, Electronic Arts, Infogrames, and Virgin Interactive Entertainment released together their own compilation in an joint-venture. Each company contributed five games.
The compilation offers 15 games spread over 23 CD's. As is usual, the manuals are on CD as PDF's, while the printed manual is only some sort of reference card.
Electronic Arts' part of the compilation:

Dungeon Keeper
FIFA 98: Road to the World Cup
FIFA Soccer Manager
Need For Speed II: Special Edition
Nuclear Strike

Infogrames' part of the compilation:

F22 Air Dominance Fighter

KKND2: Krossfire
Seven Kingdoms
The Feeble Files

Virgin's part of the compilation:

Command & Conquer (Special Gold Edition)
Ignition
Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny
