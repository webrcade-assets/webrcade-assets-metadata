In Galactic Empire you play as a secret agent of the titular empire. On the planet Ether, a civil war has been on-going for 3 years. A hunter called Voltar, leading the Scarlet Militia, have overthrown the imperial friendly government and installed himself as the dictator of the new regime, with nasty results. The empire isn't happy about this, least of all because Ether, owing to its harsh climate is heavily reliant on imports, itself only inhabited thanks to its medically and militarily useful wildlife. You are sent in under the cover identity of Ted Fost, a reporter for the "homeo-newpaper" Cosmopolis.
Your objective is to figure out the strengths of the various pro and anti-imperial factions, along with the cause of the revolution. The last agent, who mysteriously disappeared, sent one final clue. "It's the Malkouts fault."
Galactic Empire is an unusual cross between FPS and adventure game. You get a wild variety of weapons and plenty of targets to use them on, but you are not an one-man army. Instead you have to chose when to apply violence and when to think or talk things things out. In addition to the usual array of adventure puzzles, the game features an emotion dialog system, you get 5 options to use in conversation with the many, many NPCs.
