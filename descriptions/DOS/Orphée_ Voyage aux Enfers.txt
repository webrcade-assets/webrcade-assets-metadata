It was a hot day. You were returning from a business trip in your sports car. The contract had not signed and you were upset. You sped up your car using its turbo-compressor, lost control and crashed into a truck. You survived, but just barely. You had fallen into a coma. During three years your soul was trapped in a strange place known as the Inferno.
In this game the object is to escape the Inferno. You must explore, interact with characters, as well as collect and use inventory items. Above all, you must not fall into Satan's hands.
