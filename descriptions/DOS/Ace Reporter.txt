Ace Reporter is an educational game for multiple systems.
The player is a reporter at a local news agency, and their job is to find out the important facts of a story including, who, what, when, where, when, and how. To do this, the player receives a message via teletype and then must call the appropriate people or organization to put the story together. Once the facts have all been placed on the player's notepad, by choosing keywords from the available clues, the story can be submitted to the editor.
