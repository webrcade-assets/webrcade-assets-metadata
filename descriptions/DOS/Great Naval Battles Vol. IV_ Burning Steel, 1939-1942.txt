A naval surface warfare war game set in the European theatre of World War II. The player may play in a series of independent scenarios or quick skirmishes with the main bulk of the missions consisting of alternate, rather than historically accurate missions (though still available) in which the player may even get to command the Russian navy. The game includes a scenario editor that allows the player to deploy up to 50 ships per side.
