PCTris is a Tetris-style falling block game. The base game features a high-score table, sound and music. The game also has a 2-player mode, where two players play at the same time. (If one player loses, the other can keep on playing to get a high score.) It also has a Blob variant. In this mode, success does not come from creating lines, but from creating blobs of the same color. If a large enough blob is created, it will be destroyed, giving points. Also in this mode, falling pieces will collapse as soon as they hit the ground.While PCTris was released as freeware, there was a Windows-only shareware release under the name LomTRIXX. The shareware version only allowed playing through the first three levels.
