Super Get'Em All is an action game similar to Pac-Man or Lady Bug, where the player assumes the role of a ladybug who has to pick up a certain percentage of items in the level before an opening appears in the walls at the edge of the level to allow progress to the next. Each level has different types of enemies that kill the ladybug when touched, and some levels feature special features such as bouncy walls that reverse your direction of movement upon touch. At the end of each level, the game tells the player the percentage of items that have been collected.
Movement happens with the arrow keys. Pressing an arrow key once makes the ladybug move into the arrow's direction at normal speed, pressing it a second time increases the speed to high. Pressing the arrow key that goes in the opposite direction makes the ladybug stand still, moving into the opposite direction requires another press of the arrow key. But moving in a ninety degree angle from the current direction is instantaneous, without stopping the ladybug in its tracks.
While the enemies and special features of a level are manually set, the level layouts are procedural. When the player dies and attempts the level again, its layout changes.
