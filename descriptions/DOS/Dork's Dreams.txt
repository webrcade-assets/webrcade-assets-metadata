Dork the Dinosaur settles down for a nap beneath a Triassic tree when a thunderstorm stirs up, frightening him.  A lightning bolt hits the tree he's sheltering beneath, dropping a branch on his head and knocking him out cold.  While he's unconscious, he dreams... that he is a character in an eight-level platform game.
Each level has a fixed goal -- to reach the exit without touching enemies -- and some levels will feature distinctly non-prehistoric objects (springs, harpoons, bombs, balloons) for assistance in achieving that goal.  Otherwise all Dork has going for him is a little dino shuffle and a little thecodont hop that unfortunately can't be used in conjunction with the shuffle.
