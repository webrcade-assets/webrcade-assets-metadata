Put your ingenious strategies to good use in Cunning Football. However, your involvement doesn't end there. If you're on the offense you'll control the player with the ball and then after the snap you'll control the QB, then the player passed to etc. On defense you'll control the middle linebacker. The players, seen from a top down view and represented with letters for their position (L for Linebacker), can intercept, tackle, pass laterally.
Before any play you'll get to choose from a menu as to what strategy you'd like your team to try and then see a menu that will show you what you should be trying to do according to that play. This same menu will show you the positions that key players on your team will be taking. A keyboard, mouse or joystick can be used to perform your winning moves on the field and to select plays.
