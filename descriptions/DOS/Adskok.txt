Adskog is an unofficial adaptation of Адскок (1990) for the Russian computer Vector-06C. In this version, the gameplay remains faithful to the original, with levels loosely based on the original design.The game features single-room levels that must be crossed unharmed to progress to the next level. These levels are constructed vertically, so after moving from left to right, the main character uses a ladder to reach an upper platform and then proceeds to walk to the left. Unlike traditional platformers, there is no jumping involved; the primary danger comes from enemies that move up and down. Successfully bypassing these enemies requires precise timing, as once the character starts walking, he only stops after climbing a ladder. However, players can change the horizontal direction of movement at any time.Upon touching an enemy, the player loses a life and instantly respawns at the start of the level. If all lives are lost, a password is provided, allowing the player to resume from the last reached level.
