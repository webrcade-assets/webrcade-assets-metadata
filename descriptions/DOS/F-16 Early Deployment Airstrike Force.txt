Your craft: an F-16, complete with 7 air-to-ground missiles and 300 fuel units.  Your mission: go on a sortie over hostile territory and destroy enemy installations, by launching your missiles directly above target.  The action is controlled from a non-scrolling side view; each sector contains an assortment of targets, obstacles and traps.  You can clear a sector instantly by engaging your thruster, although this gulps down quite an amount of fuel.
Ammo and fuel may be replenished at the floating resupply depots.  Run out of gas, or collide with anything at all, and your fighter will crash and burn - you only get two lives to rack up as many points as you can.
