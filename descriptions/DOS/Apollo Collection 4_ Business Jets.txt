Apollo Collection 4: Business Jets is a set of sixteen aircrafts in an add-on package, requiring the 3rd-party application BAO FlightShop, to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator v5.x.
The included aircrafts are:* Beechcraft 1900C

Beechcraft Duchess 76
Canadair Challenger 604
Cessna 152
Cessna 414 Chancellor
Cessna Citation X
Dassault Falcon 900
Grumman GA-7 Cougar
Gulfstream IV
Gulfstream V
Hawker 1000
Piper PA-23-151 Cherokee Warrior
Piper PA-23 Aztec
Piper PA-31-310 Navajo
Piper PA-44-180 Seminole
Piper PA-46-350P Malibu Mirage

There is also an (optional) updated IFR panel for the Beechcraft King Air included in the add-on. The Beechcraft 1900C found in this add-on was developed from the King Ar, and it has almost the same cockpit, so it would fit well.
The documentation suggests to use this cockpit with all BAO 2-4 turbine engine aircraft, instead of the generic one. Cockpit installation is done by running a batch file, King.bat.
