3D-Ball is a two-player game where players use a paddle to throw a ball against a wall. When it bounces back, the next player has to use the second paddle to bounce it again. This continues until one of them screws up and the other player gets a point. While one player is active, the other paddle is locked and can't be moved. The match is over when the score is either 0:11 or when one player reaches 21 points.There is also an endless one-player mode available where a penalty point is applied every time the player misses. After 100 points, the counter resets.
