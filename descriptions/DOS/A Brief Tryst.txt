This was supposed to be Fruitsoft's groundbreaking strategy game.  It's a complex future war strategy game which uses many "time-travel" features that make the game unique.  Anytime a past event was changed too drastically the play would branch off into separate universes and the player would try to win in the largest number of possible universes.
