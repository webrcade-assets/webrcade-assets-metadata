Slot simulates, as its title suggests, a casino slot machine: the player starts with a balance of 0, and spends a single coin on each pull of the lever (a negative balance is allowed). The three wheels are spun, and the resulting 3 fruits on each wheel determine the payoffs, if any. It is possible to play indefinitely, and to end at any time; other commands allow selecting a new random number seed, and an "auto" mode which goes through 100 consecutive spins at a time.
