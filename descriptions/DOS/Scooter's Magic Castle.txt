Would you like to have your own castle? With lots of chambers, secrets, puzzles and activities to do? Well, Scooter now owns such a castle, and he's very eager to see what he can find inside! And he can find quite a lot.
Scooter's Magic Castle is an education game where you control Scooter, and by clicking on various items in the Castle you can interact with them, often starting a small mini-game. The activities available around the castle are numerous, ranging from simple memory tests to composing your own melody.
During his travels around the castle's corridors, Scooter is assisted by a helpful owl, who acts as the game's options menu and can also teleport you to any chamber.
