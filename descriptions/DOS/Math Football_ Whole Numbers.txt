Math Football: Whole Numbers is a 1 - 2 player educational math game for multiple systems.
Each player controls a football team, and must successfully answer math questions to complete plays. There are 4 levels of difficulty from high school, college, professional, to super bowl. The game is divided into four 15 minute quarters, and each game starts with a kickoff. The play clock continues to run down, and players must answer as quickly as possible, having only 60 seconds to answer each question. The offensive team can choose a short play, medium play, long play, or to punt. Depending on the difficulty of the play, the player receives a harder math question. Players gain more yards for a correct hard answer, but stand to lose more yards with an incorrect hard answer. The defensive team must answer questions to try to push to computer back.
