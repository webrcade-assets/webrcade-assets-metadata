Sink The Bizmark is a one or two player implementation of the traditional game that used to be played with pen and paper but which is more often played as a board game these days.This implementation gives each player a carrier, destroyer, battleship, PT boat and a submarine which must be placed on a 10x10 grid. Ships may be placed horizontally or vertically on this grid by specifying a start co-ordinate and whether the ship is to be placed Up, Down, left or Right from that point. Ships can be repositioned if necessary, they are not locked into place until the player presses ESC. When both players have placed their fleet they take turns to fire at the other player's grid. If it's a hit the player is informed. All tiles that a ship occupies must be hit, before a ship is sunk. The first player to sink all the other's ships wins.This game also includes a quiz based on the US Navy. The player is shown ten questions and a selection of nineteen possible answers, the task being to assign the right answer to each question. They may change their answers to any question but each answer can only be used once. When all questions have been answered the player presses ESC and the game lets them know how many questions were answered incorrectly. The player can opt to continue and repeat the quiz, the answers from the previous attempt are preserved, until they get all questions correct. Only then can they proceed to the next level.
