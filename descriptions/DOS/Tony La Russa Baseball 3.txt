The 3rd installment in the Tony La Russa Baseball series. This sports an array of new features and improvements for both arcade-action fans and baseball strategists and statisticians.
The response time of all input device options has been optimized to improve the reactions of the on-screen ballplayers. From pitching and hitting to running and fielding, gamers will now enjoy quicker, more responsive interaction when playing the game.
With the new pitcher/batter matchups, specific confrontations between each pitcher and batter can now be simulated even more accurately, with an expanded database of stats reflecting each pitcher's and batter's tendencies versus any opponent they've faced during their careers.
In addition to providing detailed play-by-play and color commentary for each game in the "action (arcade) mode" as they did in Tony La Russa Baseball 3, the game's veteran announcers, Mel Allen, Lon Simmons, and Hank Greenwald, supply more realism than ever by referring to each player by name when pitching, batting, fielding and baserunning.
Two "universes" of data-final 1995 season stats and 1996 Spring Training rosters-are available when simulating a single game, an entire season, or multiple future seasons in the "General Manager Challenge" mode.
New stat categories have been added, which help define each hitter's performance in specific situations, such as: runners in scoring position; pinch-hitting appearances; and other critical circumstances such as close games in the late innings.
Clutch performers like Wade Boggs, Mike Piazza, Barry Bonds, and Don Mattingly are now portrayed more faithfully than ever before.
