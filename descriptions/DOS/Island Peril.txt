Island Peril is a first person shooter with full motion video sequences. The enemies are all digitized sprites of actors and will taunt you individually if they are able to kill the player. The player is able to walk, jump and slide in a full 3d environment as well as interact with switches and secret passages in walls. The player starts with a pistol but is able to pick up other weapons including a shotgun, machine gun, flamethrower, bazooka and a water rifle. Powerups include armor (represented by a raincoat and a gas mask), an additional backpack ammo and keys to open up doors. Coins can also be picked up and spent at vending machines which will dispense some of these powerups.
