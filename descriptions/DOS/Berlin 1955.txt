Berlin 1955 is a combat flight simulator that explores a hypothetical alternate history scenario where the Soviet Union attacks West Germany in 1955, and NATO forces mobilize to repel the invasion. As an F-86 Sabre pilot, the player is given various assignments that range from attacks on enemy ground and air targets to providing cover for friendly bombers, escort and formation flying missions.
The game was created with Domark Software's Flight Sim Toolkit and sold as shareware. The full version has ten missions, with only three available in the unregistered shareware version.
