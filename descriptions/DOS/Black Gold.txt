In this managerial simulation you work as a coal miner, and build up your coal empire.
The game starts in 1900 and ends normally in 1933. One round in the game is like 1 month in real-time. You start with a small amount of money, buying workers and materials for your own coal miner career.
You can choose from 3 difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard) and several aims in the game: building up a predetermined cash limit or predetermined coal limit, or play any chosen amount of months.
You can carry on sabotage, cause mine disasters, demoralize the mine workers and more to beat your opponents (human or computer).
