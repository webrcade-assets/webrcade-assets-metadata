The Crusade is a 1-player fantasy-themed strategy game for the Amiga and DOS.
After a trip abroad, the king and his entourage have been told they can't enter their own castle without the royal key.  Played on a screen that scrolls in all directions, on each level the goal is to navigate the king to the key and unlock the door. A smaller display map of the whole level is shown in the top left of the screen.
The character can control seven types of characters which can be moves in the cardinal directions.  There is one king per level, who can only pick up keys.  On each level, the player may have a number of queens who can use bombs, serfs who can build bridges, mirrors that reflect, lasers that shoot, archers that can fire at a distance, and knights that have a powerful attack.  Before a player can build a bridge, throw a bomb, or fire an arrow, the player must pick up the appropriate items.
If the player shoots their own characters they are killed; there are also hidden pits and traps which must be individually searched for.  The player has limited time to complete each level.
