Cyberstreet is a first-person shooting tech demo of Criterion Studios' RenderWare 3D engine. Armed with a Doom -like chaingun with infinite ammo, the player appears in a small alley with the objective to clear it from rats that spawn at regular intervals. The rats roam around randomly but try to run away if hit by gunfire. The game is over once all rats are gone.
The player is controlled primarily by mouse with some keyboard keys acting as mouselook modifiers, and can look in any direction and also crouch. Additionally, there is a demo mode where the camera slowly flies around the alley. One of the doors in the alley leads to a secret room with an animated human figure walking around.
