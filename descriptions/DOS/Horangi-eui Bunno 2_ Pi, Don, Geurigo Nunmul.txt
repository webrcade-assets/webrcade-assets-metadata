Horangi-eui Bunno 2: Pi, Don, Geurigo Nunmul ("Rage of Tiger 2: Blood, Money, and Tears") is a sequel to Horangi-eui Bunno, Korea's first fighting game. There are two modes in the game: story and "dual" (versus) mode. There are nine controllable characters, but three of them are not available in the beginning, and only the three main heroes (Hanin, Kent, and Mangho) can be controlled in the story mode.Rather than having combination attacks and special abilities, the game assigns six different keys to various moves. Gaining the upper hand in battle depends on using the right moves against the right opponent. All the graphics in the game (except the characters' life bars) are monochrome black-white.
