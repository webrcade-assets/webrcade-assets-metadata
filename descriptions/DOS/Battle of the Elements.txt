Long ago, the elements (Lightning, Fire, Air, Earth, Magma, Rock, Slime, Plant, Water, and Snow) battled for dominance.
This is an Othello -style game; 2-4 players, (depending on the board selected; either human or computer) will take turns either duplicating a piece, or moving a piece two spaces. However, this game has a third type of move available. By moving a piece onto another piece of the same player, they will combine into a higher-level piece. Pieces can only be turned by a similar or higher-level piece. There are no gameplay differences between the elements.
There is also a Fox-Hunt mode that is a puzzle game. You control a single piece, and try to reach the exit square in each level. Trying to stop you are a bunch of opposing pieces, but there are trap squares on each level, which will destroy any piece that lands on them. Because the enemy pieces will move directly towards you, you can trick them into landing on the traps. There are 70 levels.
