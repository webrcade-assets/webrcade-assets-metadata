Maine State Trivia is a shareware, quiz game for up to four players where all questions are about he American state of Maine.This is a 'Trivia Shell' game meaning that the basic trivia game software was used to produce many games by the load screen and question packs, there are twenty-five 'Trivia Shell' games in the accompanying catalogue while the exit screen advertises yet more diverse subjects including as other states, DOS 5.0, Sports, Novell Netware, and 'The Metaphysical'.As this is a generic game the description of this game is very similar to others in the series, the only difference between this and, for example, Hawaii State trivia is the reference of a Gold version on the shareware reminder screen.The game has three levels of difficulty which it applies to the same question pack. For example when asked a question on the Beginner setting the player would be given an answer and a pair of True/False buttons; the Intermediate setting is multiple choice and the player would have to choose from four possible answers; and on the Advanced setting the player would have to type in the complete answer. There are sixteen question categories ranging from History to Military and the when setting up a multiplayer game it is possible to choose specific categories for each player.
