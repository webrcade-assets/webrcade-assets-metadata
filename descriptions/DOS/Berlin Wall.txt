Berlin Wall is a shareware, two-player, strategy game whose game-play has elements similar to Tetris. It is entirely keyboard controlled.
In this game the players are presented with tetris-like pieces that appear at either side of the play area. Using the keyboard they must place their pieces and build a vertical wall across the screen. When a solid line has been completed it is removed, the player who constructed it scores points, the remaining pieces shuffle along towards the centre of the screen and the game continues. It ends, as in a game of Tetris, when no new pieces can be placed onto the screen for one of the players.
The game has ten levels of difficulty with each level introducing new shaped pieces. There is a high score table and optionally obstacles van be introduced into the game area to make wall construction more difficult. Additionally the game speed can be varied and the action keys can be redefined.
