NFL Challenge is a football simulation game. The game can be played by two players, one player against the computer, or the computer can play against itself (it is also possible to switch between human and computer players at any point in the game). Whether controlled by human or computer, each player selects one of 28 NFL teams and acts as the coach and needs to make various decisions to ensure the team can win games. In addition to calling plays during a game, as the coach the player needs to decide which team members will play in a game, call time outs, and deal with injuries and substitutions. The 28 teams included are based on the most recent stats at the time the game was released; all of the team and player stats are stored in plain text files allowing the player to edit them for new stats over time or create imaginary teams. On systems with color graphics the game will show an animated version of each play from an overhead view with X's and O's representing the players. Included with the game are extensive guides on offense, defense, and an NFL playbook.
