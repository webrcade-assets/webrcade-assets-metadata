Mission's End: A Personalized Adventure Sample is a text adventure. You play as the captain of a large but unimpressive spaceship, who will be exploring the spaceship.
This is a promotional game made to advertise a line of personalized adventure games. These are adventure games, but the names of various characters and objects are replaced with the names of various people, pets, and things in the player's own life. (This is done through the ordering process, not at run-time.) Mission's End: A Personalized Adventure Sample shows this off with, say "PLAYER'S HOME TOWN", or "YOUR BEST FRIEND" in the text instead of the names those would be replaced with in a full game. This game could be freely distributed.
