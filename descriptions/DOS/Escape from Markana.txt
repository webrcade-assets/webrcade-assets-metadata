Escape from Markana is a single-player "escape the maze"-type game. The player takes the role of a hero who has been taken prisoner by the nation of Markana. After a long and intensive interrogation the Markana leave you alone in their maze. They are so certain that their obstacle, trap and puzzle laden maze is impenetrable that they leave no guards around so all the player has to do is escape. 
Further evidence of their pride in the security of their maze is the fact that they also use it to store treasure and the odd gun. Points are scored for each object collected.
