Astatin is a puzzle game where players recreate a pattern displayed on the right-hand side of the screen. To achieve this, players place stones on a grid by clicking on specific fields. Once a stone is placed on a neighboring field, previously positioned stones transform in both form and color. The order of stone placement varies with each level and is indicated at the bottom of the screen. Players must solve each level within a time limit; failure to do so results in the loss of a life. When all lives are depleted, players either restart from the beginning or re-enter at specific levels (5, 10, 15...) using a password.
