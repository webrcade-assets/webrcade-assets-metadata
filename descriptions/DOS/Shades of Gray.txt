Shades of Gray is a single player text adventure that has nothing to do with the adult"Fifty Shades of.... series of books. This is a collaborative work by people from the USA and England who only met on-line and never actually met in person.The player awakes in a strange place with no memories and apparently surrounded by vampires. They escape and gradually recover their faculties via a series of tarot cards and time travelling visions.The game has one hundred and eighty rooms/locations and a perfect score of one thousand. It is possible to die in this game but there is a manual save function that can mitigate lost progress.
