It's the updated version of "MicroLeague Baseball" from 1984, enhanced in every aspect. The game allows you to manage your favorite baseball team, selected from 26 All time greatest teams, included in the game. You can also create your own team or even league. Game is played turn-based, against computer or other player. You can select every choice, from pitcher, lineout and every command during play, or you can make it all automatic if you want. You can also "fast forward" any match, if you think that it's enough for you. Game simulates all team members progress (or regress) and their physical conditions, so you can use the same team in long game series, making the best team.
