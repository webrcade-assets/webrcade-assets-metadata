This edutainment game teaches users about counting, adding and subtracting in six activities with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. Four of the activities indicate numbers with objects, while the other two use numeric digits. After successfully completing an activity, the player is rewarded with a join-the-dots activity with a choice of five different dinosaurs or the rocket game in which they can customize a space rocket to launch. After the rewarding activity, the player goes back to the six math activities.
