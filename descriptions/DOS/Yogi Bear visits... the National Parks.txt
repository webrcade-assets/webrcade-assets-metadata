While Yogi was taking his nap under a tree, Boo Boo wandered off to another national park. Playing as the part of Yogi, you must find the whereabouts of Boo Boo. Mr. Ranger, with his ranger radio and computer, is the only one who can help you besides the park maps in your hand. You will need to ask Mr. Ranger to use his radio and computer to get a brief description of the missing bear's last sighted location and find the national park on your park maps that matches the information. Then you have to fly the helicopter of Mr. Ranger to the park and see if Boo Boo is still there.
The game also lets you review the information of all the the National Parks and print out some quizzes without launching the main game.
