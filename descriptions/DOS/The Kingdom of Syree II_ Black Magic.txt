The Kingdom of Syree II: Black Magic is the sequel to the role-playing game The Kingdom of Syree. Like its predecessor, it bears considerable similarity to the early titles in the Ultima series.In Black Magic, the player resumes the role of the Lord Champion of Syree, who, having defeated the evil wizard in the first game, returned to the life of a simple farmer. This peaceful existence however is interrupted when the news come that the Keeper of the Power has passed away. The Keeper is a person responsible for all the mystic powers in the realm. When a Keeper dies, the power is immediately transferred to a newborn child. This child must be raised as a good person for magical powers to be available to everyone, but if the Dark Forces find the child first, the balance of magic power will be upset. So the Lord Champion prepares for another journey to save the kingdom.Unlike the first game, The Kingdom of Syree II is shareware and requests registration from the player. However the unregistered version is not limited in any way except the delay upon loading with the message urging the user to register. There is an optional sounds pack which allows to use Sound Blaster sound effects and music instead of PC speaker sounds.
