Katie's Farm is a sequel to McGee. Like that game it is an educational game for young children that is entirely wordless so that it can be played independently without assistance from an adult. The gameplay is identical to the first game but this time it takes place at a farm and McGee is joined by a second character, his cousin Katie. The farm consists of a few different locations (barn, paddock, hen house etc.) and for each there are four icons to click on which cause the two characters to interact with the environment in different ways. This includes meeting different animals (cows, horses, chickens etc.), playing with a scarecrow and jumping in a haystack. There's no end to the game so the player can explore the farm freely.
