This is a short graphical adventure, where the player is tasked to navigate mazes to eventually retrieve the scepter of Queen Jennifer.
The player starts out in an open landscape in the kingdom of Kyrule. Nearby our starting location, the open mouth of a cave is gaping invitingly. There is another cave on an island in a river close by, and the Queen's castle is further off on the other side of the river. To cross the river we need first to find a raft, which might be hidden somewhere in the nearest cave. There is a monster somewhere, guarding the queen's scepter, but we have a sword. When entering a cave, you get an overview of the maze so you can try to remember the layout, before zooming in on your hero.
This game is a first attempt by the author to make a graphical adventure, and source code & documentation is available for a fee.
