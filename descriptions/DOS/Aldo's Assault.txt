Aldo's Assault is the third game in the Aldo series of platform games. This title leads through ten more boards of jumping and running. Aldo has to reach the treasure chest on each stage in order to proceed to the next one, while avoiding the falling and tumbling barrels which drop out of the chutes. Getting hit by a barrel means instant loss of one life, as does running out of time. The clock can be extended by collecting bonus items found on the stages, and any remaining time is added to the score at the end of each stage. Levels are cycled through repeatedly with ever-tighter time limits, until the player runs out of lives.
