In Splitterwelten a whole solar system was bombed. Now the splinters of the five planets are floating through the space and are inhabited by rival clans who have no other goal than to claim the whole splinter for themselves. The player controls one of these clans.
Both the player and the computer have several characters to their disposal. The goal is to shove all enemies from the splinter. But of course they fight back. So the strategy of choice is to nudge an enemy with two people. He can't fight back to both and gets pushed to one side. Besides the standard fighters there are strong and fast characters. The strong ones can push two enemies at the same time.
Hillsides bring another tactical component on the table: A downwards pushing character has an advantage to his enemy. With time the edges of the splinter brake away. There are 50 levels to solve. In the multiplayer mode are another 50 levels played with a second player. When beating both modes a level editor is unlocked.
