IQ Master is a Tetris variant. The game takes place in the same manner except that the player does not stack bricks but words. Words that need to be formed are shown on the right side of the screen. The correct spelling indicated at the bottom of the screen needs to be selected from different choices by using the left or right cursor keys. The game highlights a part of the word the player needs to decide on. If correct, the selection is deleted, if not, it remains. During the game bombs are used to destroy some of the letters arranged on top of each other. The game has two levels of difficulty - practice and tournament. It provides the option to create a custom dictionary in any language.
