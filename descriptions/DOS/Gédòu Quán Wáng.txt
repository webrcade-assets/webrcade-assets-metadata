Gédòu Quán Wáng is a traditional side-scrolling brawler where the player controls a character moving from left to right. The objective is to defeat enemy mooks by using kicks or punches. Once all enemies are vanquished, the path opens up, allowing the player to advance to the next fight. The game consists of five levels, each divided into stages with distinct backgrounds. At the end of each level, a boss awaits the player. Although the story is minimal (with only an intro and an outro), it revolves around the hero’s quest to rescue a kidnapped girl.
