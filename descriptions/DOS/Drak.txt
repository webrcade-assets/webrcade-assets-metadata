Another Tetris clone. In the phantasy world reconstructed after decadence, the favourite game was Drak - a game where you have to eliminate lines of blocks flying from the top. This game allows you to practice or complete the Conquest, ultimate goal of Drak, which consist of 100 stages. You have to eliminate lines until indicator turns yellow. Also bombs are flying from the top. Sometimes obstacles and other difficulties can be on the path of the flying object.
