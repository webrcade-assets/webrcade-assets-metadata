In The Awe-Chasm, the player takes the role of Snatch and Crunch which visit the Awe-Chasm in search for treasure. And that is also the whole extent of the background story: the goal is simply to find all treasure and earn all 500 points.In order to solve puzzles, the player writes sentences into the parser. The player can switch between the two characters which have different abilities (Crunch is a "monolithic mutant" and Snatch a "pokey pervert") and can interact, e.g. Crunch can pick up Snatch. This is required to solve some puzzles. The game features sexual humour.
