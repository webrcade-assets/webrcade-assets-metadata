Broadway is a 1-player simulation about putting on a Broadway musical.At the start of the game, the player must use their previous track record to raise $1,000,000 from 8 investors to start putting together their show. The previous track record is random, and the player may not be able to acquire sufficient funds. If the player acquires $1,000,000, they can start the process of putting together their show.The player must put money upfront to hire crew and a place to practice. The player then chooses a wide variety of people to work on the production, including actors, the director, set designer, costume designer, lighting designer, and more. Each of these come in 3 talent grades, with progressively higher cost for more talent. The player must choose the quality and seating capacity of their theatre, as well as investing in sets, props, and costumes.After this, the player enters a 5 week rehearsal period, after which they receive reviews on their production. A poor production is doomed to failure. Each opening night, the player chooses to spend advertising on their production, and controls the ticket costs. The goal is to recoup the initial investment costs over a period of the next few weeks.
