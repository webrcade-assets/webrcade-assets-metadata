An adaptation of Berzerk, taking place in a series of scrolling maze-like rooms; you are beset by rampaging armies of aliens and robots, and have to try and take down as many as you can with the aid of your trusty handgun. Both you and your enemies can fire in eight directions - metal walls will deflect any shots that strike them, while the colored barriers are destructible. The more enemies you kill, the more you'll score, although it is possible to leave the level at any time by heading towards an exit. Both the overall game speed and the fire speed can be adjusted on the fly.
