Corrupt! is an interactive fiction game with high resolution EGA graphics, divided into 5 parts/chapters and framed within what in literary terms we would call a black novel.
In this way, the player takes the role of an FBI detective who must try to dismantle a powerful gang of drug traffickers, finding the evidences to stop the biggest suspect before the arrival of the next big shipment of cocaine.
In another order of things, it's necessary to comment that the game doesn't let the player save the game in course. To supply the lack of the save option, when the player will finish a chapter, the program will give a password that will let you continue from that point.
