The third part of the Blood trilogy, this game is set at the very dawn of time: Mere nanoseconds after the Big Bang. This is where the time-travelling shenanigans of the second game ended up. Now you, Commander Blood, are the only evolved lifeform in the entire universe, and it's up to you to correct the problems you've caused and guide the development of all other life. You start the game with a few amoeba-esque creatures at your disposal. Find a planet to put them on, then take care of them, help them migrate to other worlds, evolve and mutate.
Big Bug Bang: Le Retour de Commander Blood uses the exact same interface and many of the same graphical sequences as its predecessor Commander Blood. It is a surreal, galaxy-spanning, humorous sci-fi adventure.
