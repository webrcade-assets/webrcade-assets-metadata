The blast from each explosion clears one or more blocks and occasionally uncovers a bonus item.The objective of the game is to clear a path through to one's opponents and catch them in a blast thus killing them. Players have three lives and can only lay one bomb at a time.There were ten levels in the shareware version which has no single player option and no computer controlled opponents.
