Master Mind, is, unsurprisingly, a Mastermind game. This distinguishes itself by using fruit instead of colors. Options include the number of spaces to guess (5–7), the number of different fruit (5–9), whether multiples of the same fruit can be present, and the level. The level affects the hints displayed. At level 1, the game will highlight the fruit that are in the correct space. At level 2, the game will show which fruit were guessed correctly, though not the correct spaces. At level 3, the game will display the number of correctly guessed fruit as well as the number of correctly placed fruit (traditional rules).The game is single-player only. It does not have a maximum number of moves. It also comes with a Hint button that reruns your last guess at level 1, displaying which fruit are correctly placed.The game was distributed as Shareware, but with no restrictions.
