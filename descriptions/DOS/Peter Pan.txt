This is the story of a boy who wouldn't grow up...
In Peter Pan, you, somewhat, follow the story of Peter and Wendy.
In the Darling children's bedroom, you must click the various objects to find Peter's shadow.
Next, everyone flies to Neverland and you see the island's map. Click the item that moves, which is the Indian village.
Here, you must navigate a watery maze, gathering floating items. Be careful that the Indian brave in his canoe doesn't catch you or you'll lose a life.
After that, it is off to the Lost Boys' village. You must run a maze, gathering flowers, while avoiding a pirate.
Then, it is off to the Mermaid Lagoon. You must click on each mermaid so Peter can jump rocks to get to Wendy.
After that, you move to a tree with a playhouse. You must click around to find the hiding children, like hide-and-seek.
Finally, it is off to Captain Hook's ship, the Jolly Roger, where you must run a maze, avoiding three pirates, to get to and rescue Wendy. This will send Hook packing and win the game.
