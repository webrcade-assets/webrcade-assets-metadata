Urban is a puzzle board game. Urban and Marf walked along the beach at night. Suddenly Urban sank into the ground. Two mysterious figures commanded him to pass the maze in black glasses. Marf became his eyes.
Using the barriers the player must protect his friend from the death and allow him to get out of the maze. After setting barriers Urban starts continuous march by a defined direction - a) if he can't go ahead, he turns to the right, b) if he can't turn right, he turns left, c) if he can't turn neither to the right nor to the left, he returns. The exit doors open after collecting all the mushrooms. The player may use two types of barriers - solid or disappearing under the touch. Each level of the maze consists of a few chambers. To get to the next level of the maze, it is necessary to find the key. Urban must avoid the poisonous mushrooms, electricity and bottomless holes. Contact with them means an instant death. Electricity can be turned off by a switch, a bottomless pit can be covered by a barrier. The game includes numerous additional components, such as: spring (sends two squares forward), teleport (moves to another part of the board), arrow (allows you to move only in designated direction), lever (changes the direction of the arrows), crossroads (send in the desired direction), crown (turns off most of the obstacles), trolley (transports at the end of the track). The player receives WARX for completing each level of the maze. WARX can be exchanged for additional barriers or omission of one of the boards.
The game features 102 boards all together and has built-in chambers editor.
