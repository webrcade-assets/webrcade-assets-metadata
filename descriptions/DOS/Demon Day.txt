Demon Day is a funny medium-length adventure game inspired by titles like Zak McKracken, the Monkey Island series and Maniac Mansion.
Waking up from a weird dream our hero finds himself involved in a strange plot including possessed telechubbies, demons from other dimensions, friendly neighbours, a walk in the park and a kid that tyrannizes the local playground.
It will require some skill and a great deal of attention to clues for our hero to sort out the great mess and save the day. The game is packed with humorous dialogue and bizarre events that make solving the often perilous and absurd tasks more than worthwhile.
