Pro-Play Blackjack is a 1–7 player blackjack game versus the dealer for DOS.
Follows standard rules found at most Las Vegas Strip casinos. All cards are graphically displayed on the screen. 1–7 players take turns drawing cards from a pile with the goal to get as close to 21 without going over.  The player wins the hand if their final score beats the computer dealer.  The player must play the same bet each hand.  If the player and dealer tie all bets are off.  Blackjack pays 3 to 2 odds on the bet.  There are options to split, double, surrender for half the bet, and call insurance if the dealer's first card is an ace.   The player can ask for prompts after incorrect play to learn better blackjack technique.  Bankroll, decks in play, and shuffle technique are all modifiable.
