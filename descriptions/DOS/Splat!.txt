Local ants are keen to take your sugar cubes. Fortunately you are armed with a fly swatter, which can be used to squash them. Move it around the screen and hit each ant before it can drag a cube off the screen. On each level you have a target minimum of cubes to protect. There are also levels with no cubes - these see the ants moving faster than usual, and you must squash as many as possible, with a bonus based on your percentage success. The game's sampled sounds are used to give a comic and home-brew feel to proceedings.
