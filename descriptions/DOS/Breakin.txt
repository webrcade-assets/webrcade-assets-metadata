Breakin is a Breakout variant for one or two players, with very few deviations from the classic formula of the genre. The player's objective in each level/screen is to break all blocks by hitting them with a ball that bounces around and can be directed with the player's paddle. The ball bounces off walls and the blocks that it hits, constantly changing its direction. Should the player fail to deflect the ball and it falls through the bottom of the screen, the paddle is lost. If no spare paddles are left, it's game over.
Some blocks take more than one hit to destroy, and some will drop various powerups (and possibly power-downs as well) that the player may catch with the paddle to gain a temporary advantage, such as a ball that breaks through any number of blocks without bouncing off of them, or extra balls, or laser cannons on the paddle which may also be used to destroy blocks, and so on. As is traditional for the genre, the powerups are marked with different letters of the alphabet, and players are left to discover on their own which does what. Additionally, there are moving creatures that regularly appear from the top of the screen, that roam around randomly and may be hit by the ball for extra points, but will also change its direction as it bounces off upon impact.
Breakin was sold as shareware. The registered version includes over 50 levels, a level editor and the option to access any level by entering a code in the main menu.
