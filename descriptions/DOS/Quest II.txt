Quest II is a top-down action/puzzle game. While attempting to steal from Lord Seventeeth, you were caught and thrown in prison. Now you have to escape a large maze, filled with traps, enemies, and puzzles. Levels consist of multiple screens. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the level.Elements seen in the game include: Enemies, which patrol a fixed path and will kill you if you come into contact; bombs, which let you destroy one wall or one enemy; keys, which let you pass through one door; blocks, which can be pushed either out of the way or into a pitfall to go over it; and pitfalls, which kill you. There are also puzzles based around finding an item for a person, who will either unblock a path, or will trade you for a different item.Quest II was distributed as shareware. The shareware version only has the start of the game; the registered version has 56 screens.
