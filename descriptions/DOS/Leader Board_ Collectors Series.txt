Leader Board: Collectors Series is a budget compilation release of the DOS game World Class Leader Board and its three Famous Courses expansions. That makes the content fairly identical to the 1992 release World Class Leader Board: The Series.Both releases contains the same version of the game (v5.50) and the three expansions, but this version allows you to play the expansions slip-streaming into the main game, using one copy, while World Class Leader Board: The Series requires three copies to access the three expansions. In addition to this, the Lasersoft release has different graphics for trees and bushes in some courses.
