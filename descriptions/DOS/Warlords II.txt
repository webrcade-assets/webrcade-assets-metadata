Warlords II is a 2D turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. The player is a commander from one of several races (like the people from the Kingdoms, the Dark Elves, Ussyrian Orcs, Sirians etc.). The player starts with one city, and must capture other cities (enemy or neutral) to produce new units. The creation of a new unit itself takes a certain amount of turns. The player organizes warriors into "armies" (groups of units, shown as one icon on the map, like the heroes in the Heroes of Might and Magic series) and lead them into battles. The units differ in the number of movement points they possess, but the armies are only as fast as the slowest unit in them. Battles are resolved automatically, the player cannot affect them.
