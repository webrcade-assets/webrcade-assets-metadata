LOVEDOS is a simulated DOS prompt puzzle-like 'joke' program where your computer has suddenly become obsessively infatuated with you. The fake DOS prompt responds intelligently to a number of DOS commands and keystrokes and has its own repertoire of friendly little comments. In order to finish and exit the program, you need figure out the right thing to say to your lovestruck computer.
