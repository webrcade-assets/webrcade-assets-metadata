The ever-popular card game receives another computerized treatment, this time at Buck Mann's casino.  The player gets the option to cut the deck, places a bet, and the basic rules apply: five cards are dealt, and any of them may be replaced once to get a better hand.  Hands are ranked in standard order - one pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush; achieving one of these will return or multiply your bet accordingly.
Here, aces are always high; after each hand you get the chance to bet on the next card's value, double or nothing.  If you go broke, you can either see "Sharky" for a loan... or get a less-than-friendly farewell from the staff.  You may open an account with the casino to have your player stats saved to disk (using the same player name in a later session will retrieve them).
