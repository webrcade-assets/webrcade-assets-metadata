The player controls a small frog which must jump across lily pads towards its goal. These lily pads gradually grow smaller and eventually sink into the water, with new lily pads replacing them. There are also enemy bugs chasing the frog. Touching these bugs or the water results in death. Bonus points are awarded for collecting colored balls. As the levels increase, the game speeds up and lily pads become smaller.
