Let the warty, mangy, cat-eating ALF teach your children the fundamentals of logic!
The game is set into three lessons: the first has the child leading ALF to the Tanner household's cat Lucky, via a route of minor logic problems (such as 3 roads with stoplights, one is green...which road leads to the feline snack?). The second brings the concept of "and/or" to children, using colorful shapes; point out the correct answer using ALF. The third involves shape/color sorting according to the criteria ALF gives you.
