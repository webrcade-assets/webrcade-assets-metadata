Lomax ColTris combines Columns and Tetris in a single package. The respective games are called "Col.ums" and "T.tris" in the menu, perhaps to avoid copyright infringement. Each can be played at one of five, progressively more difficult skill settings, with the higher ones adding new twists to the standard rules, like rockets that fly around the playing field in T.tris and randomly flip falling tetromino pieces. Each game is played in several rounds, with the player score adjusted after a round for any pieces left on the playing field.Both games recycle many of the sprites that are found in other Lomax Software games, such as StoneBreaker and Lomax Boulders.Lomax ColTris was sold as shareware.
