Wham! is a fast arcade game for two players, with a computer or a human opponent through split-screen. The player controls a ship flying in caves trying to destroy your enemies with weapons and bonus add-ons. Opponents fly in the small cave with different spaceships. Some ships are fast but also quite weak, and some ships are slow but they have a lot of energy and power. Players can also design own space ship or cave level.
Ships have weapons such as main cannons and special weapons. Special weapons vary a lot, some of them are very powerful, but at the cost of accuracy and firing rate. Some are very quick to shoot, but don't deal a lot of damage. There is also one weapon which can guide you to the goal. The game contains 60 special weapons, 12 cannons, 10 bonuses and 30 different levels.
