Swapper is a tile-matching puzzle game. You are given a grid of tiles, and need to match up tiles of the same color. When tiles are matched, they disappear. However, tiles can only be swapped with adjacent tiles, and matched tiles will create holes in the grid. This means that unless you're careful, you can get into an unwinnable situation, where it's not possible to match up the remaining tiles.
