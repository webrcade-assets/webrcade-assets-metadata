Dragcity U.S.A. is a single-player, shareware, drag racing game where the objective is to achieve the fastest time possible in a drag race.
The game is mouse or keyboard controlled and there's not much sound other than that of a base thrumming when the car accelerates. Gameplay is simple and basically consists of trundling up to the start line, waiting until the green light shows, then accelerating through the gears as fast as possible and continuing the acceleration through to the finish line. Within a couple of runs for practice, each race takes around eleven seconds or less.
The game keeps a record of the best time of each session but there's no high score table and the race time from one session is not held over to the next. To improve the race time, the player can tinker with the car's gear ratios.
