Tetris Gold Professional is a basic protected-mode DOS Tetris game from 1998, distributed with DOS and Windows installers as was typical for Windows 3.1-era DOS games. There are no options and no difficulty selection. Level 2 chooses from more than one background image, music track, and a set of pre-filled blocks when you reach it.In addition to the "selections from MOD Archive" music that the game itself uses (MOD files with ".TPM" file extensions), the disc contains a full album of techno mixes in Redbook Audio (CD Audio) format.
