Kraptor is a free, open source vertical-scrolling top-down shooter that pays homage to Cygnus Software's Raptor: Call of the Shadows. The background story told via an CGI animated intro cinematic reveals that in the future, the world is ruled by a powerful tyrant with an uncanny likeness to Bill Gates. Many people are unhappy with this and an uprising starts, with the player cast as a mercenary pilot who aids the rebels against the oppressing empire.Gameplay is quite similar to Raptor : the player's ship is initially outfitted with a weak gun with unlimited ammo, but better weapons, other equipment and repairs may be purchased between missions for credits earned during a level. The player is confronted by numerous enemy fliers of different varieties, and can also destroy ground targets, all of which yields additional credits. Some ships also drop useful powerups when destroyed. A typical level ends with a boss battle.Kraptor was developed as an open source game and is distributed under the MIT License. There are ten levels in the game.
