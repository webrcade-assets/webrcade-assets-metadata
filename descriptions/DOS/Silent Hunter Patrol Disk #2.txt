The second add-on disk to the submarine simulation Silent Hunter features similar content as the first: there are two new patrol zones for the career mode (the waters near Hong Kong and Vietnam) and 15 new scenario missions.There is also an entirely new feature - a scenario editor. It allows the creation of a multitude of missions. Any patrol zone can be used as the setting. Submarines, military and trading ships and aircraft can be freely placed. Many variables can be set: weather, time of day, experience of ship crews and bomb load of aircraft. The pre-existing scenarios can be loaded into the editor and changed as well.
