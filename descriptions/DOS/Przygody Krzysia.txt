Przygody Krzysia is a simple platform game, where the player may only walk, without jumping or any other activities. The goal of each chamber is same - gathering all the treasures scattered on the location. Contact with bats and obstacles takes some energy level. Falling from the high is completely painless. Numerous doors may be opened with the keys. The main difficulty is picking direction - wrong choice may finish in a blind alley. The game features 31 levels.
