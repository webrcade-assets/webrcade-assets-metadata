Siege of Gondor: Middle Earth Tale 1 is an unlicensed freeware title set in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. It is a simple RPG where the player controls a single character and has to liberate the city of Calembel from dark forces that besiege it. The game is set several years after the war of the ring, so its story stands as a sequel to Lord of the Rings. The RPG systems are extremely simple, with only attack and defense strength as stats, and conversations consist of NPCs talking at the player and occasionally giving a Yes/No question.
