In the sequel to Test Drive, the general idea of driving a car remained the same with pretty much similar visuals, however the game itself was enhanced in many areas. You can play against the time or the computer on 20 difficulty levels (the easiest include automatic gear shift). The gameplay animation is much smoother, less jerky and the collision detection was greatly improved (including crash sound). There are also changes in traffic cars behaviour and police cars (you can escape them and they are visible on the road when you are warned about their vicinity so you can react). The game also contains a progress indicator of your trip/race. To finish a stage, you must stop at the gas station by yourself, which allows you to refuel. In a basic version (so called Master) the player may choose between a Ferrari F-40 and a Porsche 959, and take on your opponent, who is in the other car.
Each stage has a different setting, including forests and mountains, with a wide range of hazards to dodge. You may also free roam outside the road where it is possible. The game is designed to allow for scenario disks and a new set of cars.
