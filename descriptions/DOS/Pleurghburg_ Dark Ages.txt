Created using Chris Jones' Adventure Game Studio, this detective non-linear story with multiple endings uses an interface very similiar to Sierra's old point & click adventure games.In the year 2012 Jake McUrk, a 30 years old detective working for the Police Detective Agency, is put on a case that seems to be just another minor false alarm. All of sudden, Jake is thrown into a nightmare where danger lurks around every corner. During perilous investigation he finds out what exactly is going on in the city of Pleurghburg.Very bloody, this game is not recommended for kids or even adults...
