A fixed-screen platformer featuring a snowball as the title character, trapped in a series of caves where the chief dangers are fire-based - an unfortunate twist for Joe, as might be guessed.  Each level must be finished by hopping, skipping and jumping your way to the very top of the screen, and grabbing as much loot as you can along the way.
Instead of lives or a health bar, your score doubles as your life meter: you win points by picking up collectibles, lose them by running into a fire or some lava, and if your score ever drops down to zero, it's all over.  Often there's no choice but to go right through those heat hazards, so survival means planning your route and keeping a healthy score balance.
