FBI Fred is a shareware, side-scrolling, action game in which the player controls the eponymous Fred and aids him in his investigation. The object of the game is to discover an access code.

To do this Fred has a gun and a laser, both of which have just five shots each. This is a single-person game, it has a high score table and is entirely keyboard controlled.
