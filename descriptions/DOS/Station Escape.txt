Station Escape is a sample first-person shooter/adventure game that was created to showcase the capabilities of the ACK-3D (Animation Construction Kit 3D) engine. This open source engine is comparable to that of Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold : there are textured walls, floors and ceilings, but all walls are limited to the same height and only turn an 90 degree angles.
As the title suggests, the game takes place on a space station, from which the player must escape before the time runs out and the station's orbit decays. There is one remaining shuttle, but it needs to be repaired first by finding several spare parts scattered across the station. To complicate things, there are hostile astronauts lurking around (whose presence is not explained) that attack the player at every turn. It is possible to shoot back, but care must be taken not to hit the viewports, which will result in immediate decompression and game over. Shooting solid walls will leave scorch marks, which is a rather unusual feature for a game engine like this.
Station Escape may be controlled either via keyboard keys or with the mouse, similar to many eary-90s role-playing games, for example The Elder Scrolls: Arena : moving the mouse cursor towards the edges of the screen determines whether the player should walk or turn, and pressing the left mouse button moves or turns the player in the direction specified.
