The god Liar has risen. A dark ritual has been performed, and a new religion has taken control of the land. Garwell is the last surviving member of an order of knights that is now persecuted as heretical for denouncing Liar and his ways. He must escape his captors, travel the land, and find a way to stop the cult and restore the glory of his order.Sin'geom-ui Jeonseol 2, also known as Liar, is a Korean-made role-playing game and a follow-up to Dream Traveler. Despite its Asian origin, the game is somewhat closer to the Western than the Japanese format, visually resembling Ultima VII and containing characteristic elements such as a vast continuous overhead world that can be explored in a non-linear fashion, limited dialogue choices, and side quests. Like in Ultima VII, combat takes place in the same area as the exploration, is in real time, and involves clicking on the enemy to attack physically or selecting spells. Even though up to four other characters join Garwell on his quest, the player can control only one, while the others are handled by the AI.
