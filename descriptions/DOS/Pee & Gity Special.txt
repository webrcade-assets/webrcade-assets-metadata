Pee & Gity Special is a sequel to Pee & Gity. Visually, the game is nearly identical to its predecessor. The two heroes also retain their moves and abilities. However, the sequel allows players to move the protagonists through a scrolling stage step-by-step after all enemies on the screen have been eliminated, similarly to more typical brawlers such as Double Dragon, and unlike the predecessor with its fixed screens.
The gameplay follows closely the standards of this subgenre of fighting games: up to two players fight wave after wave of enemies, clearing the screen to move on, restoring their health by breaking objects that hide energy boosts, until reaching the final portion of each stage that ends with a boss battle. The buttons for each player (attack, jump, and special move) can be remapped at the options screen.
