This issue of the monthly software subscription contains two games: Kid's Kards and FourSide. It also features a system slow-down utility (called SpeedBrake) which happens to be written by John Romero. The issue's scrolling menu is also filled out with some articles (including a review of Qix), clip art and some non-game software.
