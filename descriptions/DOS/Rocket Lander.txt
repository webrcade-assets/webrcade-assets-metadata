Rocket Lander is a conversion of the arcade game Lunar Lander. The object of the game is to land a space craft on the landing pad while avoiding the mountainous terrain. This is accomplished by adjusting the thrust and tilting the rocket left or right so your rate of descent is slow enough to land safely. The rocket crashes if the rate of descent is too fast, or if it misses the landing pad. After reaching 100 points, advanced mode begins which features more difficult terrain.
