Hurdles is a single player side-scrolling game in which the player flies a space ship along a narrow corridor. Along the corridor are bonus points with a value of +1000 or -1000. The objective is to build up a high score by collecting all the positive scores. As the player progresses through the levels the they get harder with obstacles, the eponymous hurdles, which must be avoided while collecting points.
There is no shooting in this game. The only controls are those which move the space ship up and down the screen.
A trainer level and three game levels are available in the shareware version of this game with more promised on registration.
