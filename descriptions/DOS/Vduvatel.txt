Vduvatel is a Russian game known as Вдуватель that is a two-player, keyboard controlled Tetris variant.Player one controls their game with the J/K/L while player two uses the 4/5/6 keys, these perform left, right and rotate actions - there does not seem to be a key that moves the blocks down the screen quickly. The game has no help file or in-game instructions, the high scores are not preserved and the only sound is a kind of whistle when one player's stack of pieces reaches the top of the screen.
