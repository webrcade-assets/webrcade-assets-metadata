Similar to its predecessor Der Planer, the player is the head of a transport company which can be a courier service or a forwarder which transports goods from point A to point B. Additionally the company can branch out into cognate businesses such as a bodyguard service, car rental or sightseeing tours. It is possible to open divisions in Central Europe, USA and Scandinavia. The winning conditions can be set before beginning a new game, e.g. the number of opened divisions, market share or profit.
The main aspect of the game is similar to other managerial simulations: Employing personnel, getting orders and setting trip routes for the vehicles. Some routine jobs can be ceded to computer controlled managers. The main menu is a building with several doors - every door leads to a menu screen, e.g. the telephone exchange, were the according actions can be carried out. Every action costs time and at the end of the day the turn is over.
Additionally there are two action sequences which can be disabled: A scavenger hunt were the player drives with his car through a city and searches ordained locations. At the end he has to answer a trivia question and win prize money. The other game is a robbery of a money transport were the player sedates the robbers by shooting them with a cross hair.
