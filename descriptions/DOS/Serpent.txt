Serpent (better sit down for this) is a Snake game. As our elongated hero roams the enclosed playfield in search of food, it must take care not to double back, run into the walls, or chomp off its own tail. Every piece of food you collect increases your score, as well as your length. You have to pick up five of them to clear each room; the first room is free of obstacles (except for the surrounding walls), but later rooms thwart you with additional barriers.
On advanced levels, you'll encounter enemies that bounce around the arena. These are lethal if you meet them head-on, but worse than that, they may steal your food - which forces you to lose a life before you can finish the level.
