Voyager is a first-person action game that challenges the player to explore the levels of an alien spacecraft's maze. The environments consist of corridors and rooms done with 3D vector graphics. The protagonist has to evade robots programmed to blast any intruders. To win, the player must destroy all power generators and escape (or hunt down and annihilate) the killer robots.
