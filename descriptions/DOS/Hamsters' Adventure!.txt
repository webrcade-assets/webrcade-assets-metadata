In Hamster's Adventure, the player takes the role of Mr. Hamster who has to save his girlfriend from rats and other rodents. In order to do so, he needs to travel through 11 levels which can be freely explored with the exception of walls and other static obstacles. The goal in each level is to collect all fruit by walking over them.From a technical perspective, this is a 2,5D action game played from a first-person perspective. In order to get rid of attacking enemies, Mr. Hamster has two attacks: a melee attack and shooting strawberry grenades. Those have to be collected first and have a blast radius which hurts Mr. Hamster, too. This and enemy attacks reduce Mr. Hamster's energy bar - running out results in a game over - which can be refreshed by using biscuits found in the levels. They are saved in an inventory and can be used when necessary. The last move available is jumping: holding the associated button longer results in a higher jump.
