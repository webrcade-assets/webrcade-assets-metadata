Hariboy's Quest is a point-and-click adventure where you play as Hariboy who is sucked into a painting in his room into the fantasy world of Bonbonia. It is a promotional game for Haribo candy. An evil dragon has destroyed the candy formula contained in a chest, but there is a copy spread across three books in different worlds (medieval, Roman, and wild west). Hariboy must retrieve these. However, Jack, the one eyed man, and his gang of pirates are also wanting their hands on them as well. Along the way, he encounters characters which are advertising mascots for Haribo. The game has SVGA graphics and there is some pixel-hunting of items on occasion. It has 250 locations with dozens of puzzles to figure out.
