Protec is a single-table pinball game themed around upgrading a PC. You can improve the processor type, the frequency, and the memory. Improve the computer enough, and you can unlock "protected mode" (multiball).Protec was released as shareware. The shareware version lacks a high score table and 4-player mode. It also restricts the player to 2, instead of 3, balls per game.The game was also released as Protec2, which added digitized sound and music.
