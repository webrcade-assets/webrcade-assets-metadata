In Metalizer the player takes the role of Val Gordon whose goal is to defend his home planet Tress from an invasion. For that reason he travels through the country Djelassia to put together a team with four metalizers, combat robots similar to BattleMechs. The story is told in Full Motion Video with a length of one hour.
Basically Metalizer is a real-time strategy game without base building which focuses on the combat. But the player can pause the game at any time to give orders. Accuracy and amount of damage are based on the stats of the pilot and the equipment of the robot. Combat experience results in higher capabilities of the pilots.
Besides the main character the player can choose his companions - there are 50 with different abilities to choose from. Of course the player has to pay them with the money he earns during the missions or in arena fights. Besides new pilots this money can be spent on upgrades for the 20 metalizer models.
