Treasure Hunt Math is an educational game that teaches basic math, fractions, decimals, and percents at multiple skill levels. Your objective is to find treasure that sunk with a pirate ship. This is done by progressing through four stages. In each stage you will collect objects to find and solve math problems. In stage 1 (top-down) you drive a boat around to collect bottles. In stage 2 (top-down) you move around a beach to collect shells. In stage 3 (side view) you collect falling coconuts. In stage 4 (side view) you collect falling treasure underwater. After each stage you can collect extra objects to increase your score in a bonus stage. There are no math problems in bonus stages.
There is a problem editor to modify or create math problems.
