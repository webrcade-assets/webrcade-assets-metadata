Andromedas Erbe is a German shareware adventure and sort of a sequel to Mission Supernova. This time the player takes the role of Peter Platon, a private detective who has to find out the whereabouts of a missing spaceship. His search leads Platon on many planets. The protagonist of the predecessor, Horst Hummel, still has a role as secondary character.The controls follow the traditional SCUMM style: the player combines verbs displayed on the bottom on the screen with objects in the game world or the inventory to issue commands. The game features both inventory and logic based puzzles, e.g. sliding puzzles. Additionally there are mini games like a Tetris variant to solve. When leaving a planet, the coordinates - finding them is the objective of many puzzles - for the next have to be typed in manually. The graphics are a different from its predecessor: it is still played in first-person, but the backgrounds are rendered, inventory items are shown as pictures and there are some animated scenes.
