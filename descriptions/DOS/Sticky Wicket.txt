Sticky Wicket is a single player, shareware, cricket management game based on teams of the English cricket league, Essex, Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Northants, Nottinghamshire, Worcestershire, and the mighty Yorkshire.The player plays through an eight week season of forty-over cricket with a three round playoff for the Sticky Cup at the end of the season. The player selects players from what looks to be real squads from the 1980's, and plays against the other teams. When fielding they select which order the bowlers bowl and the field placings, in this mode the game shows highlights of the over. When batting they decide when the batsmen should run, consequently the game shows every ball of an over.The game is entirely keyboard controlled and the registered version has save/load functionality which the shareware version does not. A two player game, similar to this, was offered when the registered version of this game was ordered.The source code for this game can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/marcardar/sticky-wicketWebsite: https://cricket.marcardar.com
