Jurassic Spelling is a single-player, shareware, educational title with a dinosaur theme to make it appealing to children.
The game encourages correct spelling by providing visual and audio rewards for good work. It keeps record of past homework assignments and allows new words to be added to its library. Users can even record their own voice pronouncing the new words for use with the product.
The rewards are a big feature in the game's documentation. With every option enabled the game will spell each word on screen one letter at a time with each letter being spoken as it is displayed. When the player spells the word correctly the game will play a short but happy tune and when twenty points, or fifty depending on the game setting, have been achieved the game will display a pretty picture of a dinosaur.
When the game is registered the purchaser was sent a voice recorder that allowed them to use their SoundBlaster to record their own pronunciations of words.
