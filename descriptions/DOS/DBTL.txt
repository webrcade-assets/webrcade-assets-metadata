DBTL is a promotional manager game for the 10th anniversary of Down By The Laituri, a Finnish annual music festival in the city of Turku.
The player is given free hands to organize the next DBTL starting from booking real bands to perform, setting up stages, advertising budgets, ticket costs and taking in account the weather conditions.
The game was designed to be a simple ad, and thus it isn't a very deep simulation. A normal "round" consists of setting up the festival and pressing the Go button after which the player is presented with a diagram showing how well the festival succeeded. Success in the game is directly measured by profits.
