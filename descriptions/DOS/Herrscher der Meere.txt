Herrscher der Meere ("Ruler of the Seas") is a traditional German business simulation. The player trades goods, explores ports or becomes a pirate. First the player needs to buy a ship out of five different ship types. Then some goods need to be acquired in order to become a trader. The game proceeds in real time and makes it possible to see other ships sailing on the map. In friendly ports the player can build factories to produce one of the sixteen types of goods. The battles are also in real time. Defeated enemy ships can – when not destroyed – be taken possession of.
