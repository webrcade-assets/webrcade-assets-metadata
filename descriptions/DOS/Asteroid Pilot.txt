Asteroid Pilot puts you at the helm of a rocket ship, and your task is to plot a safe course across the asteroid field. Your rocket moves to the right at a fixed speed, and is constantly pulled down by gravity: your only control is the Shift key, which applies upwards thrust.
Each asteroid field has a randomly chosen difficulty level, which determines the amount of asteroids (and space dust) you'll have to dodge. Crash into a floating space rock, and you're history; hitting a dust particle will just reduce your maneuverability, but you can restore it back to normal if you bump into another one.
