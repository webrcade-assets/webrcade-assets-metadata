Popcorn is a Breakout -style game. The goal is to destroy bricks with a ball that bounces off a paddle the player controls. The layout of the bricks is different in each level. Some bricks are indestructible, forming areas that can "trap" your ball or force it to bounce off in a sharp movement, making it more difficult to hit it with the paddle. Other bricks take several hits to break. There are also enemies which float around the bricks and will deliberately redirect the ball. The player has a certain amount of lives; each time the player lets the ball fall off the screen, a life is lost.There is a variety of upgrades (letters that fall down when the player breaks certain bricks) to use in this game. Those upgrades are:* E - The paddle is extendedL - The paddle can shoot lasers at bricks and enemiesC - Glue is poured over the paddle, allowing the player to catch itT - A ball will split into three. This happens even if you already have three balls onscreen.V - The player gains an extra lifeS - The ball slows downM - All the enemies stop their movementF - A floor appears that prevents the ball from falling off the screenI - The ball impacts an invisible wall, sending it into the opposite directionThe player is immediately transported to the next levelR - Any power-ups the player has are removed.An editor is included which allows the player to create their own levels.
