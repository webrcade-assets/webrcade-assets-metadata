MINEFIELD is a Minesweeper game; uncover a grid, where each square marks the number of adjacent mines. This one features mouse control, three levels of difficulty plus a custom size, a high score table, and a hint button (that will mark a safe spot).For those used to the Windows version, this version doesn't ensure that the first square uncovered is safe, and doesn't let the player uncover all adjacent mines with a left+right mouse click, but it does automatically reveal adjacent spaces whenever there are 0 adjacent mines.The game was distributed as Shareware. Registration provided save/load functionality.
