After the happenings of part II, the player reaches the Necromancer's former domain: the Black Lands of Bakarok. The task at hand is finding a way to the tower and using one of the items found in the Necromancer's palace to stop whatever evil is happening there.
In order to win the game, the player needs to solve puzzles by collecting items (the inventory can hold six) and entering commands into the parser. It supports most commands and abbreviations found in Zork. Like in those classic adventure games, the player can die and render the game unwinnable with certain moves. Resource management includes thirst, hunger, air (when underwater) and lamp power.
This game is second part of the Legacy of the Necromancer series. Although all three parts were released simultaneously and share the same gameplay mechanics, they could be purchased and played individually.
