Å»mija is an adaptation of the classical concept of snake games. The player has to guide a worm through a labyrinth. The player must feed the worm to score points and gain access to the next board, however feeding the worm makes it grow longer. The worm loses a life when he bites its own tail. If the worm manages to eat all the apples and reach the exit doors, he will be transferred to the next level. The game contains several additives to facilitate the completion of the board, such as: spring (allows you to jump over the tail), conditioner (reduces the snake size), missiles and more.The game features a total of seventy levels.
