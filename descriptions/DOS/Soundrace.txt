Soundrace is a 2D platformer in German made as a promotional game for the Fuji cassette tape. Choose between two protagonists (female and male), three difficulty settings and a Normal or Turbo speed mode. It has simple platformer gameplay, collecting points, power-ups and fighting bosses across five levels with a 90s electronic music soundtrack.In your search for hip sounds in cyberspace, you have unknowingly stumbled into the nasty cyberlord MEGABLAST. To get back to your own world, you must traverse through five dangerous zones, defeat the portal guardians and face MEGABLAST in the Magic Zone.Thankfully, there's a high quality FUJI cassette tape in each zone, and armed with your trusty tape recorder, you can record beats scattered across the zones and use them as a weapon against enemies and bosses. Playing back beats creates a small area of effect and in order to do damage, you need to stay dangerously close to your enemies. Unlock the portal areas by finding a switch in each zone, then face the portal guardian by playing back the recorded beats and opening the portal once they're defeated.Many dangers await you in your adventure across the zones. Enemies will drain your tape recorder so you'll need to collect batteries to replenish its power. The tape recorder is also vulnerable to fall damage but collecting repair tools will fix it from becoming permanently broken. You also only have a few minutes to finish each zone, so keep an eye out for clock power-ups to add 25 seconds to your timer.
