Leygref's Castle is a remake of Wizard's Castle.The gameplay is very similar to the original: Explore a castle (represented as an 8x8x8 cube), kill the monsters and grab the treasures to find a powerful item. You do this in a turn-based manner by entering short text commands. Each room of the castle may contain a monster (which will probably result in a simple turn-based combat), a vendor where you can buy and sell things, or special items with random effects (books, magic pools and chests). If you're intelligent enough, you can also cast spells.Small extensions have been made, for example, there are two additional classes at character generation and more monsters. The game also has enhanced text graphics and a more intuitive interface -- for example, the room contents are not indicated by just one letter like "D", but by short words.The gameplay may seem simplistic at the beginning, but winning the game involves using right strategies which monsters to attack, when to cast spells and the right use of the items and special places.
