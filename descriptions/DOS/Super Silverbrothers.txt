A side-scroller similar to Super Mario Bros. and Lode Runner, written by Ken Silverman. You play as Ken (with a little K on his T-shirt) and must reach the exit to each level, represented by a star. Enemies will fall down from the top of the screen and try to kill you, you can crush them by jumping on them. You must also avoid other dangers such as flames. You can collect green gems for bonus points. You complete the level when you touch the star at the end. Contains 4-bit EGA graphics, smooth scrolling and animation, and mouse/keyboard support.
