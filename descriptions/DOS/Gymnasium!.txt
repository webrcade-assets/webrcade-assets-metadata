Gymnasium! is a single-player text adventure.
In this game the player is at school, it's the end of the school day and the last lesson was a strenuous stint of physical education. You hit the locker room and head for the showers as the school bell rings to indicate the end of the school day. However when you finish your shower and re-enter the locker room you find that all your clothes and possessions are missing!
Thus begins the adventure, a search for the missing clothes, which must be completed in secrecy because if you are discovered by Mr. Mean finds you will be suspended from school. The standard means of moving around are used here, i.e. N/E/S/W for north/east/south and west, along with take, drop, open, close, go and a couple of others. There are just over twenty rooms in this game, there is no sound and no save feature and it is possible to 'die' - i.e. fail the game by being discovered.
