Pic Trivia is a 1â€“4 player trivia game for DOS.
Players take turns randomly choosing squares on a 10 x 10 board.  Squares can contain a trivia question worth a specific number of points, a free square, or can reveal the underlying picture.
If the player receives and correctly solves a trivia question, the underlying picture is revealed.  With trivia questions, the player is presented with possible answers, and chooses whether they think the answer is correct or not.  As squares are solved, the underlying picture reveals a word puzzle that describes the answer.  The player also receives letters as they solve the puzzle which help answer the question.
For each puzzle there are a limited number of questions, and bonus points are received if the word puzzle is solved before too many questions have passed.
