Kingdom O' Magic is a fantasy adventure game spoof - along the lines of Zork but with British humour. Play as either an unintelligible Green Lizard Guy (use subtitles) or the token female - who was intended to be humorously overproportioned although now Tomb Raider has raised the standard.
The designers intended for the game to be non-linear, and many NPCs wander around the entire map getting into fights with each other.
Entirely comedic - the troubleshooting guide in the manual discusses sexual malfunction. The dialogue trees encourage the player to be abrasive and confrontational - not doing so will cause you to miss out on much of the enjoyment, and many of the puzzles.
