Enigma is an individual release by B&N of the "Enigma" table from Epic MegaGames' classic Epic Pinball. The big selling point about B&N's games is they were run or installed directly from the floppy disc by just typing 'GO'.
This table features two flippers, a swirly colour changing background, gravity wells and balls with different colours and properties. 
As part of the Epic Pinball series of games it also has the regular Epic Pinball innovations like a scrolling table and a dot-matrix lookalike display as well as music.
If other games from the Epic Pinball series are installed in the game directory they are automatically detected and included in the game's menu system. 
The game is entirely keyboard controlled.
