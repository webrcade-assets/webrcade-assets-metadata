Revolt of Don's Knights is a first-person RPG with grid-based movement and real-time combat. It is set in a fictional medieval kingdom of Don, and the player controls a single male character, a noble knight sent on a secret mission by the king.
At the start of the game, the unnamed protagonist is summoned by King Albert IV. The monarch tells him that the night before, six other knights led by the vile baron Raymond sacked the castle of the king's cousin, Sir Vilfred, and stole the secret plans of the royal castle. These plans are crucial for their revolt as they intend to unseat Albert.
The main character is thus asked by the monarch to infiltrate Raymond's castle and retrieve the plans before they are made use of by the rebels. There are only twelve days to complete this task. He successfully sneaks into the castle hidden in a barrel, and emerges in the cellar with only a dagger as his weapon, and no armour. From there, the player is in complete control of the protagonist's actions.
The game plays largely similar to other grid-based RPGs like Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, but with a somewhat greater emphasis on inventory item manipulation and puzzle-solving. A paper-doll system is used to equip the character. During hand-to-hand combat the game switches to a third-person view, while ranged weapons like crossbows are fired from the first-person perspective. Learning and using magic is also possible at some later point in the game.
The player has five attributes: strength, wisdom, courage, skill and magic. These are predefined and there is no stat rolling or character classes to choose from before the game starts. Additionally there are the hunger and thirst meters, which must be watched and replenished using food and drink found throughout the game.
There are rather many non-hostile NPCs that the player will come across during their journey, but only a few can be talked to; most simply ignore the player but may be attacked.
