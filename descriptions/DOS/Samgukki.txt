Samgukki ("The Record of Three Kingdoms") is a turn-based strategy game reminiscent of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, but set in Korea during the local Three Kingdoms period and following the five-hundred-years struggle for dominance between the kingdoms of Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje that began in 57 A.D.
The game allows the player to control various rulers and warlords of the warring states, managing armies and planning invasions. Scenarios play out on a map of Korea that is divided into provinces. The game has a somewhat simpler gameplay than Koei's series, and focuses more on military strategy and combat.
