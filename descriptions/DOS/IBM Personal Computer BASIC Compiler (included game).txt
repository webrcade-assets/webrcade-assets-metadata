IBM's first BASIC Compiler for its PC (v1.00) comes bundled with a demonstration program, which succinctly goes by the name of Target. As might be inferred, this is a shooting gallery-type game: the player controls a ground-based mobile gun that can move left and right, trying to line up shots and hit the targets that cross the top half of the screen.Only one shell may be fired from each possible location on the floor; once it's gone, you cannot fire from that exact spot again. Your targets come in different sizes: the smaller they are, the faster they fly - and the more points you score if you can hit them. If you've beaten the previous high score when the allotted time runs out, you can proudly enter your name as the top record holder... at least until the end of the session.
