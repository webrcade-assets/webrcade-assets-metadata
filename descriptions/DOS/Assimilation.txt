Assimilation is a shareware variant of the Ataxx board game. The players start with several pieces on an 8x8 square board. In each turn, a player can clone his piece onto an adjacent square (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), or move a piece two squares in a specific direction (knight moves are not allowed in this variant). If a piece is placed on a square adjacent to the opponent's pieces, all of them get converted to the player's color. Certain squares on the board are blocked and are unavailable for either player. The game ends once the players have no more moves, at which point the player with more pieces is the winner.As an unique feature of this variant, two hidden bombs are placed on random squares on the board. A piece which lands on a bomb is destroyed, with the bomb square becoming unavailable.The registered version contains 50 board layouts, three difficulty levels for the computer opponent, the option to play without bombs, a move suggestion feature, and "3 Killers" which according to the text file "destroy you immediately". The unregistered version only contains 10 boards and two difficulty levels.
