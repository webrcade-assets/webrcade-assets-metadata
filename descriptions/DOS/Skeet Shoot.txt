A simple target-shooting game: you're armed with a swiveling gun on the ground, while targets streak across the sky from left to right (the title may lead you to expect "clay pigeons", but they look like actual birds -- at least as far as ASCII would allow).  The gun can be pointed in five different angles, and to get a good shot you'll have to aim carefully and lead the target.  You get exactly one minute to score as many accurate hits as you can.
