Target is a simple game of marksmanship: as a series of hostile starships zoom nonchalantly across the screen, you attempt to get them within your crosshairs, so you can proceed to fry them with your trusty pair of lasers. You'll face off against five such enemies, and each one will take a somewhat different flight path; the four available skill levels determine the speed of the action. When you've had your five attempts, you will be verbally rewarded - or abused - based on your rate of success.
