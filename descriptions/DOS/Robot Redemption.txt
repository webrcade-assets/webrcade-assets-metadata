Robot Redemption is a free, open source first-person shooter game based on the code of id Software's Hovertank 3D, with almost identical gameplay, but different art and story. Here, the player assumes the role of Mash Hardrock, an owner of a Hyperbox Stardrive TM craft (which looks suspiciously like a red version of Doctor Who's TARDIS, and appears to function in a similar manner), who is hired by the Jupiter Moon Mining Corporation to carry out rescue operations in their installations on the moons of Jupiter.
The objective in each mission / level is to warp in using not-TARDIS, then scout the area in the mining moon buggy which has been provided by the corporation, pick up stranded robot workers and get back to the ship to evacuate before the countdown timer reaches zero. Various alien-looking monsters stand in the way, but the buggy is armed with a mining laser and protected with energy shields. An on-board radar displays the location of friendly robots, and a turbo jet may be used to speed up movement.
The basic version Robot Redemption runs under DOS, but it has been ported to Windows and Linux using the Unity implementation of the Hovertank 3D engine. The game has 20 levels. Progress is saved automatically upon completion of a level, and the starting mission may then be selected when beginning a new game.
