Puzzle Storybook is a childrenâ€™s computer game combining interactive puzzles with storybooks. Children solve puzzles with tiles and geometric shapes, then write the stories and hear the words read out loud. Different skill levels can be adjusted to the child to suit his/her needs, and the Helper options allows the parent to customize the activities as well. Children create their own scenes by selecting a scene, then adding characters, buildings, and other objects from the Picture Library. The recommended age group is 3 to 8.
