A sliding puzzle game similar to classic picture puzzle games however instead of completing an image you slide numbered blocks 1 through 16 into order. The game starts with the numbers in a scrambled order, just like in the picture puzzle. There is always one empty square into which you can slide one of the surrounding 4 blocks. The object of the game is to slide all the blocks back into their original numerical order. The problem is that since you have only one empty square to work with when arranging the blocks you inevitably place the puzzle further out of order in your attempts to solve the puzzle.
