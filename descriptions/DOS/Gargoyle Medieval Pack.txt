Gargoyle Medieval Pack is a collection of three arcade games sharing the same theme of elves defending against the onslaught of gargoyles. These games tell the story of how the elves take back their kingdom from the oppressive gargoyles, in chronological order:Gargoyle - similar to Kaboom! The elves must catch fireballs thrown by gargoyles using buckets of water.Gargoyle Revenge - similar to Bouncing Babies. Gargoyles throw elves out of castle windows, and a rescue crew with a trampoline at the bottom must catch the elves and manoeuvre them to the safety of a haystack.Gargoyle Mania - similar to Demon Attack (and generally Space Invaders style games). Waves of gargoyles fly around the screen, and the elves need to shoot them all down with a crossbow.Between waves, the player may purchase weapon upgrades and other equipment (depending on the game being played) with money collected during play.Gargoyle Medieval Pack was originally sold as shareware. The unregistered version included only a limited selection of levels for each game, and some weapons in Gargoyle Mania were unavailable. Author Jeff Souders made the full version freeware on 31 August 2008.
