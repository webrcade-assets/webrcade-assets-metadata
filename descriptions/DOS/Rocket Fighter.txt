Rocket Fighter is a single player keyboard controlled game. It is similar in style to an Asteroids clone but instead of space rocks the player has to contend with enemy space ships which always travel in vertical or horizontal lines.The objective is to fly around the game level, destroying all the enemy ships and then finding the worm hole that will take you to the next level, there are five levels in all and the galaxy won't be safe until they are all cleared
