Long time ago, there was peace between the heavenly and earthly realms. However, a race of vicious monsters emerged, assaulting human settlements. On his eighteenth birthday, a young swordsman named Yang Chengwu discovers that his mother was killed by monsters, entrusting his adoptive family with a powerful sword before passing away. Now, armed with this sword, the young man is determined to avenge the death of his mother and bring peace back to the land.Tian Wai Jian Sheng Lu is a Taiwanese-made fantasy role-playing game set in an unspecified location and time period in old China. The gameplay template is that of Japanese RPGs, with linear advancement, character-focused plot, and simple character growth system. Enemies appear randomly and the battles are turn-based, viewed from a behind-the-back perspective. Two other characters will join Yang Chengwu on his quest, each with different sets of skills and martial arts techniques. There is no world map exploration; traveling on the map involves selecting locations in a linear fashion.
