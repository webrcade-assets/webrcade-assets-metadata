Î¼Labyrinth is a puzzle game, where the player should guide an object across a magnetic field, which cells have different polarity. The magnetic field is auto-generated each time the player starts the level. Taking into account the principle of magnetic fields superposition, the player by turns should assign red (south) or blue (north) polarity to the object to make it move to the next cell in the magnetic field. In case of equilibrium state for the object in the current cell, the player can choose the movement direction on his own. It is restricted to return back to the cell already visited, or to leave the field, otherwise the control over the object will be lost. Points are achieved for timed-based passing the level. Highest points are stored in the top seven table.
