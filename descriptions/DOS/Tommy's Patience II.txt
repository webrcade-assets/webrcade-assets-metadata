Tommy's Patience II is a shareware, single-player card game.
This implementation includes four games:* Betsy Ross, aka Quadruple Alliance

Corner Card, aka Four Seasons
Pyramid
Sir Tommy, aka Old Patience or Try Again

The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has optional basic sound effects, a demo mode, and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
