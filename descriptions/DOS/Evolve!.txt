Evolve! is a life simulation. Populate a world with plants and animals, all with varying stats and behaviors, and see what happens. Behavior depends on the number of nearby friends and foes. The world is simulated with each animal or plant shown as a dot.
Evolve was distributed as Shareware. The unregistered version only had two animal types, and lacked barriers, seasons, graphs and hi-resolution mode, and had lower population limits.
