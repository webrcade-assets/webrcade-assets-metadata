F·R·E·N·Z·Y is a text-mode arcade game. Stranded on an alien planet covered with killer robots, you must run away from them while collecting the fuel pods that they drop. Once enough fuel pods have been collected, a teleport to the next level will open. The game also includes teleporters (will transport you and robots to a random location in the level) and bouncers (will bounce you back if you hit them).F·R·E·N·Z·Y was distributed as twobuckware (if you like it, send the author $2).
