In this updated version of Micro's Dilemma II, the player solves increasingly advanced puzzles in which Micro sets up test fields to fire the laser on circle targets. The player is about to move some objects and turn others, while the rest remain stationary. Music tracks in the game are based on Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker". The registered game comes with 80 levels in total, plus a level editor.
