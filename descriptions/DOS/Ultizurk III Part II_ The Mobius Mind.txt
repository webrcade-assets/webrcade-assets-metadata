Ultizurk III Part II continues where Ultizurk III: The GuildMaster's Quest left off. While the predecessor was distributed as shareware, Part II serves as the second chapter that could be purchased as the registered version. It uses the exact same engine and gameplay as the first part, and has the player control the duo of the Guildmaster and his companion Losi.
