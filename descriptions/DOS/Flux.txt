Flux is a variant of the board game Ataxx. Both players begin with two pieces in opposite corners of the board, and in each turn, a player can clone his piece onto an adjacent square, or move a piece to any place two squares away. If a player's piece is placed on a square adjacent to the opponent's piece, all of them get turned to the player's color. Pieces which are not adjacent to an opponent piece are worth 2 points, all others are worth 1 point. Once the board is full, the winner is the player who has more points.
Four board sizes are available, from 7x7 to 13x13, as well as three difficulty levels.
