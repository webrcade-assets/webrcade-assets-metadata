Ultimate Gin is a single-player, mouse controlled, shareware implementation of the card game Gin Rummy.
In this game there are eight computer players to play against each of which plays differently and to a different standard, though only four are available in the shareware release. The game has detailed guides on how to play and supports Hollywood, Oklahoma (Ace=Gin) and Oklahoma (Ace=One) variations of the game together with a variety of scoring options.
Also available is an add-on voice pack as the basic game is silent.
