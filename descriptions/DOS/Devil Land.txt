As a devil named Little Giovanni you have to beat about 40 levels. In each level there are three hidden golden hairs which have to be found to open the exit to the next stage. You have no weapons but you can kill some enemies by jumping on their heads. Like in Super Mario Bros you get bonus items by bouncing on floating blocks, such as invulnerability or extra lives. None of them are power-ups, this means every enemy contact results in a life loss. In underwater levels you have to swim into oxygen bubbles to avoid drowning.
