The titular Little Willy goes on a rescue mission find his kidnapped sister and mother from the hands of aliens. The gameplay is very similar to Apogee's Crystal Caves including the platforming, the levels accessed from a main hub and a rocket pistol as a choice of weapon. Each level requires the player to find the exit card and any required keys to finish the level, while acquiring juice boxes and lollipops as well as avoiding traps and hazards.
