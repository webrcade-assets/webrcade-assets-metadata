Nakksigwang is a Korean-made fishing game. The player controls an office worker who got tired of everyday routine and decides to go on a little vacation. There are four locations available, all situated on the same lake. Before the actual fishing, the player should choose the types of lines and hooks he or she wishes to use, as well as find suitable bait. It is also possible to fish with a net. The player can switch between day and night time and view statistics regarding the protagonist's fishing experience.
