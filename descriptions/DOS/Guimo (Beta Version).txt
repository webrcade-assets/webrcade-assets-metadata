This is a very early version of Guimo which was released to showcase the game's innovative features, primarily the advanced AI of the monsters. The art is noticeably different from the final release, as is the level layout.
The background story of the game is slightly different from the final version as well. Guimo is said to be a hero from the planet Lazz. Having saved his homeworld from the invading forces of the evil emperor Necterion, he must now rescue the inhabitants of another planet, called Deekore, from the same threat. As in the final version, Guimo can employ the aid of friendly Eggy Robots, but otherwise there is a limited variety powerups and weapons in the beta version.
