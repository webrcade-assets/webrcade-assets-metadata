It spreads disease, it hangs out in your food, it has an annoying buzz.  It's the common housefly, and this game wages total extermination on the nasty little bugger.  One fly after the other comes dancing across your screen.  Pay careful attention to its position: once it stops, you have to choose one of your three swatters to nail it with.  If you succeed, you get a look at the filthy critter's splattered remains... and face off against a faster fly.  If you miss, you'll have to deal with a slower one again.  The more you whack, the quicker they get - if you manage to nail the fastest of them all, victory is yours!
