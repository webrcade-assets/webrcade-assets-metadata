Der Ring des Nibelungen is an English-language text adventure inspired by the 19th-century epic opera of the same name. The frame narrative explained in the introduction is that you are a modern-day person who has fallen asleep at the opera. The game itself is set within that person's dreams, which combine elements of Wagner's opera work with references to contemporary opera appreciation culture.
