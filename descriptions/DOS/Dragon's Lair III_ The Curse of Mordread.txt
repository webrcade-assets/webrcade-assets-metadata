This game features a set of levels from the arcade version of Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp not used (unable to fit, presumably!) in Readysoft's earlier home conversion. It has Dirk dodging QTEs through various time periods and dimensions to such memorable locales as Wonderland, a pirate ship, and even the keyboard of Ludwig von Beethoven!
