Space Invaders is a single player, freeware clone of Taito's Space Invaders. The objective of the game is to achieve a high score. The player has control of a canon at the bottom of the screen and must successive destroy waves of advancing alien ships. There are three lives in this game, so if a canon is destroyed there are two replacements available. Additional canons are awarded every 10,000 points. If an alien lands or if a canon is destroyed the player must restart the current level again. As each successive screen is cleared the next screen starts with the alien ships positioned lower down the screen. The game is over when all canon have been destroyed. The game is played via the keyboard. It does not record the scores the player(s) achieved.
