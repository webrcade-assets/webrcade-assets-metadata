Star Trek: The Last Generation is an unlicensed Star Trek game distributed as freeware. You have just been promoted to captain and given command of the starship Enterprise. Your goal is to reach the wreck of the starship Saggitarius which contains several safes filled with valuable dilithium crystals. These crystals are an important source of energy, and without them the Federation fleet won't have enough fuel to defend against the Romulans who intend to annex some planets in the Federation's border region. To make things worse, the Romulans know about the wreck and its contents, so the Enterprise has to be quick and reach the Saggitarius before the Romulans do.The game plays like an adventure game that involves a lot of "guess the right move" situations. The player will often find himself faced with a situation where the wrong action leads to the Enterprise's destruction, which restarts the game from the beginning. In the intro, the game explicitly tells the player to note down various details such as coordinates, safe codes, and stardates, because they are required to be typed in exactly later in the game. It relies heavily on trial and error as well as meticulous recordkeeping.
