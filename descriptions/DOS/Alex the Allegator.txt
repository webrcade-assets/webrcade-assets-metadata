Alex the Allegator is an unfinished platformer created during a game jam. In this game, players assume control of Alex, an alligator on a quest to find his missing girlfriend. Although enemies and obstacles have not been fully implemented, the game is functional. Players guide Alex through the level, helping him reach the goal by exploring and occasionally jumping between platforms. Additionally, the game features cooperative multiplayer, although there is no split-screen functionality, and the camera remains focused on the first player.
