Wall Street Wizard is a German stock market simulation. Up to six human players compete against each other or against computer-controller opponents; the game supports local multiplayer via hotseat as well as multiplayer via null-modem cable and modem. One of the special features of Wall Street Wizard is that modem mode allegedly works cross-platform, i.e the Amiga version of the game can connect to either the ST version or the DOS version, and vice versa.
Players get to define a persona by distributing points in four categories (appearance, money, health and luck), thus slightly altering play strategies. The bulk of the game is spent on the trade floor buying and selling shares of fictional companies while the clock ticks (about 12 real-time minutes per round per player!). Wall Street Wizard tries to simulate the buzz and shouted offers of a real trade floor. Once trading had ended, each player gets to invest in strategic activities such as gathering intelligence via newspapers and economic forecasts, investigating or sabotaging other players and improving one's health or appearance.
The game ends once the first player has reached the freely selectable goal, e.g. accumulated a certain amount of wealth.
The game was originally released in late 1988 for Amiga and Atari ST and ported to the PC in 1989. Also available was a separately sold editor that allowed users to alter several of the simulation's parameters as well as edit companies and their interdependencies. This editor came with a '89 scenario (the game's original scenario is set in 1988).
