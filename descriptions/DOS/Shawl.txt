Shawl is a logical arcade game dealing with card suits. Circles of different colors, radii, and card suits appear in the rectangular frame, where the quasi-stick is flying in diagonal directions, ricocheting from the frame borders. The goal is to collect only unique suits to compose a four-suit set. Collecting a suit that already exists in the set composed so far will eliminate all other suits collected in the series up until this suit. Too many such missteps will lead to game over.
