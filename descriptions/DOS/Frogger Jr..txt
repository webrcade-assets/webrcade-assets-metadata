An unofficial port of the commercial game Hopper, which existed on other home computer platforms, itself a clone of the popular arcade hit Frogger. Lead your frog safely across a crowded city street with five lanes of traffic, avoiding the cars that come whizzing by - then help it cross the river, hopping onto logs and floating leaves to reach its home at the top.To tweak the difficulty, you may adjust the speed setting and select one of four skill levels. Higher levels feature busier traffic and a more treacherous river, but compensate by boosting your score.
