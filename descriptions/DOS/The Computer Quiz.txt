This multiple-choice quiz game, published as part of Big Blue Disk #21, asks one hundred questions about computer hardware and software.  Interestingly, the player is given three "men," and loses a man every time a question is answered incorrectly.  Bonus men can be earned by answering ten questions correctly.  At the end of play, men are cashed in for points, meaning that the best possible score is 113.  Obviously, this is a bit dated, but it's a fun snapshot of the computer world of the late eighties.
