Lunar Lander is a single player game based on one of the truly classic games. In this implementation the keyboard controls the craft's attitude and the mouse controls the thrust
The objective in this game is to land a craft on each of the planet's bases to refuel and to score points. Very good landings earn the player diamonds, these can be converted into fuel allowing the player to progress further in the game. When all landings have been made the player advances to the next planet and so on. The registered game also has a 'Combat Mode' in which each base has a radar dish, gas tank, and a gun emplacement. The player must eliminate the radar bases before they can land. The radar bases control gunnery emplacements which must be destroy, or alternately damaged, in order to recover weaponry from them.
This game bears a striking similarity to Gravity Well from PLBM Games and is probably an earlier version of that game.
