Long ago, back in the days of cavemen and dinosaurs, there was a land called Og.  In this land, hungry one-eyed cavemen, called Trogs, loved the taste of eggs.  However, four Dino-Mites, Spike, Bloop, Rex and Gwen, were determined to rescue the eggs from certain doom!
Up to four (or just Spike and Bloop in the home conversions) can play in a race to gather up the Trog eggs as quickly as possible.  The first player to get all eggs of their colour wins the round.  Of course, Trogs also love the taste of Dino meat, and will use cavemen inventions such as fire and the wheel to catch them and gobble them up!  Luckily, the Dinos can fight back - eating a pineapple will turn them into a monstrous T-Rex that can chow down on Trogs, while a hot tamale lets them breathe fire.
