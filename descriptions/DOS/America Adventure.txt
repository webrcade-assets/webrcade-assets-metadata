America Adventure is an educational application designed to explore the history and geography of the United States of America. The primary focus is on the so-called American Tour, spanning from 40,000 B.C. to 1993. Users can navigate a timeline, with each entry providing information about specific topics such as Native Americans or the Industrial Revolution. Additionally, the app features two animations: one where portraits of American presidents morph into each other, and another displaying a timeline of state populations. A few video clips are also included.The game content consists of three quizzes, each rewarding one point for a correct answer. Players can answer as many times as needed without any penalties:State Identification : Players are given the name of a state and must click on it within a map.Capital Identification : Players receive the name of a capital city and must correctly identify the corresponding state on the map (states are marked with their abbreviations).Landmark Recognition : Players view a photo of a landmark (e.g., the Golden Gate Bridge) and must choose the correct state from three options.
