Another DG Game: I Want My C64 Back is a short adventure game made with the SCI engine. In this game, the protagonist, DG, still uses a C64 but decides to swap it for a modern PC. Very unsatisfied with the experience, DG rushes to the recycling center to retrieve his beloved C64. The player directly controls DG using the arrow keys and enters commands in the parser to trigger actions (such as picking up an item). The game consists of six screens, one mandatory puzzle, and one optional puzzle.
