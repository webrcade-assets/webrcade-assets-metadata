Jageun Manyeo ("Little Witch") is a hybrid of a platformer and a role-playing game. The titular character is a little girl who lives with her mother in a quiet town, but ventures into dangerous realms on her quest to become a full-fledged sorceress. Visually and gameplay-wise the game resembles Popful Mail; however, the RPG element is more pronounced and includes experience points awarded for defeating enemies, which results in character growth.
The heroine can only fight enemies with various magic spells, which deplete her MP bar. Besides experience, enemies also award her with gold, which can be used in towns to purchase restorative and supporting items. Towns (and sometimes also hostile areas) contain friendly non-player characters that the little witch can talk to. Rather than having a continuous world, the game is divided into areas, which can be accessed from a world map and tackled in a linear fashion. Hostile areas consist of platform systems and tend to be fairly maze-like. Game progress can be saved at any time.
