Koach Tzabar is a promotional game distributed along with the Israeli Tzabar Salads. The gameplay is similar to Xonix. The player needs to reveal 9 lids of Tzabar Salads by "occupation areas", and be careful from the enemies. A life is lost when there is contact with an enemy. The player needs to "occupy" the percentage that appears on the right side in order to go to the next level. The game contains three levels of difficulty. In the easy difficulty the game does not have a time limit, unlike the advanced and professional difficulty levels. In the latter two if the player does not occupy the required percentage in time, a life is lost. The game also contains bonuses that help the player (move faster, the little enemies will explode, pause all the enemies for 5 seconds and more).
