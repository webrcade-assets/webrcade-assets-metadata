Troy is a fixed screen arcade platform game featuring a cartoonish dinosaur (presumably the eponymous "Troy", although it is never clearly stated in the game) who, for some reason, collects gold nuggets in dungeons populated by various monsters and other hazards.
The dinosaur, who hatches from an egg at the start of every level, can jump and shoot an energy beam with unlimited ammo, but many enemies are able to shoot back. Moreover, some are completely impervious to the player's attacks and must be simply avoided (and their projectiles dodged) while moving around the levels. There is no time limit, player lives or score points, and each level is completed by collecting all gold nuggets.
Troy was released as freeware. There are 30 levels in the game, each taking a single screen. There are no sound effects or music and no save or load game options.
