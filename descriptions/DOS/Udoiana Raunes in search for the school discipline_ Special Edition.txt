Udoiana Raunes is a point-and-click adventure game that parodies the Indiana Jones adventures by LucasArts. The story is set in Germany in 1999 (one year into the future as the game was released in 1998), and the main character is Udo Rau a.k.a. Udoiana Raunes, an eccentric teacher who dresses like Indiana Jones and carries a whip. Pupils from his school rebel against bureaucracy and bad grades, and take over in a violent uprising. As teachers are apprehended and purges begin, the students disagree over the future course of their revolution and split into two parties: the bullies and the nerds.Caught amidst this crisis, Udoiana Raunes simply wants to go home, but is unexpectedly visited by the ghost of Wilhelm von Humboldt himself, who tasks Udo with finding the three holy stones which will restore the educational system to its pristine form, untainted by red tape and favouritism. Raunes sets off on this quest, visiting several exotic locations along the way.In spite of being a parody/spoof, Udoiana Raunes is a fully-featured game that plays like one would expect: the player can talk to characters with multiple dialogue options, pixel-hunt for useful items and solve puzzles to progress further. The game was released as freeware and is available in both German, the original language, and an English translation.
