Dinosaur Discovery Kit is an educational game with a dinosaur theme that is aimed at preschoolers and young elementary school children. The game is presented by a character named Zug the Mega-saurus, a friendly green dinosaur who wears various costumes throughout the game. There are three education modules included, consisting of a coloring book where you can color dinosaurs, a story maker where you can make a story about Zug or other dinosaurs, and a card matching game where the player can play alone, with a friend, or against Zug, with a choice between matching cards with Zug on them, or various species of dinosaurs. The game also comes with a text-to-speech feature that makes navigating the game even easier for young children.
