In what must be the second-worst job in the Space Corps (just before fertilizing the meat vats), the player controls a little astronaut who's been put on extra-vehicular garbage duty.  Since orbital velocity 300 km up is ten times that of a bullet planetside, intercepting even a small piece of debris is a risky proposition.  Worse, the spaceman is only after one variety of garbage at a time -- all others will hurt and push the player around.
Once the player has snatched enough of the right kind of jetsam, the level is complete and they advance to the next -- much the same, only needing to collect a higher number of a different variety of space trash.
