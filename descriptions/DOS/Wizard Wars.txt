Temeres the Wizard is entrusted with the quest to reunite the White Unicorn with the Black Unicorn, and restore the cosmic balance by ultimately defeating the evil wizard Aldorin in a magical combat. He must search the three dimensions for magical items and potions to help him on his quest. This won't be easy to accomplish, since each area is guarded by mystical creatures who don't take likely to intruders.
Wizard Wars is a turn-based role-playing game in which Temeres battles creatures using magical spells. In the beginning elemental spells such as Lightning Bolt are used for the most part; later on the player will be able to create new spells. During combat the player takes turns with the enemy, choosing a single action (cast spells, use potions, flee, etc.) Afterwards the player can mix potions, create spells, view character information, or continue traveling the lands.
