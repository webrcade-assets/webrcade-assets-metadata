In Losing Your Grip, the protagonist, Terry, is in rehab for nicotine addiction. When the game begins, Terry is standing in a muddy glade as the rain pours down. Soon, a human head, buried up in the mud, explains, mysteriously, that Terry has "pieces to recover", and he is left to his own devices.Losing Your Grip is an interactive fiction game. Commands, like go north, are entered into a text parser, and the game responds with text as well.
