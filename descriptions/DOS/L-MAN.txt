Three million years ago, five powerful animal-like races from another galaxy (Bats, Leopards, Tigers, Frogs, and Lizards) migrated to Earth. The Bats wanted to dominate the other races, which ended in a war between them. Eventually, most of them died out. The remaining ones retained their super-powers, but blended in with the human civilization and continued living on the Earth as normal human beings.Xiao Jianren is a self-described "normal guy": a raunchy teenager with an inclination to women's underwear fetish. However, he is also the last remaining member of the Lizard race. His teacher Xuer, the sister of the powerful Batwoman, warns him that Degula of the Bat people wants to revive the struggle of the past by attempting to take over the Earth, more specifically its female population. Naturally, it's up to the unlikely hero to recall the ways of his ancestors and prevent that from happening.L-MAN is a humorous Taiwanese-made game with cartoon-like visuals. Though it has the structure of a fighting game, the actual gameplay consists of simple turn-based combat with a real-time element, during which the player selects icons that represent various offensive and defensive moves at the right moment, and then watches animated attacks unfold. There is no other gameplay besides these battles, and no RPG-like elements. Cutscenes occupy a considerable portion of the story mode, and the battles are dictated by the plot. In the versus mode, one or two players can select various characters from the story and go straight into the battle.
