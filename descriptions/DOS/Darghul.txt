Darghul is a German shareware RPG comparable to Ultima VI. You are trying to shed light on the murder of your parents and the changes in the behaviour of the king.To reach this goal you explore several cities in a isometric perspective. To speak with the residents you have to type keywords like in the Ultima games.The combat is turn-based. A speciality is that the handling of weapons and armor plays an important part. With an inexperienced character it is often more effective to use a worse but easier to handle weapon.The shareware version allows you to play approximately half of the game. When you pay the registration fee you get access to the whole game.
