Bap is a freeware Breakout -style game. The player moves a paddle across the bottom of the screen. This deflects a moving ball which strikes, and destroys, blocks in the upper part of the screen. There are thirty levels in all and there is no scoring system. The objective is to complete all the levels. At every third level a password is provided so that the player can resume playing a that level. The paddle can be controlled either by a keyboard or by a mouse. Sound is optional and where present consists of a squeak when the ball makes contact with the paddle or a brick and a very short tune at the start and end of the game.
