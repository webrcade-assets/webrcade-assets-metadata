Magics I is a collection of three arcade style games:

Magics-Cobra - a Snake variant
Magics-Dia - a Columns variant
Magics-Ball - an arcade/puzzle game that combines elements from both Snake and Columns

Magics I was sold as shareware, with the unregistered version only allowing to play the first few levels from each of the above games. Registered users would also receive level editors for Magics-Ball and Magics-Cobra.
