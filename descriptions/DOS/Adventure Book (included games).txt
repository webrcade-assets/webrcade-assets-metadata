Adventure Book is a suite of applications put together to allow a would-be programmer to compile simple Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style games. One of these included is Gnomic, a complete demonstration game only ever distributed with Adventure Book, a quick example of the hyperfiction engine's potential uses and properties.
No computer conversion of the devious party game, this is a multiple-choice text adventure game whose name applies doubly: not only does Gnomic pertain to the pursuit of knowledge (as with gnostic) but in this case to a very particular kind of knowledge: the location of a garden gnome in the rubble of an overgrown backyard. Choices are made by selecting the letter of the most fitting option; the use of inventory items is invoked by typing in the name of the object.
Also bundled is Aliens!, a demo game inviting a player to decrypt an extraterrestrial code and escape from a UFO holding cell.
