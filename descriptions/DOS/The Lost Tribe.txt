In The Lost Tribe you get to go back in time and lead a prehistoric tribe to a new homeland. When the volcano that your tribe has always called "home" explodes and molten lava engulfs your village at its base, you have little choice but to assume command of your frightened tribe and seek out a different place to live. This means providing for your tribe's food, shelter, safety, and general happiness all along the way.
Six different scenarios provide a variety of challenges for players of various skill levels. The game's educational side is present in teaching the player about prehistoric cultures, artifacts, and mythology.
