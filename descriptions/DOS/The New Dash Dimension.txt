You are up to the challenge of collecting precious diamonds. These are found in underground caves you have to dig into. In each cave you have to collect all, or at least a given amount of diamonds and reach the exit before the timer runs out. Sometimes there are less diamonds present than it would be needed, but there are ways to generate some. Boulders block your path and can crush you if they fall on your head, but they can be pushed away, and even used to your advantage in some situations. Other lifeforms are to be found in the caves, that are fatal to closely encounter with.
This game is a close clone of Boulder Dash with 16 color VGA graphics and the possibility of adding new levels. Formerly shareware, version 2.31 is now available to download freely, together with the level editor.
