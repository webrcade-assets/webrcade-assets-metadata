Whatever We Decide to Call this Game is a text adventure game where you play the role of a freshman arriving at Tumbulgum University, on your first day. As the introduction explains, there are three seemingly-simple tasks you must complete by the end of your first day: enroll yourself in classes, get a parking sticker, and find a bathroom. You begin outside the imposing entrance of the university's administration building, but to succeed in your quest you will need to find and explore various other buildings across the campus.
