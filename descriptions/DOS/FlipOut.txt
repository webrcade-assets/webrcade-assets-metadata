FlipOut is a Breakout variant that attempts to bring in certain features from pinball. The basic ball-bouncing mechanics with the horizontal paddle controlled by the player are the same as in Breakout, but instead of the usual rectangular blocks to be destroyed, there are objects of varying shapes called GeoMex that are arranged in intricate patterns on the playing field, interspersed with indestructible "walls" at different angles. The objective of each level is to clear it from all GeoMex, which will open the ceiling and thus the way for the ball to the next level that is literally above the previous one.Conversely, if the ball falls trough the bottom of the screen, it is taken back to the lower/previous level, from which it will need to go up again. For this reason, the game starts on the third level, with the possibility of falling back down to the previous two. Because of this mechanic, there are no lives or tries in this game. Unlike Breakout, the bottom of the screen in every level is initially completely blocked off by destructible surfaces, which should prevent the ball from falling down too early. There are no bonuses that fall out of destroyed blocks.FlipOut is sold as shareware, with the unregistered version allowing to play four levels out of fifteen in the full game.
