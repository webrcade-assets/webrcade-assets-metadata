Alien Poker is a simulation of 5-card draw poker for one player. The other players are, as you might expect from the title, aliens. Each alien has a different appearance and poker strategy. Up to five aliens can be added to the table. Unlike other poker games, here the explicit goal is to clean out the other players; each player drops out as they run out of money, and the game ends when only the specified number of players remain. The player wins if they have the highest cash total when that happens.Alien Poker was distributed as Shareware. The registered version includes more aliens to choose from.
