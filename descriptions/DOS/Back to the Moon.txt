Back to the Moon is a freeware Lunar Lander variant. The player must rescue teams from various mining planets in the solar system. The gameplay is straightforward: the mother ship releases the rocket at the top of the screen, and the player must land on one of the safe platforms. If a miner is nearby, he enters the player’s rocket, and the player flies back to the mother ship. This process is repeated until all miners on the planet are saved. The challenge lies in controlling the rocket’s speed: landing or docking too quickly causes the rocket to bounce back and become damaged. Additionally, there are other obstacles flying around the screen that must be avoided.Fortunately, some obstacles can be shot down, but the gun only works when a miner is on board. A life is lost if the rocket becomes too damaged or runs out of fuel. There are five power-ups that can be collected either in the air or by landing on a platform: extra fuel, energy refuel, super fire, supernova bomb, and an extra life. The game can be saved at any time.
