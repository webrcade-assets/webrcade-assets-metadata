Rite of the Druid is a graphical text adventure whereby your character wishes to become a druid and must search for a rune of power to complete the ritual. It uses the standard N, S, E, and W for navigation, X to examine and I for inventory.  It uses a standard verb-noun parser - LOOK, USE (item), GET (item), etc. It is a short game running at only 25 screens, where you will solve puzzles in various locations including woodlands, shores, volcano edges and mountain bases.
