Tetrolis is a Tetris clone for up to two players. The game is played with blocks. There are 7 different types of blocks that you will encounter, and each has a different shape. The idea of the game is to fill a line of the pit, so that there will be no blocks left. Then the line disappears, and the rest of the blocks fall down by a line. Once the top of the pit is reached, the game is over. The game allows to play in three play modes.
