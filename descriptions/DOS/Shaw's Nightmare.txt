Shaw's Nightmare is a freeware indie first-person shooter inspired by the classic titles of the genre, most notably DOOM. The game uses Ken Silverman 's Build engine.
Shaw is a little boy who fell asleep while reading a book and is now trapped in a bizarre world of nightmares. He will have to escape dangerous traps and face various unfriendly creatures on his way to freedom. Finding weapons and other useful items which are scattered across the world will greatly help Shaw in his quest.
The game consists of four episodes, each nine levels long. There is no multiplayer support.
