Dark Ages: Volume 2 - The Undead Kingdom is the second part of the Dark Ages shareware trilogy. In this episode, the prince visits the underworld of the Great Kingdom in his search for the evil Garth.
Released alongside with the first episode, there are no changes to the gameplay: this is a side-scrolling platformer in which the hero moves from left and right and jumps over holes in the ground. It is advised to either dodge or kill enemies with the ranges attack because touching them removes health. To progress, the player needs to find items and give them to wise men which in turn show the exit to the next level.
