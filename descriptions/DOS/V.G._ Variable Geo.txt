Variable Geo, the first in the row of all-female fighting games, has a very simple story: in order to attract more customers, a restaurant organized a fighting tournament in which its waitresses take part. The player chooses one of the six available waitresses and has to defeat the other five to win the big prize.There are no cut-scenes or story development in the game beside very short conversation snippets when characters finish the battle or during an adult scene. The player character has to win two battles out of three in order to advance to the next stage. Each successful round leads to an erotic scene: a mild one after the first round, a more hardcore one after the whole battle is won. The defeated girls are stripped down and sometimes humiliated in a sexual way. Each girl has standard moves (punch, kick, and their combinations while jumping or crouching), as well as character-specific techniques such as a long-range attack, throwing the opponents into air, choking the opponents, etc.
