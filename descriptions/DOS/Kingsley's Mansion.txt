Kingsley's Mansion is a text adventure game. In 1934, a mansion burned down, killing the residents inside: Dr. Benjamin Kingsley, his daughter Alexandria, and their maid Rosa. Satan has kept their ghosts trapped in the mansion ever since. Once a year, the mansion reappears, and the ghosts are forced to relive that deadly day. Many years later, you are on a rock-hunting expedition, when the mansion appears right in front of you. Obviously, you enter to investigate.
