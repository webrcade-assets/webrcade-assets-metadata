In the year 2044 AD, world governments have fallen apart and the Earth is ruled by ruthless corporations doing anything for profit. However, rebels are fighting against corporate control all over the planet. The protagonist of the game saves the life of a stranger, sacrificing his own life in the process. Taking the protagonist to his lab, the stranger performs a secret experiment on him, and is able to bring him back to life. The hero awakens with a strange crystal embedded in his forehead, giving him control over a mysterious power known as the Darklight. The lab is attacked by the forces of NeCrom, who also controls the Darklight. The protagonist must escape from the lab, learn about the Darklight and the aliens bringing it to the planet, and finally confront NeCrom, his evil counterpart.CyberMage is a 3D first-person shooter set in a dark futuristic environment. Controls can be customized to allow mouse- or keyboard-based gameplay. Jumping, looking up and down (keyboard only), and rudimentary interaction with objects (e.g. switches) are available. The hero is able to use various weapons as well as his Darklight powers against many foes. These offensive, ranged powers deplete a special energy called "Mann-Ra", which regenerates itself over time.The souls of organic enemies are released when they are killed. Approaching these souls before they disappear, the player obtains various power-ups to health and Mann-Ra, which may be temporary (restoring) or permanent (increasing their maximum count). Armor and other items can be found as well. In addition to walking around the cities and war zones, the player can use vehicles like tanks and air cars in some of the levels. Most areas also contain friendly characters who might give the player information. Money can be found scattered throughout the levels, and spent on weapons in the gun shop.
