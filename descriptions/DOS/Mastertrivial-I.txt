Mastertrivial - I is a Spanish quiz game. Up to four players take turns answering questions from different areas of knowledge (history, music, geography, literature etc.) by choosing the correct one out of the four possible solutions. A player is shown as a small human person 'performing' on a stage in front of static audience. The length of the game can be determined based on the number of questions and the amount of time allowed for answering.
