A variation of ball-and-paddle game (inspired by Breakout) by Richard Wong. There are two rows of bricks, one at the top, one at the bottom. Bottom row belongs to Player 1, top to Player 2 or computer. There are 1 to 15 bouncing balls on the field. When a ball comes into contact with the bricks, it shatters them. Each player has a paddle to deflect the balls and protect his bricks. If a ball breaches the wall of breaks, player loses the game.
