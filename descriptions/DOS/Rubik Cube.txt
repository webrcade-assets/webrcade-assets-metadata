Rubik Cube is a shareware single player puzzle game.
The game is entirely keyboard-controlled. There are two modes of play, the player can start with a solved cube and use keyboard commands to randomise it so that it can later be solved. Alternatively the computer can randomise the cube for the player to solve, when this option is chosen the player can specify the number of steps the game can use to mess-up the cube.
The game has a save/load function and a reset function, there's no in-game hint function.
