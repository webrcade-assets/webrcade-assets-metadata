Mensa Master is a 2-player or 1-player versus the computer text-based strategy card game for multiple systems.
The player and their opponent are each given a suit of cards from ace to king, with ace being lowest, and king being the highest. A third suit is randomized, and one card is overturned each round. Each chooses a card from their hand of 13, and the highest card wins the card from the third suit. If both players play the same card, then the card from the third suit is discarded. At the end of 13 rounds, the total number of cards gathered from the third suit are totaled, with higher value cards being worth more points. Ultimately, the player with the highest point value in their hand at the end of the game wins.
There are two difficulty levels. At the lower level, the computer plays the first several cards at random. At the higher levels, the computer plays a perfect game.
