Dylan Dog: Ritorno al Crepuscolo is the second entry in the series of short adventures published monthly by Simulmondo for MS DOS and Amiga computers.
It continues the plot started in the first game of the series, La Regina delle Tenebre : Dylan Dog, the "nightmare investigator", has found his way to the castle of the vampire queen Maledetta, the titular Queen of Darkness. Now he finds himself in the Twilight Zone, the Limbo of the Hell itself, and is told by Maledetta that she called for him not only out of lust, but also because he is the only man able to save both his earthly world and the Hell from some cataclysmic danger. To save them Dylan must find Nessuno (Nobody), another character from original comic books.
Technically and gameplay-wise Ritorno al Crepuscolo is totally the same as the previous game (after all, it was built on the same engine and released month after the first game). All the monsters (all three kinds of them) are the same, and Dylan as always jumps over fire pits, scales stairs and kills enemies with his fists or his gun that one-shots any monster but has limited ammo. NPC dialogs, on the other hand, are all new - and wrong choices of phrase once again lead Dylan to instant death (tip: being polite never hurts. Almost).
