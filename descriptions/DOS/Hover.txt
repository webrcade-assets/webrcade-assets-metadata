Hover is a futuristic Tennis-like game for two players. Each controls a racket-wielding character on one side of the court, and gains points by sending the ball flying past the other player and into the opposing wall. Ball movement is determined by the physics of gravity and momentum; both players are also equipped with a jetpack, which can be activated for some Y-axis action. Hitting one of the two boxes in the corners will reset the turn, and being hit by the ball without swinging the racket will eliminate the player, scoring 5 whole points for the opponent. Each team has a limited number of men, and total game time is adjustable (from 50 to 200 seconds).
