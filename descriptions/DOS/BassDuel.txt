Bass Duel is, as the name implies, a fishing game for one to two players. It is by Richard Olsen and is effectively a two player version of his earlier game Bass Class, lakes created for this game and for BassTour can be used in this game. In all BassDuel will support up to fifty different lakes.
BassDuel is a two player fishing game which can be played as a single player game, it has three levels of difficulty Novice, Intermediate, and Pro together with a practice mode. In a game the object is to catch as many fish as possible with the greatest weight winning the match. Players fish for six hours of game-time per day in three day tournaments. All catches must be weighed in before the end of the day, failure to weigh in means no credit for all that work. In addition the players must manage their fuel and battery power to ensure they are not left stranded on the lake, and select the appropriate rod and lures for the environment.
The game rewards big catches, is a player lands a fish that's bigger than the current record there's a short ceremony and the player is recorded as being a record holder. The game also keeps records of the biggest stringers, i.e. the combined weight of all fish caught and records record holders for these too.
To aid the fisherman/woman they are given a boat which is equipped with a motor, fixed amount of fuel, chart recorder, rod & tackle boxes etc. The player can fish in six different lakes in the basic version of the game and the computer places the fish in realistic locations depending on the lake's topography. The game also features a quoted thirty "of the top names in bass tournament fishing" as opponents.
