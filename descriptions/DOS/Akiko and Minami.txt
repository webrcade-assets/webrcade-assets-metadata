Akiko and Minami is an unofficial remake of The Great Giana Sisters for one or two players, created with Hammer Technologies ' DIV Games Studio programming environment. Unlike other remakes of Giana Sisters, this one uses its own art assets that are completely different from the original Giana graphics, but faithfully recreates the layout of the first four levels and accurately implements all game mechanics, including powerups and breakable tiles with bonus diamonds.Akiko and Minami was released as freeware.
