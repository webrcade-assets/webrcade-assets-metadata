Cell Block A is a two-player death match game set in a prison, there are several levels to pick from. As time goes on, the guards get bored and will throw down lead pipes, fire extinguishers and later if the players are lucky: a shotgun. Players can also kill each other by falling on each other's head or pushing the other onto the jagged iron beams on the bottom of the level. Game was bundled with its own level editor called Jailed.
