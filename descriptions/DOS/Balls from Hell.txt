Balls from Hell is a 1st-person pinball game where the player controls the ball. Similar to traditional pinball games, the objective is to hit table elements to score points and avoid falling into the chute. However, there are notable differences: there are no paddles, and the player can use a gun to shoot robots for extra points. Additional momentum can be gained by pressing the spacebar. Besides the standard pinball mode, there are two additional variants: action mode (which includes speed control with the cursor keys and no bumpers) and supersonic mode (which also features speed control and an automatically panning view).
