A simple maze navigation game with randomly-generated screens in 10 skill levels - 32,000 mazes are possible for each level. The player starts at the middle of the left-side wall, and must find a path towards the right side of the screen while racing against the clock; helpfully, a trail of dots is left behind the player's marker.Being not much more than a programming exercise, the game uses a rather crude algorithm to generate the mazes, so the lower difficulties will have multiple solutions, while the higher ones may have none at all.  For such a contingency, the space bar will generate a new maze, though (somewhat unfairly) the clock keeps ticking while this happens.  The game was published as a type-in title in PC Magazine, along with a write-up that states: "this program will probably not become a cherished family favorite".
