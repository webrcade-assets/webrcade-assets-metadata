Fostiator is one of several sample games that demonstrate the capabilities of DIV Games Studio development environment. It is a simple versus fighting game with four characters and three stages, using high-resolution pre-rendered sprites for characters and scenery objects. It is possible to play against the AI with three difficulty levels, against another player on a single keyboard, or watch two AI opponents fight each other.
There is no plot but the DIV Games Studio user manual gives short (and rather silly) descriptions of each character: Alien, an animated skeleton of an extraterrestrial warrior with sharp claws; Bishop, a bionic fighter; Ripley, the Earth's best gymnast; and Nostromo, an immortal warrior armed with an axe. The character's names are obvious references to the 1979 film Alien and its sequel Aliens, but the game has otherwise no relation to this franchise.
Fostiator was available as a free download from the official DIV Games Studio website. The entire source code of the game was also included with a copy of the DIV Games Studio suite.
