Tommy's Packrat is a single-player DOS Pac-Man clone. The player has to navigate the Packrat character around a maze. The game is entirely keyboard controlled, navigation is via the numeric keypad and game settings are via function keys. Scattered around the maze are seeds which the Packrat eats by running over them. Points are scored for each seed eaten. Some seeds flash. In the maze are bad guys who track down the Packrat because they want to eat it. After eating a flashing seed the Packrat, for a short time, becomes powerful enough to eat the bad guys. Eating bad guys and flashing seeds scores bonus points. The game has nine levels of difficulty and it maintains a record of the opt high scores for each difficulty level.
