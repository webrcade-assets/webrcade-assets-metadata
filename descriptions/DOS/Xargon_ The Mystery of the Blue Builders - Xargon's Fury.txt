Xargon's Fury is the third episode of three that make up the side-scrolling platformer Xargon. This first episode was freely distributed as shareware with the option to register the other two, but they were also sold separately. The company B&N also released each episode separately and commercially under their Monkey Business label. The B&N version can be run directly from the floppy disk by just typing GO.
