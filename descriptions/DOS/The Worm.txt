In yet another take on the classic Snake concept, The Worm lets the player commandeer a smiley-faced crawler whose tail grows along with its appetite. The worm twists about the playfield in search of food, which comes in the form of numbers: when eaten, they increase your score (and your length) correspondingly. Occasionally a spider appears - a moving target worth 10 points, if you manage to chase it down.
Colliding with an obstacle or with your own body counts as a "crash", and 10 of these will end the game. However, the worm can travel diagonally too, which makes it possible to "pass through" your own body if you're careful enough. Another twist is the time factor: the game gradually speeds up until you devour a target (and slows back down when you do).
