Laybrynth of Zeux is a shareware platformer where you have to hunt keys and avoid enemies to reach the exit on each level. The story is very simple: the player assumes the role of renowned theologian Vince M. Louis, who has studied every single religious item in existence... except for one, the Staff of Zeux. This mystical artifact is located in the Labrynth of Zeux, so Vince heads there to get his hands on the item and study it.The graphics are very simple, but the gameplay can be pretty challenging in some levels. The player moves with the arrow keys, jumps with the space key, and can drop bombs with the DEL key. The escape key suicides the character in case the player got himself stuck, but this option should be used sparingly as the game has a limited amount of lives (which can be stocked up by finding an extra life item). Despite the arcade style life system, the game allows saving and loading at any point, allowing players to savescum if they want to.The game features 50 levels to play through.
