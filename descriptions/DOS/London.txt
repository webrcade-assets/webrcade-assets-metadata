London is a single player text adventure with graphics. The game was developed "by and for" Swedish students to help with their English studies.The screen is divided horizontally into two areas. The lower part is where the player enters their commands and views the response while the upper part shows;* On the left the current location and where the exits areIn the centre indicators for the game-time, current cash, and the character's energy level - the player's character is required to eat and sleep during this gameOn the right a small picture of the locationDirection commands can be abbreviated so the player can type simply N instead of NORTH and so on. The Return key repeats the last command so, for example, when riding on the London Underground the player enters the train and types 'WAIT' and after that they just press the Return key until they arrive at their stop.The game is played using only these commands GO, ENTER, LEAVE, WAIT, READ, SAY TO, SLEEP, SAVE, LOAD, and QUIT which are tied to the function keys with F1 triggering GO and F10 QUITting the gameUnusually the game does NOT tell the player what their objective is. There is an in-game assistant known as 'The Adventure Expert' who may help but will require payment. The player starts out outside their Bayswater hotel with no cash at all. After a little investigating the player's objective appears to be to meet someone called 'Limit' who is in London for five days and who has no fixed address but who will be visiting London's famous places ... but 'Why?" and is there more to it?
