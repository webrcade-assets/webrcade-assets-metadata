Permanent Daylight is a humorous graphical adventure game created using the Adventure Creator game creation system (now called Adventure Game Studio). The game uses a mouse-driven interaction system similar to that used in Sierra 's SCI engine, where the player can choose actions like walk, talk, and interact.
Your character is tasked by an invisible man (who was rendered incorporeal in some sort of reactor accident) to save the world from a mad scientist ("Really Really Evil Ed") who is trying to destroy the world by altering the planet's axis, resulting in permanent daylight on one side and permanent night on the other side. In order to succeed in his quest, he must acquire and use mundane objects from the strange town he lives in.
