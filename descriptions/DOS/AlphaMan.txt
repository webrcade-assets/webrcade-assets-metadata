AlphaMan is a roguelike game in a futuristic/post-apocalyptic setting. Like most other roguelike games it is a "light" RPG (few stats, no character creation, no distribution of points on level-up) and uses ASCII graphics. Unlike other roguelike games, it offers you a choice of difficulty settings, allows you to save at any time and have multiple characters parallely.
The ultimate goal of the game is to locate the Grinch's stronghold and beat this powerful and psychotic enemy. To do so, you must first enter five other castles and beat the respective bosses there, each time gaining an indispensable item. The name of these bosses and castles shows a strong humorous element (Gilligan in the castaways' fortress; Buzz Aldrin, cult leader of These Who Came In Second).
