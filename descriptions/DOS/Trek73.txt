Trek73 allows players to simulate space battles between various vessels from the Star Trek franchise. It takes inspiration from the board game Star Fleet Battles. The game is played against the computer. Both the player and the computer input their commands (fire phasers, change course, launch antimatter pods, surrender, etc.) which are afterwards executed simultaneously. The game continues until either side is destroyed, outmanoeuvred or surrenders. There are a total of 31 different actions that can be taken each turn.
