Operation Com‚óèBat is a basic, turn-based strategy game. Two armies stand against each other on a battlefield with the goal to destroy the enemy headquarters. With the help of an overhead map and statistics for each vehicle, players plan their moves for each turn: moving a vehicle within a certain radius and then choosing a target to fire at. Additionally there is also a powerful air strike available which uses up a whole turn. The map can be a combination between three scenarios (change what vehicles are used) and six battlefields. There are also various options for changing the game settings, e.g. the time limit of a turn or the firing behaviour of the units.
