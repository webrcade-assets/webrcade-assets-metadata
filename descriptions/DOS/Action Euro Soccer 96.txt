Action Euro Soccer 96 is an updated version of the football game Action Soccer. The only feature that was changed is that fantasy teams like "Die tieffliegenden Hamster" ("the low-flying hamsters") or "Die fiesen Yetis" ("the mean yetis") like in the original game are now replaced with the sixteen teams that participated in the European Championship in 1996.
