The main protagonist of Möbius Roid is a young man named Masa Taniyama, who lives alone in a mansion in a quiet district, and dedicates most of his time to one activity: sex. He also has a partner to his sexual escapades, a very "active" young girl named Chie. But another young girl is raped somewhere in the neighborhood, and this changes Masa's life...Möbius Roid plays like a Japanese adventure, with the largest portion of the gameplay being dedicated to menu-based moving between locations (usually parts of a high school). In some locations, a typical "Look - Think - Talk" menu appears. The somewhat unusual feature of this game is the fact it has two protagonists: Masa and Chie. Masa is the playable character most of the time, but the player can switch to Chie, which is sometimes dictated by the game, but sometimes is a choice that can lead to different story paths (read: sex scenes).
