This is one of the earliest flight simulators created with Domark and Simis' Flight Sim Toolkit. It includes five unrelated scenarios that can be played in any order, all taking place on the same world map. Three of these involve operating civilian aircraft with no combat: in two scenarios, the task is to fly a passenger jet from one airport to another, following an AI-controlled aircraft, and another scenario is about a Sopwith Camel flight at an air show.There are also two combat missions where the player pilots an F-16. In the first one, the objective is to locate and destroy an aircraft carrier task force, and in the other, the target is a military airfield that fell into enemy hands and needs to be incapacitated.JÃ¶rg's Flight-Sim was released as freeware by its author.
