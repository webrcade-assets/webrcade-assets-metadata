The human population has exploded, and now vast numbers of ships are being sent out to colonize new worlds for humans to live on. You have been elected to be ruler of the colony founded by the people who crossed the galaxy with you. Now show them that you are a good leader, and raise your new home from a barren rock to the next metropolis of the galaxy.
Colony was a game intended to be a simulation of the development and management of a space colony, with the concept of " SimCity on another world". It was written in QuickBASIC, first as a pure text-based simulation, and later as a simpler graphical game. As the player, you start on the surface of a barren world and must start developing the structures needed to keep a population alive and productive.
