This clone of Boulder Dash is a freeware attempt to popularize this game on PC and Amiga, while it was originally released on Commodore C64 platform back in 1984 .
The game introduces VGA graphics and sound card support, but uses the caves developed for original Boulder Dash, Rockford's Revenge and C64 Boulder Dash Construction Kit as well as other unofficials.
The game includes tools to edit new caves and convert X-BoulderDash files and C64 Boulder Dash Construction Kit files to Boulderoid format.
Because of pressure from the original makers of Boulder Dash, Boulderoid's developers have been forced to stop working on this project, leaving its last version to be 1.15. On April 10, 2000, they've been forced to take it off their site.
