Abenteuer im Wald is an educational freeware game about the wood industry. It was published by an Austrian trade association and therefore concentrates on teaching about the economical impact of the forest. During the game, the player visits four industries (forest, paper, wood panels and tourism) and learns about their business.
After choosing either the boy or girl protagonist, the player meets a friendly ghost and follows him into the woods. The goal is to convince the 13 forest ghosts to make the protagonist one of their own. In order to so, they travel through the forest and bordering businesses and help the forest owners to make a living.
The player character is directly moved with the mouse (no animations) and clicking while being near an interactive object triggers an action. Abenteuer im Wald is an interactive story; progressing usually only requires finding and using the next point of interest or initiating a multiple-choice dialogue.
