This is a first-person adventure game which plays similar to a role-playing dungeon crawler without experience points. The dungeon is explored step by step (either by mouse or keyboard) and requires collecting and using puzzles items to progress. The inventory additionally holds utility (e.g. armor or weapons) and recovery items which improve health when used.
Sometimes is is required to converse of fight with people. Combat takes place on a separate screen and both combatants have three postures: neutral, attack and defense. After entering the attack stance with a left click, the strength bar fills up and a second click attacks the enemy. Unless they are in a defense stance, they take attack based on how much strength was used. While waiting for the bar, the player is exposed to enemy attacks. The defense stance is entered and left with a right click and blocks attacks. Whoever loses all health first, loses the fight.
