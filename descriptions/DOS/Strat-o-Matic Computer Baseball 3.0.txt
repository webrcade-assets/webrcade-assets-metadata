Strat-o-Matic Computer Baseball 3.0 is a statistics-based baseball game for DOS.
An entirely text-based baseball title with optional graphics, all game decisions are based upon player statistics and dice rolls.  Allows for two-player games, or one player versus the computer.  The player can choose to manually roll dice and input the values into the computer, or can have the computer roll.
Version 3.0 represents the first stand-alone version of the statistics based baseball game, and does not require a physical copy of the original cards or board to play.
