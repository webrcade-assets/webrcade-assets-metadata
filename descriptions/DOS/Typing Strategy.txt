Typing Strategy is a program that teaches you how to type. It includes two typing games: Time Bomb and Drag Race. In Time Bomb, there is a bomb that will explode unless you press the right key in time. In Drag Race, you race against the computer to type a sentence before the computer does. Progress in typing the sentence moves your car closer to the finish line. In both games, you can select your typing proficiency in order to configure a challenging but possible to win game.
