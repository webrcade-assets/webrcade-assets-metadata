GROT Inc. (General Retail Operations Training) is a simulation of retail stores for 2â€“4 players. Each player acts as the manager of a different competing department store, and the winner is the store with the highest net worth at the end of the game. (The number of turns in a game is random and hidden from the players.) Decisions made by one store may affect other stores. Each turn simulates a week of operation.
The way to influence a department store is through the Decision Input screen. This lets the player set various values, such as margin (set by department), number of sale items (by department), advertising, and so on. In order to set the correct values, examination of the reports is necessary. This includes the balance sheet, cash management, general report, and so on.
