Terra Incognita is an action platformer. In 1776, the settlers of the just-founded city of Buenos Aires send a group of brave expeditionists to the faraway cold regions of the Tierra del Fuego peninsula. Unfortunately for them, their ship finds a tragic end in the icy southern Atlantic Ocean, and the only survivor (biologist Sebastian de Anchorena) will now have to find his way through the monster-infested Terra Incognita in order to get back home.
