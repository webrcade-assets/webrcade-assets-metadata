Azalta: Cult of the Raven is a single-player role-playing game. It was released as shareware to promote both the Azalta game development product, 'Azalta Creator', and the game Azalta Traveller which is the fully registered version of the game in which players can travel to other worlds.
At the start of the game the player creates and names a group of four characters choosing the race, class and sex of each. Once this is done the game begins with the characters at the gates of Haana, a small town. The group enters the town, purchases supplies and equipment before setting off on their adventure to explore dungeons, fight monsters etc as they investigate the source of evil in the land, could it be that 'The Cult of the Raven' has reformed?
