In Terminator 2029, the player is a member of John Connor's Special Operations Group tasked with destroying Skynet. The game is a first-person shooter, although restricted to the 4 compass directions (i.e. turning, using the arrow keys, spins the player around 90 degrees). The character is wearing the Advanced Combat Armor with configurable slots for easily switchable weapons. This comes in handy, as new weapons and attachments are acquired throughout the game. The cross-hairs are moved using the mouse, with the left button being the trigger.
