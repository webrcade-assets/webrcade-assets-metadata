An army of imps has taken over your computer screen, and they're transporting lost souls, zipping randomly across the playfield. Your objective - to free the sinful souls by trapping the imps, with the help of a huge glass.  Carefully watch the green little prancing creatures, position the cursor, and drop the glass to capture as many as you can.  This will determine how many points you get, and if you manage to painfully pinch their tails with the edge of the glass, your accuracy (and sadism) will earn you a bonus multiplier.
The single-player mode is a race against the clock; two players can compete against each other, taking turns. Each player gets a total of 100 seconds to free as many souls as possible (very lucky shots will award you with free attempts).  The best 50 scores are recorded, and the high scores table can be cleared and even restored later if desired.
