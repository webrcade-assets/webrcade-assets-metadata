Spell-A-Saurus is an educational game for elementary school children.  The game has a prehistoric theme using dinosaur characters.  It consists of four mini-games: AstroDrive, Zug Escape, Ptera-Ptutor, and Spell-A-Saur, centered around unscrambling, spelling, or otherwise writing words.  The player can choose a list of words to use for each game, or create one from scratch.  Spell-A-Saurus also has an early text-to-speech feature with compatible sound drivers.
