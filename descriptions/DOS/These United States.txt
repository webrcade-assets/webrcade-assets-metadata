Up to four players may take part in this educational game, which tests one's factual knowledge of the fifty states comprising the USA.  Two basic forms of quiz are included - one is State Comparison, where two random states are selected in each turn, and the player is asked to compare different aspects of the two (area, population, population density, largest metropolitan area, highest elevation).  The other is States Facts, which highlights one state at a time and poses factual questions about it (its name, two-letter code, capital, largest city, and the year it was admitted into the Union).3 difficulty levels are available for the comparison game, and the facts game can be set to order the states alphabetically or randomly.  The question timer is adjustable (1 minutes, 3 minutes or unlimited), and if you find yourself hard-pressed for answers, the computer can be asked for a hint.
