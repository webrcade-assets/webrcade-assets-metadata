Maxi Bourse International is the computer version of the stock market board game of the same name published in France by Schmidt.
2 to 6 players (with at least one of them being human) roll dice and move around an invisible game board with spaces designating 40 different real international corporations, while buying, selling and trading their stocks and trying to build up own conglomerates and monopolies. Stock prices get changed on each bidding according to supply and demand. The board also has spaces dedicated to random events as well, including personal rumors and international or interior news.
In difference from the original board game, the computer version features three difficulty levels: you can choose not only the full board with 40 companies, but also lesser versions with 30 or 16 companies, thus making the playing time shorter.
