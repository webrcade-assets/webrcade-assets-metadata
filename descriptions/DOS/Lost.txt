Lost is a text adventure developed with the Text Adventure Development System. When you saw a meteor crash into the forest, you went after it, at night, armed only with a peanut butter sandwich and a flashlight of dubious quality. You then got lost. But not lost in the forest; the meteor was really a ship that can travel through both time and space, but only to specific points, and your home is no longer on that list. You will need to explore the various worlds to find your way back home. Locations include Venus, Mars, Pluto, Europa, and more.
Lost was distributed as shareware. Registered users would get maps and a hint book.
