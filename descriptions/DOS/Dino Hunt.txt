Dino Hunt is a single-player shareware game. The objective is to get Nicky Neanderthal back to his cave after first hunting the many dinosaurs that inhabit the area. Points are scored for each dinosaur killed. Nicky is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. He can move over ground and through grass but cannot pass through bushes or water. The spear is thrown by pressing the space bar. Entering Nicky's cave ends the current level and starts the next. The five levels get progressively harder as dinosaurs become faster and more abundant.
