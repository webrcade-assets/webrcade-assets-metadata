Fort Boyard: Le Défi is an adaptation of the TV show Fort Boyard and aims to recreate the same structure and experience as the TV show.Players compete in a series of timed trials in various cells to earn enough keys to open Fort Boyard's treasure room. They then compete against the Masters of Time to earn more time inside the Treasure Room. Finally, they spend more time in the cells in which every success earns them clues to guess the codeword that will unlock the treasure.The game has lots of FMV sequences, including some with the well-known characters of the show (La Boule, Père Fouras, Passe Partout, etc.). The game is controlled entirely using the mouse.
