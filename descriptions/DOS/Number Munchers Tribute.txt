This is a shortened tribute to the original Number Munchers made by Mecc. It is an educational game for grades 3-8. It teaches you six different types of math multiples, factors, primes, equality, inequality and challenge. Their are unlimited levels and their is a highscore along with the game. The game still features all the troggles and their is a safety grid to keep you safe from getting eaten by the troggles, it will also make the troggles disappear if they touch it.The game does not feature any cartoon shorts after every three levels like in the original version. There is also a different menu and everything moves faster than in the original version.
