Ultimate Baccarat is a simulation of Baccarat for up to six human players. (Remaining players will be computer-controlled.) It uses the common (Punto banco) rules, which is a game of pure chance; the player's only choice is whether to bet on the player's hand, the dealer's hand, or a tie (which pays 8:1). The game includes rules, and has an integrated tutor. It can be controlled using the keyboard or a mouse.
Ultimate Baccarat was distributed as Shareware. The unregistered version only allows a single player, and does not save player information between games.
