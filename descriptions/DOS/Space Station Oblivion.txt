In this game you take control of a drilling machine and explore a 3D world, which is on the brink of exploding. Time is running out for the moon and when it blows up it will take your home planet with it.
The main idea of the game is to drill into the earth and relieve the gas build up. Your machine has a laser cannon to help fight off security lasers, you can also enter various buildings to find the gas build up. The game is divided into sectors in which you find a place to leave a vent and then proceed to the next sector. You control the machine by mouse clicking on the control panel at the bottom of the screen which also tells you the condition of the gas build up.
