Ultima Collection is a compilation, which features the first eight Ultima games, the two Add-ons for the part 7's and the Ultima predecessor Akalabeth.
All those games are on one CD, which also includes all the manuals both as Word documents and Windows Help files.
The following games are included:

Akalabeth: World of Doom (the first release on the platform)
Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness
Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress...
Ultima III: Exodus
Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar
Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny
Ultima VI: The False Prophet
Ultima VII: The Black Gate
Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue (add-on for The Black Gate)
Ultima VII: Part Two - Serpent Isle
Ultima VII: Part Two - The Silver Seed (add-on for Serpent Isle)
Ultima VIII: Pagan (with Speech Pack)

In addition, the Ultima Collection also features a video interview with Richard Garriott about the (at the time of release) upcoming Ultima IX: Ascension and the Ultima Series itself.
There is also an Ultima Atlas included in the box, which features all the navigation maps from the first eight Ultima games, and the box itself offers a special Inside Cover, which shows a time-line of the Ultima games included.
While the games are DOS only, some of the bonus content requires Windows.
