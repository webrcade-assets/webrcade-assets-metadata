The plot of Trauma is simple, destroy anything that moves in your role as pilot of one of the different empires that are fighting for Earth control. All of them have their own personality and also different strong -and weak- points. Are you ready to try luck with any of them? You will be able to do so through the campaign mode, with an interesting "managerial" menu (Raptor-like) before starting every mission. Also, you dispose of a two-player mode that allows a friend to pilot a ship alongside you in the respective mode.
Once inside one of the teams, you will notice that you also can choose different pilots and spaceships, thorough which you will have to face lots of explosions and swarms of enemies that bombard you nonstop (by air or land) from the very first level, but in order to make things easy, you will also dispose with the help that a great array of weapons and power-ups will offer you through the diverse levels, all that with the company of speedy techno melodies which will remind you to the best times of Epic Megagames.
