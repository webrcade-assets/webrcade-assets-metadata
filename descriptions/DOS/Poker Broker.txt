Poker Broker is a single player, freeware, poker game.This poker game is similar to 'jacks or better' video poker. The player stars with $5000 and can bet as much as they want on a hand. They are then dealt five cards and can chose to swap any, all, or none of them. There is then a second deal and any hand with less than a pair of jacks loses, hands with a pair of honour cards get their stake back and above that they win multiples of their stake.There is no save game feature and no high score table
