Shareware Simulation Games is the sixth of seven shareware CDs in Aztech's Home Entertainment series. It is a compilation of DOS games most of which can, very loosely, be described as simulations.The games in this compilation are all shareware, freeware or demonstration games. They are accessed via 'QuikMenu' a shareware menu system which itself frequently reminds the user that it requires registration. Some of the games will run directly from the CD while others, denoted by white entries on the menu, must be copied to the player's hard drive.It's not unusual in compilations like this for the publisher to get the name wrong and there are several errors in this product which is why the following list shows two names for some entries. Each game can be selected via the mouse or by pressing a letter of number key, the order they appear in the list below is the order of the keys on the menu so 'A' selects F117, 'B' selects Monopoly and so on.The games in this compilation are:* F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0 called just F117 in the menu.TEGL Monopoly called just MonopolyWar-8}! renamed Lob Wars in the menuPaper Airplanes : This is not a game, it prints the design for a paper dart on a sheet of paper complete with the markings of the player's choicePatriot CommandCaddiehack called Caddy Shack in the menuCrime Lab: Case Of The Missing Masterpiece shortened to 'Crime Lab'.Corncob 3DDragcity U.S.A. retitled Dragster City in the menuFamily FeudSouthern Ontario Area Airports a scenery add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0Bulls and Bears by Ronald L.
