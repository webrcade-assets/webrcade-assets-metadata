In this installment (#40) of the Blender competition, participants were urged to submit works engaging the themes of "Superhero", "robbery" and "England". While Captain Britain is nice for traditionalists, the authors here have selected Mad Cow Man as the zany protector of the British Isles in the madcap late '90s. You search text-rich portions of London for his sidekick, Deep Fried Beef Fat Boy, last seen absentmindedly wandering the city in a hangover-induced amnesiac stupor. Collect clues and essential superhero supplies from Watford Station to Picadilly Circus and all points (well, several points) between, taking one of the least efficient routes possible between the grottiest bathroom in old London Towne and the convoluted subterranean labyrinths hidden in its sewers.
