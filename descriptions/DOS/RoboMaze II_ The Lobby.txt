You are a freedom figher, storming the giant tower of the dictator of your country. He has created robots with genetic parts to defend his tower. There are lots of levels split over three episodes. It is a platform game, with PC speaker sound effects and EGA graphics. You run about all the levels shooting robots, getting keys and getting money which can be used for "powerups" which are like spells that you could cast using the number keys.  An interesting feature the author put in was hybrid robots, or enemy robots mixed with parts of other enemies. For instance the legs of a knifeman and the torso of a cannon-robot.
