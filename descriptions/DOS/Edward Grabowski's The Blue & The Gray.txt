Edward Grabowski's The Blue and the Gray gives a chance to fight the American Civil War. Players control either the Federal (blue) or Confederate (gray) army, starting in July 1861. They have four years to defeat the other side by capturing the opposition's cities and winning military conflicts. Play takes place at two levels: first, divisions are moved across a map of America in a turn-based game at the campaign level; then when two forces meet, a Micro Miniatures battle takes place with the result having its effect on the campaign level.This game gives players the chance to rewrite history, by choosing the course that the war will take. The computer uses historical records to determine the recruitment of forces and availability of weapons over time, so that both sides have approximately the same "raw material" that they did in the real war. Victory highly depends on the efficient use of these resources.
