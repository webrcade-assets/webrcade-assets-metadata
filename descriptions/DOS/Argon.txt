Argon is an Asteroids variant. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and must destroy all asteroids floating around the screen. When all asteroids are eliminated, a new level with higher difficulty begins. In later levels, the asteroids break up into smaller pieces when hit, they move faster, and enemy spaceships take shots at the player’s ship. Each time the player is hit, they lose a life. If the player runs out of lives, the game is over.
The significant difference from “Asteroids” lies in the controls: instead of rotating and using thrust for movement, the spaceship is moved directly across the screen with little inertia and the ship can only shoot horizontally. The screen wraps around itself.
