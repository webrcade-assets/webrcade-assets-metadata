Dunkle Schatten is a point-and-click adventure in the typical LucasArts style. It was distributed for free by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior as a "countermeasure" against violence and anti-semitism.
In this adventure, you play as Karsten, a teenager who helps creating a youth centre so the local youth stays off the street and doesn't do things they shouldn't do. But that's easier than thought - there's much disturbance by a local gang of Neonazis.
The game wants to show that violence is not an option and every conflict can be solved peacefully.
