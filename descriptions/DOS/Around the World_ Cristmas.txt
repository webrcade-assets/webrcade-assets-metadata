Around the World: Cristmas is a Christmas-themed adaption of Around the World. Unlike its predecessor, it lacks a story. The game includes two new snow levels and features slightly adjusted physics - Wolf now slides on snow. The assets have been transformed into Christmas-themed elements; for instance, enemies are now Santa Claus and snowmen, and Wolf collects presents instead of gems. Despite these changes, the game mechanics remain identical to the original.
