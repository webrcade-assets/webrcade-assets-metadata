Pune is a light cycle / snake -type game for multiple human players, directly based on the earlier Amiga game Dune 3 (AKA Achtung, die Kurve). Each player controls one of the worms that continuously slither across the playfield, and can smoothly guide it in arbitrary directions by steering it left and right. Running into the walls or into other worms means death, so your aim is to survive as long as you can, by tricking the other players into suffering that fate instead.
The action is accompanied by digitized cheers, curses and death screams. Fatalities may be avoided by passing through the occasional gaps that appear in the worms' bodies; as in the original game, you earn a point when any other player snuffs it - no points are awarded for threading the holes (unlike other clones, such as Viper), and the total score required for victory depends on the number of players.
