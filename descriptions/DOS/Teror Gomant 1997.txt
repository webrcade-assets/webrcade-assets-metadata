A turn-based strategy game that's all about blowing up computers, and killing lamers and computer journalists while you're at it! In a futuristic 1997, the world is beset by chaos, and a totalitarian force known as the M$ Empire (now who could that be) sets out to convert the populace into a horde of lobotomized zombies, presumably through a computing experience that destroys the mind. A merry band of trigger-happy terrorists therefore sets out to destroy all those M$-ridden machines.Six different levels are available, and each one gives you one or more men to command, with limited ammunition: the target is to destroy all computers as efficiently as possible. Lamers just block your path, but the evil journalists will turn your men into lamers if they touch! Shooting the hacks will spawn demented zombies that blindly fire in random directions. You can also bolster your ranks by freeing hostages, who promptly join your team. If all your men are shot down (or brainwashed into lamer-dom), you lose; if you manage to take out all the unwholesome machines, you're scored based on how many men and bullets you have left.
