A building is on fire and you have to rescue babies jumping (jumping?) from the building. A two man fire fighter team is the only thing between life and certain death for the bouncing babies. Use the fire fighter stretcher/trampoline to bounce the babies safely into the ambulance. The gameplay is based on a Game & Watch game called Fire.The game has only three keys to play (1, 2, 3) which represents the positions where you can place your fireman team: left, middle, or right. Anticipate where the babies will fall from their jumping angle. Multiple and faster babies will jump off the building as you advance in the game.
