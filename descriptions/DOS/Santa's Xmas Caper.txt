Despite being published by the same company and sharing the same title, Santa's Xmas Caper on the Amiga is different from its 8-bit cousins. Instead of a scrolling shoot 'em up, it is a platform game.
While riding on his slide, Santa loses all his pressies. The gifts scattered all across the country, Santa must traverse multiple-scrolling platform-levels collecting them back. When they are all collected, an exit opens granting him access to the next level.
Each level is crowded with spiky pitfalls, slippery platforms and cute-looking but nasty baddies. By throwing snowballs, the baddies can be stunned for a short while.
Complete all seven levels and Christmas will be saved.
