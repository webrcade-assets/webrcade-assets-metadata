Blupimania is an isometric action puzzle game featuring Epsitec 's trademark yellow egg-shaped characters called "Blupi". The objective of each level is to guide Blupi safely to the exit, marked by a purple balloon that takes Blupi to the next stage. To this end, the player can manipulate the game environment in many ways, placing or removing objects, and in some cases, controlling Blupi directly, although by default, the characters roam the level on their own. In a way, the game is similar to Lemmings, but the amount of objects and Blupi's abilities makes it much more complex, allowing for rather intricate situations for the player to solve.
The game is split into four sets of levels with puzzles of increasing difficulty. The first part is essentially a set of tutorial levels that gradually introduce the player to the various in-game objects and playing concepts. In addition, there is a built-in level editor that allows users to create and play their own puzzles.
Blupimania was originally sold as shareware, with the unregistered version offering a few puzzles from each difficulty setting. The full game contains over 150 puzzles.
