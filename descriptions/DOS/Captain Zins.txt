Captain Zins is an advertisement adventure for the Dresdner Bank, one of Germany's big capital conglomerates.
Your game character is the average computer kid: young, gifted and glued to the screen. No wonder a nice, but rather crazy scientist asks you to be transferred into a computer, become some sort of hero software and fight the evil Mr Money.
As "Captain Zins", you solve puzzles to guard the "Dresdner Service Cards" and innocent computer bits. Your adversaries are usurious interest, loan-sharks and "balance man" - all depicted in very cuddly comic graphics.
The game is played like every typical point-and-click adventure. Since it is an advertisement for a German company, it is only available in Germany.
