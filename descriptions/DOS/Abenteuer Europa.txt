Abenteuer Europa is a promotional game by the German party SPD to reach new voters for the election of the European Parliament in 1994. In this game you are playing as journalist Fred Beck who travels through countries of the European Union while revealing a conspiracy of organized crime.The gameplay is focused on solving straightforward inventory puzzles and finding small objects. Conversations are multiple choice and have no bearing on the game - if you choose the wrong answer you just have to try again until you find the right one. The handling is similar to Cruise for a Corpse : Right-click on a object and choose the appropriate command.Between scenarios you have to read short texts about European problems and what the SPD thinks to be the right solutions to them. In these texts are hidden letters which result in a password to participate in a lottery.
