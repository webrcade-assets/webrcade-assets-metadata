Animated Multiplication and Division is a shareware educational title that aims to teach mental arithmetic to American school children in first, second and third grades
The pupil chooses between either multiplication questions or division questions and selects the presentation style that suits them best. They then choose to answer questions either based on a specific number in the range 1-10 or a mixture of these numbers.
Once the configuration questions have been answered the game asks a series of questions in the form 8 x ? = 16, or 16 รท ? = 2, leaving the player to enter the appropriate number. When all questions have been answered the player is rewarded with a mini game.
