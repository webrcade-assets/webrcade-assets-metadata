When all words are filled the location will be passed, and Daffy will be allowed to proceed further. Also different enemies such as Elmer Fudd, Sylvester J. Pussycat, Yosemite Sam, or Wile E. Coyote are present in locations. They want to kill Daffy, but Daffy can stun them with different weapons, such as bananas or eggs.
