Sequel to Aces of the Pacific, Aces over Europe takes place in the Western Theater of Operations during WW2. Fly fighters and fighter-bombers for either England, Germany, or the United States, escorting heavy bombers, attacking ground troops, or just taking control of the skies over Europe.
Aces over Europe features improved graphics over its predecessor, including smoother models and individual squadron markings on planes. Terrain graphics have also been slightly enhanced to aid in navigation. AOE features campaign modes for all three sides. Although not truly dynamic, the campaigns feature random missions based on your plane type and squadron, making each campaign different.
Player controlled planes include the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the North American P-51 Mustang (American side), the Supermarine Spitfire, the Hawker Tempest and the Hawker Typhoon (British side) and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109, Focke-Wulf Fw 190 WÃ¼rger, and Messerschmitt Me 262.
