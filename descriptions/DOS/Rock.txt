Rock is a clone of the original Boulder Dash, featuring 256-colour graphics with smooth animations and AdLib/Sound Blaster sound effects. None of the graphics or sounds directly copy those from official Boulder Dash versions, but the playing mechanics, look & feel and level layouts appear to be identical or very closely similar.The player's goal is to mine for diamonds in underground caves that are filled with earth and rocks, and sometimes are home to hostile creatures. In each level, it is required to collect a set amount of diamonds and reach the exit before the timer ticks down to zero. More diamonds than required may be collected for extra points, at the risk of delaying too much to get to the exit in time. The player has to cautiously dig tunnels in the earth, keeping in mind that rocks will fall without support and may crush the player or block a path, possibly resulting in an unwinnable situation. There are also hostile creatures that will chase the player, but can be crushed or blocked with rocks, with some exploding into extra diamonds which may be collected for additional points.The player stars with three lives ("men"), with an extra life added for each 1000 points scored in the game. Getting crushed or touched by a monster subtracts one life and restarts the level. It is also possible for the player to voluntarily restart the current level at the cost of one life if stuck. Bonus points are awarded based on the time left when the exit was reached, and on the amount of extra diamonds (if any) collected in the level.The two-player mode is identical to single-player, but players take turns to complete the game and play until losing a life upon which the turn passes to the next player.Rock was sold as shareware, with the unregistered version containing only five levels out of 20 in the full game.
