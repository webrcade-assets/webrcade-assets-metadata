Diamaze is a shareware graphical maze game, in which you play an ASCII-styled X-character. You travel in a mine collecting as many diamonds as possible and need to return to the entrance before your lantern goes out. Each game starts with a randomly-generated maze. Some diamonds are easy to get, but others require using dynamite sticks, given at the start of the level, to blast walls. To use dynamite, you press a letter on your keyboard to show which direction the blast should be aimed to. When you run out of time, you have an opportunity to see the whole maze and find what you missed.
