In this top-down vertical scrolling arcade shooter, the player controls an assault plane on its way through mechanized army forces over the Chinese territory. The plane is armed with missiles, a machine gun or a laser. The machine gun is transformed into a powerful laser, while holding the 'machine gun' key down. Progressing from stage to stage, the player should keep the plane's pilot alive eliminating the enemies. Each hit will decrease the plane's oil reserve, and the plane will crash after it is completely exhausted. Some foes drop out missiles, oil cans, and laser power cells, and players may collect or shoot them to switch between the resources to collect.
The game is available for 1 or 2 players trying to complete their mission on the same screen in cooperative mode.
