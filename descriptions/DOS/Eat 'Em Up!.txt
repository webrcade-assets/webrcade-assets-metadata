Eat 'Em Up! is a Snake / Nibbles variant with pre-set maze-like levels and slightly altered rules. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats everything in its path. Items represented by a plus sign make the snake's tail one segment longer when eaten, minus signs have the opposite effect. The objective of each level is to clear the screen of all plus signs without bumping the snake's head into a wall or into its tail.
Unlike the original Nibbles, the snake starts every level at zero length, and starts growing as soon as it eats a plus item. If it bumps its head into the tail ("bites itself"), the level is instantly lost and restarted. However, if the snake bumps into a wall, it starts to slowly lose its vitality, represented by the vertical bar at the right side of the screen, which will regenerate as soon as the snake resumes its movement. The game keeps track of how many "steps" the snake moved before completing a level, and a replay is saved afterwards. Because of this puzzle-like approach, there are no lives, and the player can retry completing a level as many times as necessary.
Eat 'Em Up! was marketed as shareware. The unregistered version contains the first 20 levels out of 100 in the full game. The levels may be played in any order.
