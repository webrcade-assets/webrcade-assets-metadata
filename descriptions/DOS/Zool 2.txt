The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 6 levels divided into 16 stages (Swan Lake, Bulberry Hill, Tooting Common, Snaking Pass, Mount Ices : 3 stages each and Mental Blockage : 1 stage). Additionally, Amiga CD32 version contains 1 extra level ( Paper Plains : another 3 stages).
Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies or temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks.
On each level, you have to collect 99% of the tokens within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed intergalactic wonderdog Zoon.
