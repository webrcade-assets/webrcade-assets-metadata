The player's task is to protect a space station from asteroids which is done by controlling four laser cannons located in the corners of the grid. These are then controlled by entering slopes (for example 2/3). In addition to shooting the asteroids it's possible to block them by constructing webs. This is done by entering the two pairs of coordinates that the web should stretch between.The following subjects are included in the game:IntegersOrder of OperationsMonomials & PolynomialsFactoringEquationsSystems of EquationsAlgebraic FractionsRadicalsQuadralic Equations
