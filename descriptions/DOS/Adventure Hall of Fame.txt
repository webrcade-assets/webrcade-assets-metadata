The Adventure Hall of Fame bundle contains six full titles on nine discs. The term adventure is used loosely, as it contains a mix of pure adventure games, adventure RPGs and action RPGs. The included games are:

Circle of Blood
Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror (not included in the French release)
Die by the Sword (base game)
Die by the Sword: Limb from Limb (add-on)

Fallout
Stonekeep

The manuals are offered on a complementary disc and some patches are included as well.
