The Dezerian Assignment is a shareware title where the player assumes the role of an agent sent to the arid world of Dezeria to retrieve a superweapon called the Galactic Vaporizer Device (GVD) which has been stolen by rebels and hidden in the tunnels beneath Dezeria's surface. The planet is divided into four quadrants with impassable walls between them, and the only way to pass from quadrant to quadrant is through an underground tunnel system. To reach the quadrant where the rebels hit the weapon, the player needs to get his hands on the red key, which is the titular RED KEY assignment.
Gameplay is focused around traversing the desert world of Dezeria in your car and making sure to keep yourself supplied with fuel, food and water. Traveling happens from a first person perspective within your car. Once you reach a location, your character exits the car and the game changes to a top-down perspective. Locations that can be visited include trading posts, where money can be exchanged for food, water, fuel, ammunition, and information - which is required to locate the Red Key. Up to sixteen items can be carried at once, some of which are useful in the quest, while others are only good for trade. Managing the inventory and resources is a core aspect of Dezerian Assignment 's gameplay.
