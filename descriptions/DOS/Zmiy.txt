Zmiy is an adaptation of the classic concept of Snake games. The player has to guide a snake through a board to eat all digits, however feeding the snake makes it grow longer. To complete the level the player must eat 9 digits, each rewarded with 10 points. Hitting the wall, obstacle or own tail takes one life. One life costs 100 points. Each time the snake dies and have at least 100 points, 100 points are deducted from the score and the player may replay the same level. The speed of the game is linked to player score - bigger score means a higher speed. Each level introduces new type of obstacles. Zmiy is entirely controlled via the keyboard.
