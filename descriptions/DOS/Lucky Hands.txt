Lucky is a two-player (one male and one female), keyboard controlled sex game.
This is at its heart a random number generator game. Both players enter their names and some basic parameters such as how nasty they want to get and how fast they want to get there. They then take turns entering a number after which the game generates a number and whoever is closest wins.
What the outcome is depends upon the stage of the game. The levels of the prize/forfeit start out with light kissing at the lower end, progressing through touching/rubbing/licking etc to light bondage, role playing scenarios and more. The forfeits are in three text files, one male file and one female file each with seventy-five instructions and one file containing fifty instructions for when there's a tie. These text files do contain spelling errors but, being text files, they can be amended to both remove the errors and/or alter some of the actions to suit personal preferences.
