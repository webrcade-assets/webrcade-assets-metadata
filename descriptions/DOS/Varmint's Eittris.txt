Varmint's Eittris is a freeware falling block puzzle game for up to four players.
The game is played entirely via the keyboard and has features such as a soundtrack, a high score table, and customisable action keys. In addition, in among the falling blocks are special blocks that can be captured by clearing the row in which they reside.
Eittris allows up to four players, human or computer, to play simultaneously and when played competitively each player has a specific 'victim' who is the target when any special blocks are activated.
When a game is over the human player's score is displayed together with a verification code so that it can be posted on the game's web site, however as at 2012 this site is no longer active.
