SpaceWORM portrays the improbable and perilous journey of a worm through space. While that much may be gleaned from the title, it's the creature's peculiar appetites that set it apart from the rest of wormkind: our worm has a passion for diamonds. Conveniently enough, large numbers of these precious gems are just lying there in the starry voids, ripe for the picking. Less conveniently, the heavens are also teeming with that popular space trope: closely-packed asteroids!
As the worm proceeds downwards through the scrolling playfield, it must be guided by swerving it left and right to avoid incoming space rocks and to collect the yellow diamonds. Each diamond scores one point; if the sinusoidal squirmer smacks into an asteroid, the game ends instantly with a display of the final score. Of course, appetite comes with eating, so the worm will increase its speed over time (making the game gradually more difficult).
