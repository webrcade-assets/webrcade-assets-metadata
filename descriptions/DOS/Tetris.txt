This Tetris version is an unofficial DOS adaptation of the puzzle game. At the top of the screen blocks appear one at a time. These blocks move slowly downwards where they pile up. The player can rotate and move the blocks so they form lines, which will then disappear. The longer the game lasts, the faster the blocks fall down.
