Isle of the Dead is a mixture between a first-person shooter and a traditional point-and-click adventure game. While walking through a level in a FPS mode you can examine certain areas closer and the game switches to adventure mode. The shooter part is visually and technically similar to Wolfenstein 3D. The player controls an apparently sole survivor of a crash, stranded on a tropical island in the South Pacific. The hero must hunt for survival items, weapons and a way to get off the island. Hideous zombies, vicious wolves and other horrors await him.
