Kriegsmarine is a strategic naval simulation of German and Allied forces in the Atlantic during World War II.
Designed for 1â€“2 players, each player controls either the Allied or German forces. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is of the theater naval commander, and the player composes task forces, establishes missions and destinations for those groups, and responds to operational events.
The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units. Gameplay included nine historical scenarios, including: Battle of the River Plate, End of the Bismarck, the Sinking of the Charybdis, the Battle of North Cape and several lesser-known actions involving German commerce raiders. Players can also create custom scenarios, including: open ocean encounter, channel dash, coastal engagement and convoy defense.
During each gameplay segment, the player sets taskforce management, where the player can combine and split ships from each group to create new groups. The player also sets movement orders for their ships. The player adjusts battle doctrine for each group, including open/close range rules, rules of engagement, and tactical guidance. The player's vessels then follow their commanding officer's directions for an interval, at which point they await new orders.
