An illustrated text adventure in the style of late-era Infocom.
Twilight's Ransom is set in the fictional Liberty City, and casts the player as Ron Mulligan, a graphic artist in love with Maria Chavez, a Salvadoran immigrant working as a waitress and taking classes at the local college. One Saturday date night, Ron heads for her apartment to pick her up, only to find it ransacked and Maria missing. The phone rings, and her kidnappers demand "the goods" by sunrise or they will kill her. Ron must take to the streets and find clues to find and rescue Maria, and will discover some nasty secrets about her involvement in this mess.
