The interstellar pilot and Casanova-wannabe Rex Nebular is hired by Colonel Stone for a hefty sum to travel to a distant planet and retrieve a vase that supposedly holds great sentimental value to him. On the way Rex's ship is attacked and he crash-lands on a mysterious planet. Further inspection reveals that this planet is inhabited solely by women; in a terrible war between sexes, the female population annihilated the male one with biological weapons, and is now artificially procreating with a device called the Gender Bender. Rex is soon captured by the planet's cruel elite forces and must find a way to escape while preserving his virility.Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender is a puzzle-solving adventure game with light erotic and comedy elements, somewhat influenced by Leisure Suit Larry and Space Quest series. The interface resembles the one used in most LucasArts games of the time period: the player chooses verbs from a menu at the bottom on the screen, interacting with objects on screen. Some collected items have their own, unique actions that can be performed with them that are not available on a general list of possible actions. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based. The game is linear but some goals may be achieved in different ways. There is no way to get stuck - the game does not allow the player to progress further beyond specific moments without all the needed objects or actions. Three difficulty levels are available what makes some puzzles more or less complex - in the easiest difficult level some actions are not required or/and some objects may not exist at all.The game has four different endings and only one of them is a happy one. The endings depend on the actions the player did (or did not do) in the final section of the game.
