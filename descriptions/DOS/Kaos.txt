Kaos is a first-person shooter game similar to Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and to some extent, Quake. Available to the player are six weapons including the usual pistol, shotgun, machine gun and rocket launcher, to be used against various monsters that inhabit the levels, and several powerups such as temporary invincibility to give an extra edge. A unique feature is the split-screen multiplayer mode with up to three players on the same computer.The game was released as freeware in an incomplete state after the initial plan to sell it as shareware had been abandoned by the authors. There are only three single-player levels (out of a total of 13 single-player level slots in the data file). A fully functional level editor is included which allows the users to create more maps and even entire custom level sets which can be loaded using a command line option.
