Tracon: Air Traffic Control Simulator lets you play the role of controlling the air traffic at the Los Angeles airport. The gameplay screen only consists of an air traffic control radar, indicating incoming air traffic. Besides the radar, synchronized speech also alerts your attention to the incoming traffic. Directing traffic is done so by typing in commands to designated airplanes.
