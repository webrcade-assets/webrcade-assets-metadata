Gobbler is a single player shareware game, which plays a bit like Pac-Man.
The game takes place in a maze. Throughout the maze are tokens of some sort that the player must collect to score points. Only by collecting all the tokens can the player clear the level and progress to the next. There are, of course, ghosts patrolling the maze and contact with them ends the game.
Unlike Pac-Man there are no power pills that allow the player to overpower the ghosts, this is a puzzle game that is purely about planning a route around the maze while avoiding them.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled, uses character graphics and has sound effects. The registered game allows the players to alter the action keys used to navigate the maze while the shareware game does not.
