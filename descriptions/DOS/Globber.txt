Globber is a variant of the board game Ataxx. Both players begin with two pieces in opposite corners of the board, and in each turn, a player can clone his piece onto an adjacent square, or move a piece to any place two squares away. If a player's piece is placed on a square adjacent to the opponent's piece, all of them get turned to the player's color. Once the board is full, the winner is the player who has more pieces.
Two board sizes are available, 7x7 and 10x10. The "Density" setting controls the amount of squares (chosen randomly) which are impassable to either player.
The game comes both in "VGA" and "CGA/EGA" versions, which differ in the number of colors used (256 and 4 colors, respectively). In both versions, the player can use alternate graphics which make the game easier to play on a monochrome monitor. In the VGA version, a plasma-effect background with color cycling is displayed during the game.
