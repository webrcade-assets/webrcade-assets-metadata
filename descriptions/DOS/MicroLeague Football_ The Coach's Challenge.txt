MicroLeague Football: The Coach's Challenge is an American football simulation where you play as a head coach of a team.
Before the game, you have to select the home and visiting team (both could be played by either human or computer), and make roster changes if you wish. During the game the human player can call the plays and pick the pass patterns, make substitutions for injuries etc. It is also possible to play a 'quick' game displaying just the results that could be printed.
