Young Stuff is a single player, adult, text-based adventure
The game starts with several story screens that set the scene for the game. The player takes the role of a computer repairman at a school. While working they observe a young lady pleasuring herself in an adjacent room, later they meet up - just the two of them, in the school's dark room where she reveals that her name is Kimberly - Kim for short - and she's '..never done anything like this before'.
The game takes place in the dark room which is appropriate because the only thing that is described is Kimberly and what the two people get up to together. In the top left of the screen is a thermometer-like gauge indicating Kimberly's current state of arousal - there are three states Cute & Cool; Warm & Moist; Hot & Wet - and certain actions can only be performed when the time is right. Once a climax has been achieved the player must recommence the process of arousing Kimberley from the beginning.
If there is a prolonged period of inactivity the game will 'Quit To BBS' which shows it's age and origins.
