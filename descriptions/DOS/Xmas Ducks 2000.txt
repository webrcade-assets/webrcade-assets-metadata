Xmas Ducks 2000 is a Christmas-themed add-on for Ducks. It includes two new episodes called Mulled Wine and Figgy Pudding, each spanning four levels, new items, and a set of Christmas-themed backgrounds and other graphics that can also be used with the original Ducks levels if the add-on is loaded (e.g. the rocket is replaced by a present box).The add-on is free and compatible with all released versions of Ducks. Unregistered copies of the game only allow to play the first episode of the two.
