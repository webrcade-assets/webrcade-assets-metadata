The Animated Alphabet is an educational title. In this game, players are presented with a picture and must recognize what it represents. They then type in the first letter corresponding to the object in the picture. If the playerâ€™s guess is correct, an animation starts. If the player guesses incorrectly, they can try again. After three incorrect attempts, a new picture is shown. The game features one picture for each letter of the alphabet, displayed in random order.
