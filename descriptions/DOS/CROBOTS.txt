CROBOTS is a robot programming game. You create a file with your system text editor, which contains the instructions to control a robot. Running the game then allows you to pit your creation against one to three other robots in a 1000x1000m game arena. The robots then fire cannons according to their specific programming, damaging each other until there is one robot left, or a certain time has elapsed.
The game was inspired by Core War and Muse Software's Robot War. Instead of using a game-specific programming language, the commands used to control the robot were based on a subset of the existing C language specification. Additional functions were defined which allow you to:

drive in a particular direction at a given speed;
fire a cannon in a given direction for a specified range (up to 700m);
scan for other robots in a direction using some radar beam width;
measure the current velocity, location and damage of your robot.

Four robots are provided with the game. Rabbit runs around the field randomly, and does not fire. Counter, Rook and Sniper were progressively more complicated and aggressive robots that provided more of a challenge. The game was initially released as Shareware but has now been open sourced under a GPLv2 license.
