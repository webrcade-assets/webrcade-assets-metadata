WISO Breakout is an advergame for the German economy and consumer TV magazine WISO. It is a Breakout variant and apart from the basic gameplay which is identical to the original game, there is a unique feature. There are some bricks with a question mark on it. Hitting one of these triggers a economy-related question with multiple answer possibilities. A correct answer is awarded with a bonus like a wider or faster paddle or simply by giving an extra score. When a ball is lost all of the already eliminated bricks reappear on the playfield again. It is possible to save the game progress.
