Money Bags is a game of international finance.  You're given $1 million and a year of game time to try to make it grow.  You can invest in foreign currencies, international stocks, international goverment bonds, gold, lumber, and commercial property.  You'll have to keep an eye on current events and how they'll change the markets, exchange rates, stock values, real asset values, shipping costs, and more.  In other words, it's an almost complete international finance simulator.The game has four skill levels.  The higher the level, the more unpredictable and faster things happen.  On any level but the lowest, you compete against the legendary "Gnome of Zurich," who's an international finance expert.  The game does have a pause function, and you can also continue playing after your year is up.  It also tracks the ten highest scores for each skill level.
