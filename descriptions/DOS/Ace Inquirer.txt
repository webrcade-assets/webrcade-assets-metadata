Ace Inquirer is an educational game for multiple systems.
You are the host of the Ace Inquirer TV show, and you must tell the difference between a fact and an opinion before time runs out. The player starts by receiving a message from their director, stating either a fact or an opinion expressed by the show's guests. The player then interviews the guests, who express why they believe their statement is a fact or an opinion, and give further information on who can back up this claim. The player can then call these other experts to get their reasoning, and can also look up facts and details in the studio's library. The player must then decide whether the statement is a fact or opinion, and must show what evidence backs up this claim.
