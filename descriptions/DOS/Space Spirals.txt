Space Spirals is a mouse-controlled shooting game, with some similarities to Missile Command.The object of the game is to defend a space station from attacking aliens. With the space station at the center of the screen, the player uses the mouse to move a torpedo cursor around. Press the mouse button, and the station will fire a torpedo to that location where it will explode and take out any surrounding enemies. However, the torpedoes have to travel a bit before they reach their destination so the player has to take this into account when aiming at the moving aliens.In each level, a refueling ship flies toward the space station and the player must protect it from incoming enemies. Once at the center, the ship docks with the space station and the player is rewarded with extra fuel. The levels face increasingly more difficult waves of enemies. The first 10 levels introduce all the enemy types, and each level after that features various combinations of aliens.
