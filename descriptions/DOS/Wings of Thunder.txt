Wings of Thunder is a single player game which was designed using Domark 's Flight Sim Toolkit. It was released as a complete and free game, but the author did ask for a donation if the player enjoyed the game.
In the future, the world is at peace. Weapon stockpiles are a thing of the past. Scientists have collaborated on creating artificial humanoid life, which they called "mandroids". To see how clever and resourceful these mandroids are, fifty are dumped in a secret location and left to their own devices for five years. When the time is up, humanity is alarmed to find that there are no longer fifty mandroids, but thousands upon thousands of them, and that they are on the move with the various weapons they have developed!
Agents infiltrate the mandroid homeland and plant homing devices in key locations. The objective of the game is to fly into mandroid territory, tune into the frequencies of these beacons, and destroy everything.
