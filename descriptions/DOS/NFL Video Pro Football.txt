Konami's NFL Video Pro Football lets you be the coach of your favorite NFL team or the whole league. You can intervene at any time during the sixteen game season and dictate the tempo of the game, stage a defensive attack on your opponent or perfect the run-and-shoot offense and take your team to the Super Bowl.
Through the use of film footage from NFL Films archives, every play of every game can be watched on the game's video monitor or big screen. For an overall view of the action on the field, you can also watch from the sky box which shows the entire field. You can choose from over 150 plays in the playbook and you can alter team rosters and player characteristics. Additional multimedia features such as digitized voice, sound and music allow the player to become fully immersed in the game.
