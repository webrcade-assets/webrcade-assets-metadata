Pyramid is a Pyramid Solitaire game. From a pyramid of twenty-eight cards and a draw pile of the remaining cards, remove all kings, and all pairs of cards that total thirteen until all cards in the deck are in the waste pile. A somewhat unusual rule in this version is that a card can match with a card above it in the pyramid as long as removing the lower card would reveal the upper.
This game lets the player optionally redeal the draw pile. It has mouse support, but no high score table. It was distributed as Shareware, without any locked features.
