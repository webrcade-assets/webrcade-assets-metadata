A cross between a sports trivia game and a word puzzle game. Double Talk's premise is of challenging two players to discover a certain phrase or word. You get a gameboard divided in two, each half contains 54 blocks or pieces, when it's your turn, you click on a block and you get two clues in the form of phrases or words. The trick is that those two clues relate to a separate part of the answer (which is, again, a word or phrase related to sports trivia). Answer correctly and the block gets removed. The whole point is to remove as much blocks as possible in order to see a random image that's hidden behind them, since these two images (yours and your opponents) are the final clues to the final answer (and relate to it in the same way that the blocks do).
There are a series of animated 2d effects and sound clips added to keep you going as well as a timer and score counter, but that's it.
