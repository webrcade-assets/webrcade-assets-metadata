Escape from the ELI is a text adventure set at the English Language Institute of the University of Delaware. You play the role of an international student arriving at the institute, and the game plays out as a simplified simulation of student life: making your way around campus, attending classes and so on. This game was designed by a professor of the real-life ELI, with a writing style intended for students learning English as a second language, and the game provides you with a list of possible commands to try for the first few locations.
