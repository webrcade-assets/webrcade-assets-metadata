Armored Moon is a real-time strategy game. The story revolves around the year 2040, when Earth has ran out of resources and the big evil corporations try to take over the last of the remaining valuable resources located on the moon. You lead your rebel forces in ten increasingly difficult missions to take back control of the moon.
You start each stage with an allotted amount of funds and units, your forces gain experience and become stronger with time. Most units are bipedal mechs with different weapons and hit points. There is a number of cities on each map and your objective is always to conquer all enemy cities with weak cyborg units within a time limit. Structures can be built only near friendly cities. There is no RTS typical resource gathering here, instead the cities you own generate funds in intervals.
Units are not built, they are teleported in from a limited stock for funds. If you are out of units, you need to restart the stage trying to lose less. The computer opponent has an unlimited stock and attacks regularly. By conquering cities you gain additional units to the stock. Recharging is a tactical key element here, a special unit and a building can repair units with energy bolts over a small distance.
