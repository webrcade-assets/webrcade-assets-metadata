In this ASCII rogue-like (dungeon crawls with randomized 
maps) the player explores 20+ levels of a dungeon in order to capture
a magical artifact, the Sudbury Sapphire from a group
of Imperial Dragons. Features include animated vine
traps, labyrinth traps, torches on the walls that can
be lit, and pools of vomit.
Note: MAG was originally developed in 1985 for UNIX.
