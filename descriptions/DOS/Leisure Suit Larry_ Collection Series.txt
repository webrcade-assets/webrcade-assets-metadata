Leisure Suit Larry Collection Series is, as the name implies, a collection of all Leisure Suit Larry games from 1 to 6 (with the exception of Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Case of the Missing Floppies, which never came out because "Larry doesn't believe in 4-play").
The collection comes on two discs, where the first contains DOS versions of the following games:

Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards
Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards
Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)
Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals
Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work
Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out

The second disc contains a Windows-based version of Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out featuring a revised interface and speech.
Some editions additionally include the following content:
