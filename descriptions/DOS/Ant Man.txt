Ant Man is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Korean comic series of the same name. The game lacks an in-game story, except for an introductory movie where the three heroes battle against robots and the outro. Before starting the game, players choose between three heroes: Ant Man, Fly Girl, and Flea Man. Although these characters have different appearances, they share an identical move set, including jumping, hovering (activated by holding the jump button), and shooting. Each character wields three weapons: a straight shot and two missile shots with varying angles. These weapons have limited ammo and can be changed at any time.
The game features linear levels that require the character to move horizontally, mostly to the right (occasionally to the left), toward the level boss. Along the way, players encounter enemy robots and face platforming challenges. If a player loses all their life energy, the game ends, but unlimited continues are available. Throughout the levels, players may discover power-ups such as health or ammo refills.
