1000 Miler is based on the french card games called Mille Bornes. Two players compete against each other to reach 1000 miles before the other. Each player gets seven cards, which can be miles cards for getting closer to your goal or positive or negative cards. Negative cards can be played to cause a flat tire for your opponent, letting him have a crash or other effects. The positive cards can be used to negate the effects of negative cards the opponent played on you. The winning player gets a little winning animation.
