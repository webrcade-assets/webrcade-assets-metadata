Shut the Box is a version of a classic dice game.  Players roll a pair of dice.  They then select digits from 1 to 9 that total the same number as the dice.  Once a digit is selected, it cannot be used on subsequent rolls in the current round.  When the player cannot select digits totaling the dice roll, the round is over.  The player scores points equal to the sum of the digits used that round.  If the player successfully uses all nine digits, they get five bonus points for a total of 50 points for the round.  The game consists of five rounds and, naturally, the player with the highest score wins.The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of "ANSI characters," which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.
