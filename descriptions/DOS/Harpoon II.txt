Harpoon II is a simulation of modern-era naval combat. A variety of ships such as surface and sub, as well as missile weapons and aircraft must be tracked and accounted for when engaging in battles. It is a single player game, and takes place in real-time (though you can set the clock ratio to suit your needs and even pause the game).Rather than being a straight Cold War-style U.S.S.R. vs the USA game, Harpoon II's scenarios are mostly based on third-world encounters, such as USA vs North Korea, or Peru vs Ecuador, etc. The initial release contains BattleSet: Global Conflicts I, featuring 15 missions.You take charge of a naval force composed of either few small ships armed with only cannons and light rockets/missiles, or an entire carrier strike force with it's own air force and long-range cruise missiles.
