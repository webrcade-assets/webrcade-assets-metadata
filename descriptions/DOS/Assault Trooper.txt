Assault Trooper is an isometric shooter game with tactical and stealth elements. The player controls a commando (no details are given on the government or organisation he belongs to) on clandestine solo assignments in various hot spots of the world. Missions include rescue, document retrieval, destruction of military targets, sabotage and assassinations. The ten available regions have five missions each that are gradually unlocked as more assignments are completed.
Before a mission, the player selects equipment, which is only limited by the maximum weight that the commando can carry. There are various firearms and explosives available, as well as portable medikits and armour vests. The loadout must thus be planned in accordance with the mission objectives. As the design of Assault Trooper puts a greater emphasis on tactical approach and stealth than on sheer action, simply using the most powerful weapon available is not a good approach to playing. The game documentation makes it clear that avoiding combat is often better than gung-ho tactics.
Assault Trooper was initially released as shareware, with only two regions and ten missions available in the downloadable shareware version. The full registered version includes all 50 missions plus a mission builder and a sample custom level to demonstrate how the editor works.
