Eventually, a mercenary organization known as Blade Warrior was hired to confront them. Sou, one of the youngest members of the team, is sent to deal with a gang of marauding cyborgs in the city's shady area, without realizing that this mission will be just the beginning of a dangerous journey.Zyclunt is a side-scrolling action game.
