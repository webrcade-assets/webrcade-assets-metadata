Taking sides with the aliens, the player must fight the Brazilian military forces, trying to rescue captured aliens and their spaceship. Though the game, the player will discover that a whole underground city called Stonedrome was built in southeastern Brazil, where aliens and human secret agents work together.The game engine is 2.5D, mixing 3D models (for the background objects and vehicles) and sprites for the characters. The game explores real Brazilian locations, like the Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, the Sé metro station in São Paulo, besides the city of Varginha itself.At the very beginning of the game, the player receives a Bioproc: an alien device which works both as a map and a translator. He can use four kinds of weapons, including an alien one. He'll also need to find key items to unlock areas and proceed in game.
