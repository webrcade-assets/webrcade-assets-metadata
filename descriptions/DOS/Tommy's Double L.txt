Tommy's Double L is a shareware, single-player, puzzle / strategy game for one player vs the computer.
This game is based on a puzzle devised by Edward De Bono in his book "The Five Day Course In Thinking". It is a puzzle / strategy game which is played on a 4x4 grid. Each player has an 'L' shaped piece that is 3 cells long and 2 cells wide and there are also two Jammers which occupy a single cell. Players take turns and in each turn they must move their piece and optionally one or both jammers. The game ends when a player cannot move when their turn comes around.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
