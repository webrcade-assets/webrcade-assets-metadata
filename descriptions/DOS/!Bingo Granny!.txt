!Bingo Granny! is a text-based game without graphics. All interactions with the game (except for "n" for no and "y" for yes) are multiple-choice.The player controls an old woman of 99 years (and 0 days) and the goal is to stay alive until 100.  There are a number of necessary aspects to consider: eating, using the toilet, sleeping and entertainment. The two important resources are pills (energy pills, crack pills, butt plug pills and happy pills) and money (used to buy pills and food). Besides receiving 25 dollars from the welfare office each day, the main source of income is playing bingo. Except for pressing enter to advance to the next number, the bingo process is automatic.
