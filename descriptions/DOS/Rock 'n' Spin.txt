Rock 'n' Spin is an arcade puzzle game similar to Repton 3 and Boulder Dash. The player controls an emu that must be guided through a series of mazes to the exit door, which only opens when all diamond-shaped crystals in the maze have been collected. There are obstacles in the form of the usual boulders and falling rocks that can crush the emu, as well as hostile moving spinners, which may be trapped or drop additional crystals when destroyed.The game puts its main emphasis on the puzzles, with the boulders, diamonds and other game elements arranged in such a way that often a specific sequence of moves is required to progress without finding oneself in a dead end. Unlike Boulder Dash, there is no time limit, and the player is free to replay any level for as many times as necessary to find the correct path to the exit. Moreover, the game automatically records all of the player's moves and offers to replay them upon failure to complete a level, with the player being able to take over the replay at any time and continue solving the level, which effectively acts and an auto-save feature.Rock 'n' Spin was originally developed as a shareware game in the context of the Young Enterprise charity programme for school students. Eventually the author declared it freeware and made the registered version available for download from his site. The game features high-resolution pre-rendered graphics, music and sound effects. There are 30 levels in the registered version.
