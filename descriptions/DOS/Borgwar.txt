Borgwar is a single player space shooter.The player takes the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in command of the starship Enterprise NCC-1701-D. The ship sits at the bottom of the screen and is moved left/right by the arrow keys. A huge Borg cube appears in the top left of the screen and it is the player's job to destroy it. To do this they have forward firing torpedoes, only three of which can be on-screen at a time, and phasers which are aimed via the J, K, I & M keys.The Borg ship does not fire back, it just descends down the screen very slowly and very deliberately until it corners and absorbs the Enterprise.
