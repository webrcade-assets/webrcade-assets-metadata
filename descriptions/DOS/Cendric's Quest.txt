Cendric's Quest is a graphical 1st person adventure, and a prequel to the game SerpentHead, telling the story of how the SerpentScepter parts, a key item in the main SerpentHead game, was located and reassembled by the mage Cendric. This story is just a brief part of the longer intro to the SerpentHead game itself.The game intro has King Mharim (protagonist of the SerpentHead game) retelling this story to his scribe Ritan, long after the events in the later SerpentHead game.In the past 9-days war with dragons, 5 generations ago, a sceptre was instrumental in defeating the evil sorcerer Salorann in a battle with the Royal Mage Ophiuchus.However, he was not killed, but only fled, and the mage Ophiuchus hid the sceptre parts in magically protected boxes in the Castle Irongate, to avoid it getting into the wrong hands.Now Ophiuchus has died, while Salorann has magically prolonged his life and is planning to come back.The current Royal Mage and Ophiuchus grandson, Cendric has had a premonition in a dream about Salorann returning to threaten the kingdom, and he needs to use the sceptre against Salorann when he reappears.The player takes the role of Cendric, exploring and avoiding dangers set against him by Salorann, and with the goal of finding the three golden boxes containing the parts of the sceptre, hidden in the Castle Irongate, and reassemble them.The DOS version was created with an updated version of the engine used in SerpentHead Deluxe, and the Windows version "Cendric's Quest '99" has different graphics where the game play area and story/dialogue windows are separated. The unregistered versions for DOS & Windows has identical story & puzzles.
