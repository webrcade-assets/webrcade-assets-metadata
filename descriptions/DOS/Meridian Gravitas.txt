Meridian Gravitas is a 3-d maze game. The player controls a pink cone and must touch all the small squares with it, painting them black. The maze itself is quite complex (especially considering CGA/EGA color limitations), and filled with various-shaped enemies (some of them shoot laser beams) and pyramids that kill on touch. The pink cone can levitate, raising slightly above surface. In special places it can fly very high. The game is written in C/Assembly and was distributed from author's website along with source code.
