Inspecteur Banaan en de ontvoering van Mabella (translation "Inspector Banana and the kidnapping of Mabella") is point and click adventure game, it is entirely in Dutch and it's about a cartoon inspector who has to solve a kidnapping case.
The introduction shows the front page of a newspaper and tells the story through text boxes. Shortly after arriving at Schiphol Airport yesterday evening, the famous pop singer Mabella has been kidnapped from her car while on the way to her hotel. Mabella is famous for her scantily dressed performances and shocking lyrics. It's unknown who the kidnappers are, but the police ensures the public that they will apprehend the kidnappers as soon as possible, because Inspector Banana will lead the investigation and the clues quickly point to Luigi Mancini and his Ferrari gang.
The player must guide Inspector Banana around Amsterdam, looking for clues and collecting items to find the kidnappers and free Mabella. The interface is similar to Sierra's SCI games, where you use the mouse cursor for several types of interaction. You can walk, look, grab, talk, arrest and use an item from your inventory.
The game uses cartoon characters overlaid on digitized backgrounds. The background locations are digitized photographs of real world locations in Amsterdam, such as the Elandsgracht police headquarters, The Rijksmuseum, Leidseplein, Rozengracht, The Dam and Central Station.
