Garnott 2 is a top-down, 360-degree space shooter game similar to the classic Asteroids, as well as to the Stardust game series. The player flies a ship, shown from a top-down perspective, and must use on-board weapons to dispose of enemy ships and other obstacles. These include asteroids that drift around and, if shattered by weapon file, will fall apart into several smaller rocks. Navigation in space in not straightforward, as the player's craft is subject to inertia, and collisions with enemy ships and asteroids should be avoided as they result in hull damage. Because of the inertia, the player cannot immediately change course when using the thrusters, so flying around the levels requires skill and precision.
Destroyed enemy ships drop pickups which, if collected before they disappear, will give the player bonuses and cash, which may be spent between missions on ship repairs, shield recharge, as well as to purchase additional weapons. Missions have a soft timer: when the countdown reaches zero, a powerful enemy ship will appear in the level and chase the player.
The plot of the game is apparently intended to be a parody. There's a villain called Dage Vador (also referred to as "Dr. Dage" in mission briefings) who travels around the galaxy in a cheeseburger-shaped star cruiser that houses a "mega-cannon", which he intends to use for Earth's destruction. The player's task is to prevent this from happening, but Dr. Dage's minions stand in the way.
