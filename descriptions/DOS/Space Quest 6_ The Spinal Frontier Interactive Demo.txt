The playable demo of Space Quest 6 contains a short unique scenario that is not part of the adventure in the full game.The demo starts with Roger Wilco already demoted to janitor aboard DeepShip 86. While he is performing cleaning duties outside the ship, it is approached by a mysterious Escher cube shaped vessel, and subsequently boarded by the "Bjorn", a spoof of Star Trek 's Borg (this is a reference to tennis player Bjorn Borg). The Bjorn proceed to transform all crew members into what is referred to by the game as "lemon sorbet", then begin the process of assimilation. All the while Roger remains undetected as he watches helplessly the fate of his comrades.The playable part starts as Roger gets back on board. There are several puzzles to solve before DeepShip 86's crew can be saved, spanning across the key areas of the vessel, including the bridge, Roger's quarters, the mess hall and the docking bay. The game is complete with voice-over narration and Roger's voiced lines. The option to save and load the game is disabled because the demo scenario is short and not very difficult.
