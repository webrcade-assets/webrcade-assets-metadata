In this traditional graphic adventure Caesar has conquered the whole world and so you’re living in the Roman Empire in the 20th century. You’re Gaius Ludus. You’re working in a museum as a cleaning man.
But – something is wrong. In a Caesar statue you find a mysterious message from the future. So you know what to do – save the world!
First you joined the liberty party – then you have to find the time portal. With it you travel in the past (to Caesar) and in the future. Thus changes the present…but be careful!
