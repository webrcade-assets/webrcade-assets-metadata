PC Gol is a very basic soccer simulator which skews the managerial simulation component of its direct competitor, the PC FÃºtbol series, and focuses just into playing soccer.The player can choose between isolated friendly matches against other teams or trying to win the European Championship, the World Championship or the America Cup. The gameplay and graphics are somewhat reminiscent of Sensible Soccer.
