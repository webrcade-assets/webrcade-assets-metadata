Tesserae is a 2D combination of Rubik's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics allow for endless hours of gameplay akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris for a long duration. Gameplay consists of flipping tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal is to clear the board entirely. Higher levels have added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.
