Shooting Gallery is a cute little arcade game released as shareware. It's a combination of 7 little shooting games which are all controlled by the mouse and depend on your quick mouse reactions. You'll gain points and the goal is to get as high as possible in the highscore list.
Of the 7 little games, 1 and 4, 2 and 5 and 3 and 6 are some sort of 'sequels' to each other. They are quite the same games, only a little bit more difficult. The seventh game is maybe the most fun of all, you have to shoot cowboys which are invading a family's house, and you should try not to shoot the family members.
