In the land of Akistar is a town known as Zulula that holds martial tournaments. Stories of these tournaments have spread across the land, leading to a surge of strong challengers and beasts ready to fight! The city holds many dark secrets, however, in the form of the Evil Lords who secretly rule. Can a hero not only claim fame and glory in the tournament, but also rid the city of these horrors?Champions of Zulula: Elite Edition is an expanded version of OSP's earlier Champions of Zulula. It is a slightly different take on the fighter genre with 24 different playable character types, several unique boss enemies, and multiple modes.Gameplay is somewhat simplistic with each character type having attacks, a jump, and a block. Arenas can hold up to four combatants at once, with each character being capable of moving on both the x- and y- axes. Gameplay modes include one-on-one fights (against computerized or other players), a tournament mode, the 20 Monsters Bash, and special boss fights. The game also contains many offbeat elements such as bizarre playable creatures and quirky dialogue.
