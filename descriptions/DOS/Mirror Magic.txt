Mirror Magic (also known as Mirror Magic II when version 2.0.0 was released) is a port of Amiga puzzle game Mindbender that additionally allows to play levels from another game with similar mechanics, Deflektor. It uses updated, higher-solution graphics and includes a level editor.The player controls a set of rotating mirrors which are used to direct a beam of light (laser in Deflektor and magic energy in Mindbender) to destroy mines or cauldrons that are present in the level. Apart from mirrors, there may be other objects that affect the beam's direction (some can be controlled by the player like the mirrors), resulting in puzzle-like gameplay. Once all mines/cauldrons are cleared from the screen, the beam needs to be pointed at the exit to finish the level. Each such puzzle must be completed within a time limit, as projecting the beam slowly uses up a finite amount of energy supply. If at any time the beam is directed back at the source of the beam, it will start to slowly overheat, potentially destroying the source and ending the level.The game is open source under the GNU General Public License, and thus cross-platform, initially available for Unix-like systems, but eventually ported to DOS, Windows, Macintosh and Android.
