Jasper's cat has been nabbed by a nasty witch who intends to use him as an ingredient for her incredibly evil potion! Make your way through a world of magic and monsters to reach the witch's castle and save Orlando.
Jasper's Journeys is an old fashioned jump'n'run focusing on the basics of the genre. It features level exploration, collecting gems and fruits, jumping over pits, throwing fruit energy at enemies, avoiding acid drops, unlocking doors and finding secrets. Noteworthy are big enemies, which you will encounter as boss battles, as well as normal level enemies. Also you have the chance to win each level through a bonus section, which you can access after finding three orbs in a level.
