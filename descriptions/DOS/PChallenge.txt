Written as a 16-line BASIC program published in PC Magazine, PChallenge may be described as Pong without the second player, or Breakout without the bricks, or both. The player controls a paddle, which can be moved along the bottom of the screen to deflect a moving ball and bounce it off the walls; lose all ten balls, and it's game over. The paddle comes in 3 selectable sizes, and the ball speed is controlled by an adjustable drag factor - the longer the game, the faster the action gets.
