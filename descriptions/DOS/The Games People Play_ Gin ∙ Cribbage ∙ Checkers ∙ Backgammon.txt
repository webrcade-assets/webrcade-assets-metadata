The title pretty much says it all, a game package featuring two card games (Gin and Cribbage) and two board games (Checkers and Backgammon).  Gin and Cribbage have personality based A.I. advisors and opponents.  The checkers program is endorsed by the American Checker Federation and includes official play rules such as 2-move and 3-move openings.  The backgammon  game has four variations of play (Traditional, Acey-deucy, Dutch, and Plakoto).
