Tyrone... in New York is a text adventure with an adult theme. You are being pursued by the F.B.L. (Federal Bureau of Latex) for a theft of a sex toy. You know that it was actually stolen by "Ivan Bullski", the "Wall Street Latex Futures Trader". You need to find Ivan and clear your name. On the way, you are encouraged to sleep with as many women as possible. Unlike games like Leisure Suit Larry, this game tries to be as explicit and as raunchy as possible and is definitely not intended for non-adult audiences.
