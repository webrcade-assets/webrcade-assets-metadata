Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Federation starship USS Enterprise-D, is on a mission to encounter an ultimate threat to the known galaxy. The game starts with a Federation outpost detecting an unknown ship approaching Federation space; the Enterprise is sent to deal with this new situation. The mystery ship appears to be a small scout-ship from Garid that has lost power to its engines and as a result has sailed off of its intended course. Suddenly, a Romulan Warbird battleship from Garid uncloaks itself right between the protagonist and the new ship, and thus a new story begins.A Final Unity is a hybrid game with adventure and strategy segments. Whilst on the ship the player can use the tactical console to engage in occasional battles against enemy, repair damaged systems, and select teams for away missions. These missions constitute the larger portion of the game, and are played like a traditional point-and-click adventure, including item manipulation and puzzle-solving. Dialogues may vary depending on the crew members previously selected by the player.
