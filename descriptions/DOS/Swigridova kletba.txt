The Manahon county has suffered for hundreds of years from a strange curse. Every year, on the day of winter solstice, the most important citizen of the county must blow the horn of Kerke to make spring come. But the evil wizard Swigrid hates the sound of the horn and spring as well, so he steals the horn. The player controls the simple shepherd Robin who is the only one who can defeat the evil Swigrid and return the magic horn.
