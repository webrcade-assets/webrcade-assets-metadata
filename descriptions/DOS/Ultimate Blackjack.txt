Ultimate Blackjack is a shareware card game for one to four players. The game can be used as both in blackjack tutor or in game mode. In tutor mode the player can select from four preset strategies and then sit back as the game plays automatically. Alternatively the blackjack tutor can be customised to play in a style the player prefers. In game mode the player decides whether to stand, fold, hit double up etc. The game collects statistics, has sound and an in-game manual, and can be played by both mouse and keyboard.
