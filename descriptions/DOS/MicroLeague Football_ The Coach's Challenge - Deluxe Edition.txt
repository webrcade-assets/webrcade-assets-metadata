MicroLeague Football: The Coach's Challenge is an early American football video game for DOS and part of the MicroLeague Sports series. You can create teams and leagues and play an entire season, or select from pre-determined real-life teams and players from years past. Gameplay is more strategic than most action sports games. You don't control the players directly; instead, you choose the offensive and defensive plays and the players attempt to carry them out as best they can.
The Deluxe Edition features an enhanced version of the engine from the original game. New features include more detailed player stats and ratings, the ability to assign macros using particular keystrokes, more plays to choose from and better artificial intelligence.
