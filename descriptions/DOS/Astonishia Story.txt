The game's structure and basic system are of the traditional Japanese kind and involve party management, overworld exploration, linear progression, and automatic character growth. Enemies are visibly roaming hostile areas and can be avoided. A contact with an enemy initiates a turn-based battle that contains tactical elements: the player can navigate characters on the screen and attack only if the enemy is within their weapons' range.
