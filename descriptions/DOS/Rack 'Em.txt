This two player cue-sports simulator features five different game modes - you can play standard pool, 8 or 9 ball variations, the fast-paced Bumper Pool, or the English game of Snooker, each with their rules recreated as accurately as possible. There is also an editor for the Bumper Pool game built in. In practice modes shots can be retaken. This is helpful for a beginner, as each shot involves selecting the target ball, its desired location, shot pace, and spin. A favourite shot or in-progress game can be saved, though not in the C64 cassette version.
