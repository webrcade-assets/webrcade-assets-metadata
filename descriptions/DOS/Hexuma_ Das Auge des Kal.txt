Hexuma - Das Auge des Kal is interactive fiction with graphics and a point-and-click interface.
This German-only game is the last of three text adventures created by the Weltenschmiede team, the other two being Das Stundenglas and Die Kathedrale. Hexuma sends you into an old, supposedly haunted mansion, which turns out to be a gateway to six different periods in Earthâ€™s history. Travel from the age of dinosaurs to the distant future and bring back six crystal shards to battle the sinister god Kal.
Otherwise a conventional text adventure in its design and functionality, Hexuma is aiming for the versatility record: the game knows six different ways to enter a command. You can simply type it in. You can click on objects in the graphic window to trigger the most probable action. You can piece your sentence together in an icon menu. You can consult a list of pre-fabricated commands tailored to the situation. You can click on any word in the text screen to copy it in the command bar. And, strangest of all, you can enter your command letter by letter with the mouse on a display of a keyboard. Talk about German diligence.
There are a few puzzle dead-ends, so you might consider saving frequently.
