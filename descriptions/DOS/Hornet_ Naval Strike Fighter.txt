Hornet: Naval Strike Fighter is the second official add-on for Falcon 3.0, which allows the player to fly a U.S. Navy or Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet. It also introduces the Bosnia and Herzegovina theater, and its missions are intercompatible with both the base game and the previous add-on, MiG-29: Deadly Adversary of Falcon 3.0.
