Tommy's Trek is a variant on an old classic. This is a single-player, keyboard controlled game with basic sound, bleeps and whistles. The game has one unusual feature, an autoplay mode. It starts in this mode and plays by itself until the player intervenes and take's over. There are nine difficulty level settings.The game itself is similar to many others in this genre. Each sector of the universe is an 8x8 grid containing stars, starbases, and Klingon starships. Within this sector you can navigate to any point on the grid with impulse engines, or venture to a new sector using Warp engines. Your ship is equipped with phasers, torpedos and space mines to help defend yourself, and both long and short range scanners to assess the nearby threats and nearby sectors. Starbases are necessary for restocking the Enterprise.The Klingons will, of course, fight back. When they do it is likely that the Enterprise will suffer damage and this will affect it's ability to fight and/or run away, for example if the short range scanner is damaged the Enterprise will not be able to see the enemy, if the phaser control is damaged most attempts to fire phasers will fail etc.Other hazards in space are random black holes which suck everything in and spit it out in a random location, and cloaked Klingons. Occasionally starbases come under attack and the Enterprise must warp to their location and destroy the attackers if the base and resupply point is not to be lost.There are also command line switches to start the game without sound, force a colour display and another to force a monochrome display.
