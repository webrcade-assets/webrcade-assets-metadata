Ultizurk II: The Shadow Master is the sequel to Dr. Dungeon's first Ultizurk game and was released in the same year. It uses the same engine with the same tiny viewport and the same controls. Like its predecessor, its main inspiration are the early entries of the classic Ultima series.
The main gameplay improvement in Ultizurk II is that monsters now move rather than standing in place waiting for the player to approach, making it harder to avoid them. Other than that, it plays pretty much the same as the first Ultizurk: dialog uses a keyword system, there is no character creation, and the player only controls a single character.
The biggest difference is in setting: while the first Ultizurk was a straight fantasy game, the sequel mixes it with some science fiction elements - the intro mentions a mysterious message from Andromeda, while the game is set on an alien planet to which the player has been teleported by magic.
