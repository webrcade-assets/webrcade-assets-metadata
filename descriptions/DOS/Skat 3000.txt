Skat 3000 is a simulation of the card game skat and the successor of Skat 2095. There are many variants, but here is the principle: the game is usually played with three persons. Two of the players are playing against a single one, but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called "Trumpf". In every round each player loses one of his cards and the one who played the "Trumpf" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no "Trumpf" is played, the highest value wins. At the end each player counts the value of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.
The main feature of Skat 3000 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules. It also has a tutorial, animated graphics and voice acting. In comparison to Skat 2095 it features more opponents and a better playing AI. In the shareware version are several restrictions present, e.g. no adjustable rules and no save option.
In 2005 there was a commercial special edition distributed which features only the official rules.
