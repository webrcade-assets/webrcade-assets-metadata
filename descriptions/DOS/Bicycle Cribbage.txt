Bicycle Cribbage is a single-player, mouse-controlled implementation of the classic card game in which the player plays against the computer. Aside from the standard game this version also has Duplicate Cribbage and Losing Cribbage options together with a save-game function.
As standard protocols seem to have been observed including cutting the deck to decide which player has the first crib, shuffling between hands, one for his nob, the way markers are moved around the board etc.
The game has optional sound effects, bleeps for warnings and error messages, and a sort of slow machine-gun effect as the markers move around the board. There is no choice of card back and while the game keeps score it does not keep any form of history from one game to the next.
