This is a demo version of KKND that was published in 1997 on a number of gaming magazine cover disks. It includes two missions, one for each side, which are not featured in the retail game. Both missions allow the player to sample a considerable portion of the sides' tech trees and try out diverse units and tactics. Full motion video mission briefings and musical tracks are identical to those found in the retail version.Each mission's sole objective is to build up a base, amass a force and completely destroy all enemy presence. The difficulty level is varied, as the Evolved mission is considered to be easy while the Survivors mission is more challenging. Saving and loading games is disabled in the demo. There is no multiplayer option either.
