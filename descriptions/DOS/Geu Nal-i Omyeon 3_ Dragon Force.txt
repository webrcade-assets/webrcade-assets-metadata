The Earth was plagued by a global war that lasted twenty years. The invention of the Arcadia Bomb led to an uneasy peace. Shortly afterwards, a warrior race known as Lelia expressed their interest in the bomb and attacked the weakened humanity. Only the most skillful pilot can protect the planet and defeat the enemy.Dragon Force: Day 3 is a Korean-made side-scrolling shoot-em-up. The player can select to control any of the three characters: Jeong Kihyeop in his balanced fighter craft Taemiru; Jennifer Lee and the well-protected, but slow Black Cat; and Siegfried Reutz in his powerful, but fragile Gladiator. The player also chooses the shape of the future "options" (firepower-enhancing circles) for the craft - surrounding or attached to the tail. Each ship can collect up to four weapons, and the player can switch between them at will. Letter-shaped upgrades appear in the stages or are dropped by enemies. The game uses pseudo-3D scrolling, allowing enemies to appear from fore- and background.
