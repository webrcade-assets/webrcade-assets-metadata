Routes around the maze are blocked by boulders and pathways are patrolled by enemies - any contact with one of them costs a life. The wizard has a number of sizzling cauldrons at his disposal, these are actually a bombs which do not detonate immediately giving him time to move out of range. Using these bombs carefully the player can clear boulders thus gaining access to the full maze and the patrolling enemies. Sometimes, when a boulder has been destroyed a gem is left behind which either increases the number of spells at the player's disposal or the range of the next blast. Once all enemies have been killed a portal appears within the maze taking the player to the next level.
