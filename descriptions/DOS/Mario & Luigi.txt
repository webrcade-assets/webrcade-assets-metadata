Mario & Luigi is an unofficial DOS remake of Super Mario Bros.
Just like in the original game, it features Mario the plumber, jumping around, collecting pickups and defeating enemies across Mushroom Kingdom. Mario can find a mushroom which makes him grow, and a fire flower that allows him to shoot fireballs.
