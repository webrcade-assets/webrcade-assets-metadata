Samar is an educational program, divided into three parts: periodic table of elements, game Chemuk, game Symboch.Chemuk is a puzzle-arcade game that teaches the construction of chemical compounds. It consists in arranging the correct structural formula of a chemical compound from atoms and chemical bonds. Atoms and chemical bonds can only be pushed, which is hindered by stones, broken bulldozers and walls. Sometimes it is necessary to blow up a fragment of the wall to complete the chemical formula.Symboch.is all about finding a way out of a maze. At every corner of the maze there is a chemistry question and only the right answer gives you a passage to another part of the labyrinth.
