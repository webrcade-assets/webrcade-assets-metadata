Pumpkins from all over the planet stole Earth's candles to their home planet. Now, as an axe yielding maniac, you must destroy them and collect the candles back.This is a simple 2D action game where you must travel through mazes, kill pumpkins and collect candles. Its fame comes from a newsgroup running joke about a (at the time non-existing) game that would be a Doom killer, but could not generate enough hype due to its horrible sounding name. Reportedly, the developers wrote it in 48 hours to capitalize on the joke.
