Astrorock is an Asteroids variant with rock music: the player controls a spaceship that can turn and use a thruster to move forward. The objective is to shoot asteroids, which split into smaller fragments when hit, to earn points. Several additions differentiate it from the original: the screen scrolls, there are five enemy types with distinct behaviors, and five power-ups enhance the shipâ€™s weaponry (e.g., improved standard shots or saw blades) and defenses. The player can also use a limited shield to avoid damage. The goal is to score as many points as possible for the high-score list before losing all three lives. After a certain time, the player receives a detailed score analysis (including bonus points for feats like killing everything) and the next level with a higher difficulty starts. When starting a new game, the player can choose from all previously reached game levels.
