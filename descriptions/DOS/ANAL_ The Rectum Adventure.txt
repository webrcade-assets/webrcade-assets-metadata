ANAL: The Rectum Adventure is a textmode proof-of-concept inspired by R-Type and countless side-scrolling space shooters of its ilk. The game puts the player in control of a small triangular ship against a scrolling starfield and amidst a thronging swarm of stupid but dangerous green happy faces, which will cause the player to lose one life upon contact. The ship is equipped with infinite ammunition (fortunately, as there are similarly infinite amounts of enemies) and it can maneuvre around tight spots with the arrow keys if for whatever reason the player chooses to take a break from the itchy trigger finger.
Points are awarded upon shooting enemies; there is no goal save achieving a high score, and then beating that score.
