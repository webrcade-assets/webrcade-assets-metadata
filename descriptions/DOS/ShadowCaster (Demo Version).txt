The demo version of ShadowCaster includes a short scenario that is not part of the retail version release. The player controls the protagonist Kirt, who at the start of the demo receives a cryptic objective to "restore the crown of [an obelisk's] brother-in-flames to establish [his] heritage". This involves travelling from one obelisk to another at the end of the demo in a mostly linear fashion through several differently themed areas (open, underwater, underground), showcasing a few of the game's monsters, traps and other mechanics. Three morphing forms are available that should help the player bypass the obstacles on their way. Saving and loading is not available in the demo.
