In Moraff's Stones you play a human who comes into one of the many taverns in Moraff's World and you are invited to join in a game of... Stones. Stones is a game where you trade precious/semiprecious stones around the table, trying to get the most valuable hand, or the most complete and valuable hand (you get a 100 silver piece bonus for the most complete and valuable hand). You continue playing until you are wiped out by cleverer opponents and don't have enough silver pieces to buy yourself back into the game.
