The sequel to Clonk adds a new game element to the concept. The classic action-oriented melee rounds are now part of a larger strategy part. Two to four players each get their own troops of Clonks, with which they set out to conquer towns and castles in a predefined or randomly generated hexagon map.
Whenever two troops of hostile players meet on a specific field of the game's map, the game switches to a combat round, in which both players take direct control over their Clonks to eliminate the opposite crew. Crew strength, landscape and weather depend on the actual situation in the strategy part.
Players also have to worry about taxes, diplomatics and the happiness of the population in their controlled territories.
