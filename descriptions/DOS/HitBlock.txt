HitBlock is a German-language Crillion variant with little deviation from the classic ruleset. The player controls a ball that bounces up and down on the playing field, which is filled with blocks of various colours. The ball can destroy blocks of the same colour as itself, and can change to a different colour if it touches a special block that is marked with a half-empty glass. There are also deadly blocks with skulls and crossbones, which the ball must avoid touching lest the level is restarted. Touching blocks with keys allows to open locked blocks, and there are also sliding blocks which look like 3.5" disks that cannot be destroyed, but will be pushed by the ball if touched by it.The player's objective is to clear all coloured blocks from the playing field in as little time as possible. While the ball bounces up and down automatically, the player can move it left and right to change its direction. Some levels require quite precise control of the ball's movement to avoid skull blocks or colour-changing blocks of the wrong colour. Upon completing a level, bonus points are added depending on the amount of time left on the bonus countdown timer.HitBlock was released as freeware by its developer. The game includes 40 levels and a built-in level editor. The levels may be played in any order.
