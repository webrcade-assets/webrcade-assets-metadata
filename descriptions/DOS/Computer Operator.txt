This BASIC game simulates the experience of running a large, multi-user mainframe system of its day.  As the operator, you first configure the system by choosing the memory size, the number of disk and tape drives, the maximum number of concurrent users, and the overall game speed.  These factors determine the difficulty of your job - which is to cope with user demands and keep the system running.  If too many problems pile up, the system crashes and you lose.
After the system is booted, users begin to log in and do their work; you monitor the system's status in real time, and carry out your maintenance tasks using text commands.  User jobs place demands on CPU time, on storage devices, and on the printer; you'll need to balance the load, repair failed equipment, bring devices offline and online as needed, and meet the users' storage requirements.   You can also force users offline, and even communicate back when they complain at you through the messaging system.
