You are Commander William T. Riker of the Federation Starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). When the allied Aquila station comes under attack by unknown aliens, it's up to you and the crew of the Enterprise to solve the mystery, by exploring a historic ruined civilization, navigating your way through space, consulting the ship's experts (real Star Trek actors in digitized form), conversing with various aliens, and beaming down to various planets. The game's interface features no typing, due to context-sensitive icons and buttons.
