Racer Jammer is a variation on Head-On : you drive your Racer clockwise around the five-lane circuit, and rack up points by collecting the dots. Problem is, you share the track with another car, the Jammer, which goes in the opposite direction and tries its best to crash into you. You can speed up and slow down as needed, and change lanes at the mid-points to evade the enemy. Any collision will end the game; the Jammer also has a nasty tendency to drop random junk piles at the crossing points, which are just as lethal for the careless driver.When all the dots are collected, you clear the level. The levels grow larger as you advance, with more dots to collect, and more junk dropped by the enemy car.
