Wraith is a game by prolific solo developer Dr. Dungeon. It uses the same engine as Ultizurk III, but it is not a part of the Ultizurk series.The story has a fairy tale like vibe to it, with a backstory about a beautiful mermaid queen and her lover, and an evil sorcerer who ruined them. The player starts out in a cave, not knowing how he got there, and is approached by a wraith who looks very similar to that ancient mermaid queen, talking to the player as if they were lovers. At her behest, the player ventures deeper and deeper into the dungeon and uncovers the story bit by bit.Unlike Dr. Dungeon's previous games, Wraith features full character creation. The player can choose their character's name, sex, and class. Available classes are fighter, druid, ranger, and paladin. The interface has also been majorly overhauled compared to Dr. Dungeon's earlier games: it is now fully mouse-driven with some optional keyboard hotkeys for certain actions. Combat is still a simple real-time affair: position the character next to an enemy and right click on it until it dies. There is no cooldown between hits, so the player can hit as quickly as their finger can hit the right mouse button. The dialog system has also been changed fundamentally: while Dr. Dungeon's earlier games used a keyword parser, Wraith has dialog trees instead. There are also plenty of new ways to interact with the environment, similarly to Ultima VII, like watering the ground to make flowers grow.
