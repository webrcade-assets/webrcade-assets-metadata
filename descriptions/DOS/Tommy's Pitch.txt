Briefly, the player who names the highest bid names trumps and plays the first card. in this game it is not the number of tricks that counts but the cards contained in the tricks that count, points are scored for winning tricks with the highest and lowest trumps, the jack of trumps and the highest total of cards where Ace counts four, King counts three, Queen counts two, Jack counts one and Ten counts ten. Game configuration options include:* Playing without an auction
