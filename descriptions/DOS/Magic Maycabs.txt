Magic Maycabs is based on the classic BBC Micro game Magic Mushrooms. However, the player controls a car in this recreated DOS version of the game. The small car needs to zoom around each level collecting every mushroom. Once all the mushrooms for the level have been found, an exit block leads to the next level.There are various enemies to avoid, some looking like crabs, spiders, and green monsters. They are relatively clever and will follow the car around. There is also a timer for each level just to add an extra challenge. Magic Maycabs also includes a level editor to create custom levels.
