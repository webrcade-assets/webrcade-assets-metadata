Albert Lasser's Clearing House is a simulation of the the equity market and the international trading floor. The player controls the owner of a young company who wants to enhance his private and business fortune.
To run his business the player has to switch between locations, e.g. office, banks or airport. In every location are different actions available, e.g. bribing informants, speaking to the secretary, raise a credit or read the economic articles in the newspaper. The game is played in real-time, that means a clock is always ticking in the upper right corner. Certain locations are only open at certain times, e.g. the pub opens at 5 p.m., so the player has to plan his actions ahead. Later the available locations are spread over the whole world.
The player can set the playing ability of the computer controlled opponents in three levels. It is possible to play against twelve AIs or with overall four human players.
