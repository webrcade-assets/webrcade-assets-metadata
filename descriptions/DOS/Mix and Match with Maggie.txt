The game is one of a series of educational titles from Scetlander, dedicated to children under 5 years: with the help of Maggie the Loch Ness monster as the host, they are to learn how to match different objects together.There are three major mini-game modes available: "Two of a Kind" (matching pictures, shapes, letters or numbers), "Odd One Out" (identifying the odd picture, shape, letter or number), "Forget-me-not" (pictures, shapes, letters or numbers are being 'flashed' on screen - after that the correct match has to be identified), as well as "Clock and Calendar" mode (which just displays the internal clock and calendar in either digital or analogue form).
