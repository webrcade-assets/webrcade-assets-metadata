Wings over Italy is a historical combat airplane simulation game that was created with Domark/Simis' Flight Sim Toolkit. The game covers the period in the history of Italy during World War II from the signing of the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 to the end of the war in May 1945.The player can fly missions for both the National Republican Air Force of the Italian Social Republic and the U.S. Army Air Forces. These include interception of enemy bombers or escort of friendly aircraft in a fighter plane, and attacking enemy ground targets with a bomber plane. Since the Flight Sim Toolkit only provided the binary/engine for actual flight simulations, the author included a custom DOS-based GUI launcher that allows to select missions, as well as view the supplied electronic documentation.Wings over Italy was marketed as shareware, with the registered version containing a more up-to-date programme with a larger number of missions available compared to the freely distributable shareware version.
