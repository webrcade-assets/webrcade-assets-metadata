V for        Victory: Market Garden takes the series to southern        Holland. As the British commander, you must take and hold        bridges across three major rivers, secure a foothold        across the Rhine, and open a corridor for the invasion of        Germany. As the German commander, you must delay the        British advance, destroy the airborne divisions, and        prevent the British army from reaching German territory.
