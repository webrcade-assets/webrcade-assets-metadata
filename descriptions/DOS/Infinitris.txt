Infinitris is a Tetris variant with optional non-standard pieces that are not tetrominoes, i.e. the number of blocks they are made of is greater or lesser than four. Other customisable options include the ability to adjust the size of the playing field, add randomly appearing bombs that can clear away blocks (similar to Super Tetris), switch to grayscale mode, and turn on special bouncing blocks. The player can select the starting difficulty level, and begin the game with up to ten random incomplete rows of blocks already on the playing field. Additionally, the game supports recordable replays of playing sessions.
Infinitris was marketed as shareware, with some of the above options disabled in the unregistered version.
