Brixor is a fast-playing brick-breaking game with SVGA graphics. The player controls a paddle that can move horizontally at the bottom of the screen, to direct a ball that bounces around the playing field and destroys any bricks/tiles that it hits. Unlike many other similar games, here every brick will release a round item called a bowl when destroyed, which will then bounce in the same way as the ball (but without breaking any further bricks) before eventually falling down and leaving the playing field. The player needs to shoot (not catch) these bowls to be able to sell them later in a shop between levels. Credits earned by breaking bricks and shooting down bowls can be spent in the same shop to purchase weapons and other useful powerups.
Another novelty is that the paddle slowly wears down from hits by the ball, the falling bowls, and from the use of powerups (like shooting guns). So unlike other brick-breaking games, the player is generally advised to avoid all items that fall from broken bricks, or shoot them if possible. The paddle's energy may be restored between levels, which also costs credits. There is an option to turn off powerup purchasing altogether, in this case the only objective of each level is to break all bricks, with no powerups or items to be collected during play.
Brixor was sold as shareware, with 15 levels available in the unregistered version. The full game has 150 levels and a level editor.
