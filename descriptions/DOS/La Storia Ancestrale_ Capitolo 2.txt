Second entry in the episodic video game adaptation of The Ancestral Trail fantasy novel periodical.The game follows the story of Richard in his quest for the six gems that, when brought to the Tree of Life, will restore balance in the world. After retrieving the first gem in La Storia Ancestrale - Capitolo 1 , Richard finds himself in a cursed city whose every inhabitant has been turned to stone. He must uncover the secret of the city and continue his pursuits of the gems.La Storia Ancestrale is a point-and-click adventure game on fixed screens from a two-dimensional side view. Left-clicking on an object or exit causes Richard to walk there, right-clicking will have him look at the object, whereas left-clicking while holding the right button will perform a default action such as pick up or talk. There is a single "use" verb for objects in the inventory, which varies in effect depending on Richard's location. Occasionally, Richard will have to fight monsters in an arcade sequence with a crossbow.
