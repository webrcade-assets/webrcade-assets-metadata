The little Pixy 2 is a non-violent puzzle platform game with a Christmas theme. The Pixy is one of Santa's elves. Everyone else in the workshop has caught a cold, so he needs to collect all presents into Santa's sack for delivery to children all over the world.
The game has nine levels, each containing four presents, while the Pixy can only carry one at a time. Some areas of the workshop must be unlocked after finding a key. The challenge comes from the time limit, which is fairly tight and requires careful planning to devise the optimal route through every level (which often involves backtracking) before the countdown timer reaches zero. There are no save games or level passwords, and the player has only three lives.
The little Pixy 2 was developed with Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.5 and Assembler 6.1 and released as freeware. According to the readme, the authors aimed to create a game of SNES quality. It features pre-rendered and hand-drawn art, animated intro sequence, background music and sound effects.
