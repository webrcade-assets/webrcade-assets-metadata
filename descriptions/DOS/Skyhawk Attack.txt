Skyhawk Attack is a military aircraft flight simulator that was created with Domark and Simis' Flight Sim Toolkit (FST) construction set. It is in many ways similar to another game by the same author, Tornado Squadron. The premise is that it's the early 1960s, and the player is a Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot of a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk assigned to a remote base which is located on a fictitious group of islands, constantly under threat from bellicose neighbours. The campaign to defend the islands is comprised of various missions that range form pushing back an enemy air attack, destroying various targets, escort assignments etc.The game comes with a simple graphical front-end that allows to select scenarios to play. There is a total of fourteen missions, which may be completed in any order. Action can take place at dawn, noon or nighttime. Some missions start on the runway while others in mid-flight. The FST engine allows for basic navigation via beacons that show the general direction of major sites and installations on the map relative to the player's position, with beacon frequencies described in the game manual. But other than that, the game encourages a more or less sandbox approach, with the player free to fly around and try out different things.Skyhawk Attack was released as freeware by its author.
