Lomax Boulders II is the sequel to Lomax Boulders. The protagonist Logan Maxwell (represented by a heart symbol on the playing field for some reason), having solved all 50 puzzles from the original game, finds another 50 caverns filled with diamonds and various hazards. Gameplay mechanics remain the same: you need to collect a specified number of diamonds to unlock the exit. There are monsters (identified as robbers and guards by the game manual; but some look like birds) that will chase Lomax and may be disposed of by dropping boulders or diamonds on them, and slime that slowly expands over the level. Once it reaches a certain size it causes an avalanche of boulders in the level.
