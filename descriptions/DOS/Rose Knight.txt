Rose Knight is a "raising simulation" very similar to Princess Maker games. The player assumes the role of a knight who has retired from the battlefield and wishes to raise his daughter as a worthy successor to his heroic deeds.Most of the game is spent selecting schedules for the young girl and watching how her attributes change accordingly. Studying, training, and working occupy the majority of activities. The player can opt to praise or reprimand the young lady, which also affects her statistics.It is possible to buy weapons and armor as well as participate in battles. However, unlike Princess Maker games, there is no exploration and no true RPG-style character development: like other events, battles occur randomly in the end of a chapter.
