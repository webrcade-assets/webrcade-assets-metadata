In Tink!Tonk!: Tonk in the Lane of Buddy-Bots a Buddy-Bot has become broken to pieces, and it calls upon Tink!Tonk! to find the pieces and reconstruct it. Played from a top down perspective, the player must explore the multiple screens of the land to gather all the robot pieces. The player must avoid dangers including roving Gorks and holes, which send the player to the dungeons of King Gork's castle. If the player falls through a hole in the dungeon or encounters King Gork, they are sent home, and must restart the game. Scattered throughout the land are caves, which contain mini-games that must be completed for robot parts. The player must gather all 12 robot pieces to return home successfully.
There are four difficulty levels, which effects the challenge of mini-games. It contains six separate mini-games, which can be played separately or as a part of Tink!Tink!'s larger adventure.
