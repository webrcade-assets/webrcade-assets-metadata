In this Christian adventure game, you assume the role of Moses, who must free his people, the Israelites, from slavery in Egypt.  A text adventure, with optional graphics.  Follows the book of Exodus very closely, and the "hint" feature usually directs you to read a particular passage.  The game itself is quite short and relatively easy, with much of the important parts of the story presented as several screens of non-interactive text.  Many of the early "puzzles" involve addressing places or people by name.  Unintentionally funny at times.
