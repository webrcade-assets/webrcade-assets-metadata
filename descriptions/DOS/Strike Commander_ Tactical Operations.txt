The Turkish Government has had enough of mercenaries using their country as a base for their operations and have raised taxes to force them out. Your squadron is once again in danger of bankruptcy and you must fly more missions to bring in the money to keep them afloat.
This was an add-on for Strike commander which added another 21 missions, some new planes and General MIDI support to the original game.
