PC Pillbox is an artillery game for two players. The number of battles is set in advance, and the terrain is randomly generated for each round of hostilities. Players are placed on opposite sides of the screen, and proceed to take turns happily blasting the pulp out of each other with missiles, until only one remains standing. Shots are aimed by entering the muzzle velocity and the turret's angle; an accurate hit will send the target to kingdom come in a big, red fireball. Stats for both players are shown at the end of the game.
