A fairly standard word-search puzzle game: find and mark the words concealed inside a grid full of scrambled letters.  The game doesn't come with a predefined list of words, but the player is free to create one, after which the computer constructs the puzzle - placing each word horizontally, vertically or diagonally, in normal or reverse order. Parameters such as grid size can be redefined.You have the option to reveal the hidden words when the going gets tough; if you're hell-bent for hard-copies, the puzzle (and its solution) can be printed too.
