This textmode BBS door game (with local play) allows the player to tool a boat around various bodies of freshwater with the arrow keys and see what comes up when the fishing line is cast into the blue deep, after situating near the desired water depth and bottom conditions and selecting an appropriate type and size of lure and line retrieval speed. Elements of strategy come into play when deciding whether to give a struggling fish slack or not, while the calm fisherman must have quick twitch reflexes to capitalise on a fish's idle nibble.
The game, permitting tournament competitions as well as idle one-off forays to the lake, keeps extensive track of records -- which species caught where, of what size, and allows players to compare their performance to that of those who came before.
