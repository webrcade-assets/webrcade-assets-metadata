3-D space shooter a la Wing Commander but on shareware. The full game consists of the demo mission which was released of shareware with nine single player missions, and modem & LAN options available to registered players.
You are space fighter pilot and have to complete 10 scenarios (with 10 goals each) of missions that range from asteroid blasting, to pirate elimination, patrols, escorting ships, etc. The back story has the player posted to a remote outpost in the Deneb start system after getting their pilots licence. The only other pilots are an old cyborg and the starbase captain but then none seem needed since there has been no activity in this sector for a long, long time. All this changes when, on your watch, an asteroid storm appears and is headed for the base....
The game uses a polygon-based engine, with graphics that put the emphasis on line-drawing and very radical lightsourcing as a way to convey the lack of visibility on space thanks to pockets of darkness created by asteroids, etc. This makes for less dogfighting and more hunting-like action as the main gameplay objective.
