Super Speed is a fixed-screen top-down arcade racer in the style of Atari's 1986 arcade game Super Sprint. The player gets to compete against three human or computer opponents around tracks laden with obstacles like puddles, whirlwinds, and skulls. Wrenches can be collected to instantly enhance the car with things like faster acceleration, higher top speed, and greater traction.The game was distributed for free as shareware with the full features and three tracks. The commercial Deluxe version comes with six tracks in total as well as three secret bonus levels. The game could be ordered as a mail order worldwide to Tom Fresen directly in Germany, or in the US and Canada through the publisher The Game Factory.
