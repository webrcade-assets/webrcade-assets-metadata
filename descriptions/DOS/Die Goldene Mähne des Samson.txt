Die Goldene MÃ¤hne des Samson is a German point&click type adventure game with graphics and selectable dialog line choices.
The game starts with you being a passenger on an aircraft flying over a desert, while you are filling out a form, entering your characters name and sex.
You then have an introductory dialog/banter with a passenger of the opposite sex, who is an archaeologist, until your captain staggers out of the cockpit, completely drunk. After a successful crash landing, you have to find your way out of the aircraft and proceed to the nearest town, which just happens to be the ancient Petra.
The story is split into three parts of very mixed up legends:
The first part requires you to explore a hidden temple in Petra, and you are required to find the lost Fleece of Samson, who for some reason is described as an Egyptian Pharaoh.
The second part puts you in a more North American Indian setting, with the objective of building a 'Medicine Wheel', involving animal deities like 'The Great Eagle'.
The third part puts you in an East Indian setting, involving the Vishu, Shambu, Hara and Shiva deities.
Winning the full game and getting the golden fleece lets you out of the temple into a Maharajah's palace where you presumably can enjoy the spoils and treasures you collected.
The game is sponsored by a German tobacco brand 'Samson', and their products are mentioned and shown in the game.
It is in three parts, the first being distributed as shareware, while the full game was available by mail order.
