Acquire is adapted from the board game of the same name. Up to six players can take part and each starts with $6,000, the object is to buy and sell shares in hotels with the winner being the player who makes the most money. The game is played via the keyboard and gameplay is described pretty well under another version of the game
Computer Acquire. This version of the game ends either when any chain gets larger then forty tiles, or the last tile has been drawn, or when the players quit the game.
