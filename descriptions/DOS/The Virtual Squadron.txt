The Virtual Squadron: Thunderbirds Past, Present and Future! is an unofficial add-on forMicrosoft Flight Simulator (v5.0) and Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95. It gives the player all the aircraft flown by the US Thunderbirds air demonstration squadron at the time of its release, together with their USAF equivalents, and a host of bonus aircraft. At the time this add-on was released the F-22 Lightning was not in service as congressional funding was needed before it could go into production and be deployed, hence the 'Future' element in the title.All the Thunderbird/USAF aircraft can be installed all at once or individually if required, while the bonus aircraft can be installed in single groups or collectively.The Thunderbird aircraft available in this compilation are:F-100D Super Sabre in USAF and Thunderbird liveryF-105D Thunderchief in USAF camouflage livery and the F-105B Thunderchief in Thunderbird liveryF-16 Fighting Falcon in USAF and Thunderbird liveryF-22 Lightning II in YF22 and Thunderbird liveryF-4D Phantom II in USAF camouflage and the F-4E Phantom II in Thunderbird liveryF-84F Thunderstreak in USAF and Thunderbird liveryF-84G Thunderjet in USAF and Thunderbird liveryT-38 Talon in both USAF chase plane and Thunderbird liveryIn addition to the Thunderbird aircraft the package includes fifty additional aircraft.
