The year is 2360. Androids killed all the humanity on planet Earth and now they plan to destroy all the vegetation, too, using an element called Cybertrone. The only survivors are a small group of scientists hidden on the planetoid base Matna Plus. Scientists learn that Cybertrone was used before by extinct civilization from the planet Ascus.
This civilization also developed a counter-device against Cybertrone, called Sodomgomorhator. This device is located on the second moon of the planet Ascus, called Quadam. The scientists sent out the best men to retrieve the device, but they soon lost contact with the team. Several weeks later they send their last ship with only person on board, the explorer David, who is the last chance for Earth. Does he survive the hostile environment of the moon, find the lost expedition and successfully retrieve the artifact?
Mission Quadam is a sci-fi point-and-click adventure based around exploration, conversations and puzzles. It has a large amount of pixel-hunting elements. The team explores the environment and has access to an inventory at the bottom of the screen. Everything is controlled through the mouse with a single action.
