StarMines is a top-down, single-screen shooter that is a variant of Omega Race. The player controls a spaceship and is tasked with shooting down a number of mines that move over the play field. The controls allow for steering left and right, engaging the thrust and firing a laser cannon. Momentum is preserved, so slowing down or stopping is only possible by reversing course and then engaging the thrust again. When hitting the edges of the screen or a box in the center that displays level and score, the ship will bounce off. Destroying all mines advances into the next wave. When not hit fast enough, mines can reproduce themselves.
