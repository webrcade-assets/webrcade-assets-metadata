Escape del Castillo de la Física (meaning Escape from the Castle of Physics) is a Spanish-language adventure game from Cuba.
Nekkrom, an evil scientist, kidnapped a woman named Sarah in his castle. What he asks for releasing her is to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. But that won't happen, so it's your job to enter the castle and rescue Sarah. Gameplay involves solving physics-based puzzles inside the castle, in classic first-person, point-and-click adventure style. You also have an inventory, and an assistant called Doctor Martínez, who is a talking energy being trapped inside a glass jar (he was a man before, but Nekkrom turned him into that) whom you can talk to to know more about the story and about physics.
