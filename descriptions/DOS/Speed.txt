This is an interactive movie straight from the IMAX movie "Speed".  The film is about the never-ending quest that humans have to go faster.  It starts out in prehistoric times, when all humans speed was restricted to how fast they could run.  Other inventions appear and evolve, like the wheel making way to the chariot, which made way to the automobile, which made way to the high-performance sports car of today.  The Wright brother flier made way for the biplane, which eventually made way for the jet airplane.  The film ends with this message: how fast will humans go in the future?
The whole package includes an interactive encyclopedia, a roller coaster simulation, a simulation featuring the comparison of the speeds of various animals and vehicles, and three educational games.
