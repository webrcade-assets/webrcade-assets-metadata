Larisa Oleynik (teen actress from The Secret World of Alex Mack) has gotten herself trapped in a hellish ASCII chemical factory, alternatingly filled with gapped walls and seven rooms between them containing moving spikes. As dashing Hunter Reeves (character from the same show, played by Will Estes), it is your job to maneuvre with arrow key presses through the gaps in the walls while avoiding the thrusting spikes, in hopes of reaching the bottom of the screen and retrieving Larisa... then to bring her back to the top and glorious freedom!
