In Geekwad: Games of the Galaxy the player takes control of the Geekwad Gamer, the best gamer in the universe. To win the game one has to free a king by getting the high score at five video games and trivia. All the games are parodies of classic arcade games like Spaced Solicitors ( Space Invaders), Beefender ( Defender), Phlegming (the name is like Lemmings but gameplay is closer to Joust), Grogger ( Frogger), and more.
