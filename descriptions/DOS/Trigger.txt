Crazy Park is a place not recommended for people who want to have a peaceful existence, because the murderers, thieves and other thugs converted it into their home. But of course, as in every other story where some bad guys take a place which doesn't belong to them, there will appear a guy ready to end them.
Trigger is a first-person view game where you have to make use of your Gun Stick accessory. The game has a side-scroll by which you will see a multitude of enemies emerging. Some of them will shot at you, others will launch grenades, knives...there will even be exhibitionists. But don't go too fast, there will be other persons at which you should not shoot, otherwise points will be reduced from your marker. Also, there will appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.
