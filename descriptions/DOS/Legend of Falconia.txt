Legend of Falconia is a fantasy adventure game for the Amiga and MS-DOS, in German and English. The interface is a hybrid of both text adventures and graphic adventures: you can type in commands and see a text description of where you are and what you're doing, but there is also mouse control with a LucasArts-style action bar, and graphics showing your location.The game begins at an old, run-down house, isolated on the edge of a forest, on modern-day Earth. You take on the role of an estate agent working for a firm that plans to buy up the house from its current owners, then knock it down and build a supermarket on the land. The firm already sent out one agent for this deal, but they disappeared without a trace. As you approach the house, it seems deserted and empty, but as you start looking around it soon becomes clear that there is more going on at this place than it seems...
