Pro Golf Challenge is a 1 - 4 player golf simulation for multiple systems.Built using the same engine as Hi-Res Computer Golf , Pro Golf Challenge represents a later release of this game.The game features true-to-scale fairway design, often requiring two to three screens to display. There are wind factors, 8 clubs to choose from, and fairway obstacles including: sand traps, roughs, water traps, and groves of trees. There are different contoured greens, which require modification of play to improve putting. Game contains a practice mode, beginners course, and several more challenging courses.The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the golfer must choose their direction, club and type of swing for each round. When the player tees off, they need to control their club throughout the arc of the swing. If they do not come in contact with the ball, they lose their swing. The efficiency of each shot is based upon how well the player swings, and how solidly they contact the ball.
