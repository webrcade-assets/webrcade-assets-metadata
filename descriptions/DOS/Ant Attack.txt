Just as the picnic baskets have been laid out, hordes of gigantic ants start swarming in from the anthills all around.  Your job is simple - exterminate!  Move quickly through the playfield and dispose of the vermin, before they become too much to deal with.Armed with a bulldozer (to flatten those anthills), a bucket of water (ants can't swim), and an unlimited supply of particularly potent ant spray, you must protect the picnic baskets at all costs.  The ant colonies will spread if not dealt with quickly, and if all the baskets are devoured, it's all over.The shareware release features 10 levels, out of 100 in the complete version.
