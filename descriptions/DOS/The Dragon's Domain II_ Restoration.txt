It has been decades since you returned the magic chalice in The Dragon's Domain. But the dragons have returned. This time, your goal is to retrieve the three eggs that the dragons have laid, so that they can be raised into good dragons. Unfortunately, the eggs are hidden in mazes, five to be precise, with locked doors and dangers throughout.
The Dragon's Domain II: Restoration is an action game heavily influenced by Adventure. As in that game, you explore a maze of screens to find keys, and fight dragons and other monsters.
The game was distributed as freeware, but with a request for donations.
