Phantomas PC is an unofficial enhanced remake of the 1986 ZX Spectrum game Phantomas. It keeps the original game and level design entirely intact, but replaces the visuals and the music with a modern variant. The player controls the robot thief Phantomas who infiltrates the mansion of Goldter to steal his safe box and treasure chest. The game consists of several single-screen rooms linked together both horizontally and vertically using a flip-screen mechanic, offering some freedom for exploration. To win the game all switches first need to be located and flipped as only then the safe will be opened. After grabbing the treasure Phantomas then needs to run for the exit.As the character has no means to attack he has to dodge enemies and hazards. Colliding with them drains a health meter. Every now and then glowing energy capsules can be picked up to restore some energy. Most of the gameplay centers around careful platform navigation, timing jumps with many moving blocks. The game keeps track of the overall progress and has a high score table.
