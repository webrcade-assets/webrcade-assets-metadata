Composed of no more than 256 bytes of machine code, Formula-1 TURBO is a straightforward, vertically-scrolling racer: the player's car zooms along at a constant speed and can be steered left and right to keep from crashing. This can be achieved by avoiding two things - the sides of the road, and other cars; the latter are quite content to sit still in the middle of the track, indifferent to the prospect of being rear-ended.To complicate matters, the winding race track zig-zags left and right and grows progressively narrower, so that the difficulty ramps up as the game goes on. Scoring increases with time, starting with "A" and progressing through consecutive letters - a longer survival ensures a place further along the alphabet.
