The Pyramids Of Mars is a single player, keyboard controlled text adventure based on story from the BBC TV series Doctor Who which was serialised in 1975.
Both the televised program and the game start with the TARDIS heading to Earth and the year 1975 but being dragged off course and landing in an English country house in 1911. The house belongs to an Egyptologist, Professor Marcus Scarman. Marcus discovered the tomb of Sutekh the last of a race of powerful beings knows as the Osirans. Though imprisoned n the tomb by The Eye Of Horus, which is housed in the eponymous pyramids, Sutekh is mentally very powerful, powerful enough to divert the TARDIS, and seeks to escape his prison.
The game has one hundred and nine locations and a perfect score would be one hundred and five points.
