Smashout is a Breakout clone written for IBM PCs with monochrome displays. In genre-typical fashion, the goal here is to dismantle a wall of bricks by chipping away at it with a ball. Your paddle deflects the ball, and controls its trajectory by striking it at different angles; you start out with five balls, and lose one if it falls through the bottom of the screen.You get your points for knocking down bricks: the brighter their color, the more they're worth. Since the game runs in 80-column text mode, and each brick is a single character cell, there are considerably more bricks to destroy than in most Breakout variants. Another quirk is in the controls: the paddle moves one step at a time, using different keys for smaller and larger steps.
