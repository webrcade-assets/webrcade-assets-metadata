The computer is thinking of one of 5462 words, and you get to guess it, one letter at a time. One to five players get so many incorrect guesses (of letters not contained in the unknown word) before the game "kills" them and moves on to a new word. Meanwhile, for every incorrect guess, a portion of a scaffold is erected menacingly on your screen. This is an implementation of that simple game known as "hangman", but computerized, and en Fran√ßais.
