MicroLink Yaht is a computerized version of the classic dice game that Milton Bradley has popularized as Yahtzee. Players roll five dice trying to get certain combinations for their scorecard. They may reroll any of the five dice twice after the first roll or choose to stop rolling at any point before that. Deciding where to put a score can be just as important as actually rolling a certain combination. If a player rolls particularly well, they can get bonus points.The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of ANSI characters, which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.
