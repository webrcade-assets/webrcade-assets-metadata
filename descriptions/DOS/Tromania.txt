Tromania is a 2-player light-cycle game, with inspiration from the movie TRON. Two drivers are set in an enclosed arena, riding their light-cycles at either constant or turbo speed, while leaving wall-like tracks behind them as obstacles, without hitting each others walls/tracks or the arena boundary, in which case the cycle has crashed and the player has lost the game.
The game can be played against the computer, or against another human, on a shared screen & keyboard.
Controls are keyboard only, and the screen is split in three main parts, each player has frontal view display on left/right side of the screen, and there is a common top-down view of the game area between and below them, showing the cycles tracks as green and red lines, to avoid. Hitting the border of the game area, or any of the laid out tracks ends the ride for that player, and a noise screen is shown in the losing players viewing field. Each player has one light cycle with four turbo charges, and the game continues until one of the players light-cycle has crashed.
