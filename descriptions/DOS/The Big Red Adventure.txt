The Big Red Adventure is a sequel to Nippon Safes Inc.. This time the action takes place in Russia after Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika. The player again takes the role of Doug Nuts, Dino Fagioli and Donna Fatale and accidentally become embroiled in a plot to restore communism. As a typical point'n'click adventure, you move your character over hand-drawn backgrounds, making actions on objects from your inventory with scenery elements or giving them to different people. The story is split into four parts. The first two parts are initially disconnected from themselves. In each of them you control one of the characters performing different objectives just to let it end on board of the train when all three characters meet again. This is where the game becomes more complicated because the player has to make them cooperate by sharing the objects or information.
