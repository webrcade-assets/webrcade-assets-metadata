Stuiter (Dutch for bounce) is a game with a playing field full of dots. On this field there's a snake eating those dots. When the snake hits one of the walls, he bounces off in a different direction. The player can change these walls and thus alter the path of the snake. There's also a monster that moves in the same way as the snake. When the snake and the monster hit each other 5 times, the game ends. The objective of the game is to let the snake eat as many dots as possible.
