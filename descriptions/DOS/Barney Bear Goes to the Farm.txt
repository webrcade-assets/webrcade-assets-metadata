Barney Bear Goes to the Farm is an educational game designed for children aged three to eight. It follows a day in the life of Barney Bear, an anthropomorphic bear cub. The first part of the game is a storybook that depicts Barney doing his chores. Narrated by a text-to-speech voice without subtitles, this section features minimal interactivity, requiring players to click on the correct spot to advance the story, usually a “next” button. Occasionally, clicking on other items or characters triggers additional narration or animations.
In the evening, Barney and his grandparents gather in the living room, where players can choose from six activities. This section can also be accessed directly from the title screen:

Two narrated educational short stories ( The Seed and Healthy Bears) and 10 unnarrated short stories about various animals, featuring very simple sentences.
What Belongs to Me? : Players are shown a picture of an animal and must select the corresponding item from six options.
The Silly Scarecrow : Players build a scarecrow by choosing its head, body, and legs.
A picture book.
