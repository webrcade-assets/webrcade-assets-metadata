Heather's Easter Egg Hunt is a text adventure intended for children. You play the role of Heather, a young girl on a mission to find all the brightly-colored easter eggs hidden in her home. To win the game, you will also need to find a secret door, that only opens once you have all the eggs. Some parts of the house are locked off, so you will need to find the corresponding key before you can explore further. The keys and locks are color-coded: you will need a red key for a red lock, and so on. Heather's younger brother Alan will occasionally cause trouble, and you will need to help placate him. There is no limit to the number of items you can carry at once. The in-game instructions include a map of the house layout.
