Harp is a young fairy of the Butterfly tribe. One day she and her friends meet an old man from another tribe, and Harp draws the ire of the villagers for helping him. Eventually the authorities decide to expel her. Shortly thereafter Harp finds out that the Hornet tribe attacked her home village and captured its inhabitants. In spite of their unfair behavior towards her, the kind fairy embarks on a journey to rescue her tribesmen.
Harp is a Korean-made isometric monochrome adventure game with fairly simple gameplay mechanics. The playing area is confined to a small screen that looks like an illustration in a book; the rest of the "page" is occupied by text and small portraits or scenes depicting the events of the game. The player moves Harp through the game world and advances the plot by visiting different locations and talking to people. There is no inventory, puzzles, or any other kind of challenge in the game.
