Clash is a turn-based strategy modeled on the Heroes of Might and Magic and Warlords series. The plot is based on the legend of the ancient land of Karkhan, attacked by wild tribes. The goal is to develop and maintain their lands constantly attacked by the occupying invaders.
There are 30 different types of units. They can be allocated to defend the city, set patrols and discover new areas of the map. Addition to typical military units are builders, which are used for all types of construction and mining work. An important element is the extension of the economy and castles. In castles the player can place the new building, increasing population and its manufacturing capacity. There are also elements of diplomacy.
The game takes place during three seasons: summer, autumn and winter. Up to five players can participate in the missions simultaneously. Soldiers have their own tiredness levels. An exhausted soldier requires rest and, in extreme cases, may rebel.
