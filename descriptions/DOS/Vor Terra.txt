In Vor Terra the player takes on the role of a Knight, who is attempting to restore order to his land and become its ruler,
 after the old King died and the kingdom turned into a wasteland in chaos, it's inhabitants now suffering from plagues, thieves and monsters.
In order to accomplish this the knight must search the land for a 'Rainbow Egg', that has been prophesized to be the key to restoring peace.
Traveling through the land while fighting enemies, talking to people for hints of the fabled egg's location and searching; 'leaving no tombstone unturned', will hopefully help you get you the throne and be King if you succeed. (Or at least a rainbow omelet.)
The games design is similar to the authors earlier game Shape Shifter, only now with a human protagonist.
