A 9KB remake of Asteroids : your ship is confined to a wrap-around sector of space, and your job is to survive the onslaught of incoming space rocks by pulverizing them into smaller and smaller bits. The ship is maneuvered by rotating and thrusting - this adaptation simulates some friction, so there's no endless inertial movement; you can also thrust in reverse. The green bar at the bottom indicates the status of your shields, which get drained by collisions and by your continuous-fire weapon, which makes it important to conserve energy. When the shields are completely down, your ship will crumple at the slightest touch; fortunately, the smallest asteroids drop green energy balls when destroyed, and picking them up will recharge the shields.
