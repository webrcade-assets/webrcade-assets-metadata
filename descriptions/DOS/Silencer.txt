Silencer is an action game, where The Silencer needs to silence all creatures in each level by crushing them between two blocks. There are three different main types of blocks: movable, unmovable, and explosive (do not touch). Any number of movable blocks can be pushed, but only in four directions; movement is in eight. A single block at a time can also be pulled. There are fifteen (randomly-generated) levels, with each level being faster with more enemies than the last.There are seven different types of enemy. The Predator just tries to move towards The Silencer. The Imitator will hide itself as a block. The Replicator can replicate itself. The Beeliner will attempt to move away from The Silencer rather rapidly. The Detonator can destroy nearby blocks. The Degenerator can move blocks, and can only be destroyed by tricking it into moving an explosive block. The Paragon cannot be destroyed, but will eventually create a nest and turn into eight Predators.The game supports 1â€“4 players; play cycles to the next player on death. It also supports three difficulty levels, and a per-level time limit. The game was distributed as Shareware, without any missing features.
