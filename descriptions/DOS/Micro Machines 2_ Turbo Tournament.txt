Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament is the second game in the Micro Machines series. Like its predecessor, it puts the player behind the steering wheel of an extremely small car. The races take place in locations such as a table, a treehouse, and many more.
The CD-ROM version adds CD-audio music while the Mega Drive (Genesis) version features a special cartridge that allows players to connect two additional controllers to the console for four-player games.
The DOS version comes with a construction kit/track editor. The floppy version has three tracks included and the CD version five.
The number of tracks vary depending on the version of the game. The Game Gear and Game Boy version have around 37 tracks, and the DOS SNES, and Genesis version have around 50. The handheld versions also only have 12 drivable vehicles instead of the standard 17.
