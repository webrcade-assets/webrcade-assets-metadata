Campaign is a two-player turn-based strategic game with cavalry, guns and infantry units.
The players troops are placed at either end of a top-town square-grid map, with roads, woods, rivers and bridges or rafts to cross them. The players units are foot-soldiers, cavalry, artillery and a captain who is the main objective for elimination. All battles are resolved by dice-throws. Cannons can destroy bridges and walls using a six-throw. The captain can repair bridges and walls if needed, using a six-throw. There are also randomly placed mines on the map, that can kill moving troops.
Initially the troops are grouped together behind protective walls, and four 6-sided dice are used to deploy individual units along strategic points on the map. Each unit has a different reach for movement or battle, also depending on terrain, and you select one of your thrown dice to move/fight with each troop. Sometimes the troops get blocked by walls, path-finding is not one of their good skills. Rafting is a short downstream transport for anyone climbing aboard.
Once in reach of each other the troops can do battle with various effects; e.g. a cavalry unit losing its battle is unhorsed, and will turn into an infantry unit. A fully eliminated unit is replaced by a tombstone. When the captain from one army is eliminated, by an enemy unit standing next to it and attacking, the game is over.
The manual states more maps available for the registered game, but the unregistered 'sampler' game has only one scenario. There is no computer AI to play against, so it can only be played with human opponents.
