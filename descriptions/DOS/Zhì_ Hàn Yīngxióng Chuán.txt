Zhì: Hàn Yīngxióng Chuán is a 3rd-person action game set during the Han period. It is based on the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the six playable characters are characters from said novel: four of the five tiger generals (Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Zhao Yun), Zhuge Liang and Guan Yinping. Each of them has different statistics: hit points, defense, magic, attack and dexterity.To progress through the game, the player moves through the levels, searches for keys to open doors and kills a lot of enemies. This is either done by using the standard weapon (besides one character with a crossbow, they all use blades) or one of six magic spells. Those allow to attack from a distance and, depending on their potency, use a different amount of magic points. Collected items, e.g. items which replenish magic and health points, go into an inventory. From there, they can be selected and used.
