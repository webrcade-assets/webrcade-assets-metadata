Ant Attack PC is a remake of the game Ant Attack for the PC platform. It tries to be faithful to the original so it is keyboard controlled, has basic sound effects and the same story/game play.Release Zero (2000) runs in DOS or in a DOS window while the latest release, v0.02.001 (2006) is Windows only and has been renamed 3D Ant Attack PC. Both versions do, however, allow some customisation such as changing the number of ants to be dealt with. The later version also has a city editor and save/load functionality.
