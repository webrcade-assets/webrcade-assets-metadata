Undercover and fresh out of prison, you, Sam Frost, are hired by the corporate giant, Metacorp, to discover why the patrons of their "posh resort," the Alexandria, are being killed off.  The game has a futuristic, cyberpunk feel to it as you negotiate the halls of the resort in a first-person slideshow style similar to that of Myst.  Although unlike Myst, you have control of an extensive inventory.
