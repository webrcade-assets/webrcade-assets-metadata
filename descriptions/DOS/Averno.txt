In Averno, the player controls a ghost in a puzzle game where each level is confined to a single screen. The objective is to collect all keys and use them to open all doors. Levels are constructed from individual blocks. The ghost can move left and right, and climb blocks of one or two heights, but cannot jump. It can also drop blocks horizontally if there is free space below. Players can fail a level by either running out of time or getting stuck in a dead end, which requires resetting the level and costs one of the five lives.
