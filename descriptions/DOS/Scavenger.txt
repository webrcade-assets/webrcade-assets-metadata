Scavenger is an originally shareware clone of Lode Runner that was released as freeware and open source. The core game mechanics are the same as in Lode Runner : the player controls a character who must navigate a level that fits into a single fixed screen, and collect items while avoiding or trapping hostile characters that are pursuing the player. In addition to running, climbing ladders and jumping off them, it is possible to dig temporary holes in the ground to trap enemies or access certain items. Once all treasure on the level has been collected, a ladder appears leading to the next one.The game comes with a tile editor and level editor, allowing to create custom content. In the original shareware release, the level editor did not allow to save any changes, and the number of levels was limited compared to the registered version.
