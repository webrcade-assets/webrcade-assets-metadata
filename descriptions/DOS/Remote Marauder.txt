Remote Marauder is an arcade game in two parts, where the 1st part subtitled The Martian Conflict is available as a download, while the second part The Saturn Rebellion is available when registering the first.
The game is described as an action game in which you are a contracted hunter in your flying craft, which initially takes place around Mars, where the human colony is being attacked by alien cyber organisms. The enemies are the indigenous Marsians living underground, called Naxraega, whose aim is to remove the humans from their planet.
Apart from the cyber organisms themselves, ultimately there is a factory creating the cyborgs that needs to be destroyed.
Destroying enemies results in credits to pick up that can be used for upgrades of your ship in the stores - found in friendly sky-bases, where you can get both clues to the story and purchase upgrades for your ship.
The second part of the game is presumably set around Saturn.
