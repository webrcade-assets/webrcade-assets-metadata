Ping & Kooky’s Cuckoo Zoo is an educational game for young children ages 3–6.
The player joins the panda Ping and the bird Cuckoo, as they take the player by train to five different educational areas.  Each location represents a different environment, including: polar, savannah, rainforest, park, and farm.
As the player rides the train, their movement on the track is shown from a first-person perspective.  The player can use a variety of whistles and bells, stop and start the train, or choose their destination. In the savannah, the player practices colors and dresses and colors animals. In the rainforest, children practice their ABCs. On the farm, children play hide and seek. Children practice numbers and counting in the arctic, and can put on a presentation in the park with all the animals.
