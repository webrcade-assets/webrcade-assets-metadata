Motor Mania is a shareware motorcycle game in which the object is to race through a series of jumps in a limited amount of time. Not only is time a critical factor, the player must manage their engine to avoid overheating, for example by not using the turbo-charger when in the air so that it has time to cool.
The game is both keyboard and joystick-controlled and has options to play with a colour or monochrome monitor. There is a high score screen, the keyboard action keys can be redefined but there is no sound. In the registered version is a track designer function.
