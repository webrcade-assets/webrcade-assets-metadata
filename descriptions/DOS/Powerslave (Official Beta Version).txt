The earliest public release of Powerslave is a work-in-progress demonstration beta version which includes two levels, Abu Simbel and Dendur, with the former being vastly different from its namesake in the retail version. In addition, there are numerous differences in graphics, sound effects and engine behaviour, showing a pre-release state of the game. Unlike the final release, the beta demo supports MIDI music and contains a single unique track that loops during play.This version of Powerslave showcases six weapons (plus one hidden weapon), five enemy types, and a selection of powerups. While the game uses the system of lives instead of the ability to save the progress at any time, there are no checkpoints throughout the levels. Instead, a level is restarted completely upon the player's defeat, with all enemies and pickups restored in their original places; however, the player keeps all weapons, ammo and items collected during previous playthroughs.The demo levels can be played in any order, and are designed in such a way that the player may collect all necessary weapons and items in the second level without the need to complete the previous one first. This is different from the final version of Powerslave which does not have duplicate weapon pickups in later levels. There are also built-in cheats in the demo, described on the in-game help screen, that grant invincibility and access to all weapons and items.Being an early build of the game, the Powerslave beta has no support for multiplayer mode.
