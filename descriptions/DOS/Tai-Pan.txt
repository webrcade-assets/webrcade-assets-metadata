In this adaptation of James Clavell's book, the goal is to make a fortune in China. Before they can begin trading, the player will first have to get a loan to buy their ship, and then gather a crew either by paying them or simply kidnapping them.
The game has three main stages and a number of different gameplay elements, largely allowing the player to choose their own path. The first part of the game involves walking the streets trying to get the right elements and people, then moves onto the seas where the player has to sail to other trading cities. It is also possible to board other ships upon approaching them and battle those who are onboard.
