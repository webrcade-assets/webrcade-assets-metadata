Rotaktix is a single-player, shareware, tile matching game.
The game area is divided into a play area with nine columns, a status bar on the left, and a bar containing tiles/tokens across the top. The player uses the left/right arrows to slide the bar at the top of the screen so that when the tiles drop they form lines of three or more. Tiles that form runs of three or more disappear and any tiles above them drop down.
Each level consists of four rounds, each round has an objective such as making a specified number of rows horizontally within a set time. The objectives for each round become harder as the player progresses. In addition there are bonus rounds with no set objective other than to score as much as possible in a set time.
The game is keyboard controlled, it has alternate tile sets, sound, and a high score table.
