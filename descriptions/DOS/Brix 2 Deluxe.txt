Brix 2 Deluxe is a puzzle game, very similar to Puzznic, and it is a sequel to Brix. Each level is called a "problem" and consists of an array of pieces. The player can only move tiles horizontally left or right and gravity will cause the tiles to drop down. If two or more tiles with the same symbol touch they will disappear. The goal is to remove all tiles from the board.This version includes a few new game-play elements such as dropping tiles into water to make them disappear, laser beams that destroy tiles, a sand timer that flips the board upside down, teleporter tiles and breakable walls. There is a branching path of 7 levels, each hub along the path contains 4 levels making for 112 levels in total. There also is a password system to save your progress.
