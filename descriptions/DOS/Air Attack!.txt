In this variation on the well-known theme, the player sets off to the skies to inflict damage on the unsuspecting cities below. The bomber zig-zags across the heavens, losing altitude with every turnaround, and must judiciously drop bombs onto the awaiting architecture; the goal is to wipe out enough skyline to survive the descent.In familiar fashion, only one bomb can be dropped at a time. However, this version shows more mercy than most towards its urban targets: it isn't necessary to raze the whole town to the ground -- the bomber only has to reach about a third of the way down the screen, and then the blitzkrieg continues over the next city. On the other hand, there are no extra lives, so the first brush with a building will end the game instantly.
