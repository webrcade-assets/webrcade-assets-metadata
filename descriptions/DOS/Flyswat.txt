Flyswat, as the descriptive title conveys, simulates an everyday activity that's decidedly less fun than what's usually associated with games: the annoyance of being pestered by a housefly while sitting in your easy chair and trying to read a book! Seeking to end the distraction, you pull out your trusty flyswat and attempt to flatten the buzzing little pain-in-the-butt. This is done by moving a cursor across the screen, getting within swatting distance of the fly, and hitting space to do the grisly deed; the difficulty level determines how fast and unpredictable the fly will get. When you finally splatter the pest, you'll be scored by the time and number of swats it took you. Then you can continue your literary pursuits - no doubt feeling a little less irritated, and a little more bad-ass.
