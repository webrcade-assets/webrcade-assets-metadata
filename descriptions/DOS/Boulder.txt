Boulder is a 2D puzzle game that is reminiscent of Boulder Dash. The player controls a yellow, smiling creature. In each level, the goal is to pick up a certain number of diamonds so that the exit will appear somewhere in the map, and then reach said exit. Among other things, levels can contain pushable blocks (which unlike the player, are affected by gravity), as well as bombs and keys. The game includes a scoring system and a countdown timer that affects the score, although there is no time limit to complete each level. A password system allows the player to revisit previously played levels. Boulder also comes with an editor so that players can create their own levels.
