Mind Castle II is an educational adventure game for the Apple II.
During the player's adventures in Mind Castle I , they escaped the haunted old mansion owned by Mr. Winn.
Upon visiting their local library, the player finds an old newspaper clippings about millions in old Confederate bills that may be hidden deep within the deceased Mr. Winn's mansion. The old mansion out on Route 1 has now been boarded up for public safety, but the desire for adventure and riches gets the better of the player, and they decide to investigate the building. Upon climbing through a gate to the basement, the player becomes trapped within Mind Castle.
Here, the player meets a number of Mr. Winn's family and employees, who still possess the mansion. The player must move between rooms of the mansion, while they slowly work their way up a number of floors. Each room possesses a riddle based upon logic or pattern recognition. If the player completes enough riddles, they move to a higher floor, where they meet a new riddlemaster. The residents of the manor can offer hints if requested. The challenges become more difficult as the player ascends.
