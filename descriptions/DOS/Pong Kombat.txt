Created during the golden age of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Pong Kombat is a freeware parody of the game combining it with the low-tech Pong. There's even a storyline revolving around the ancient powerful white paddle (remember him?) and the multi-coloured younger paddles who would challenge him. There's even talk of a mysterious Monolith, secret character of great power, hidden somewhere in the tournament.
Gameplay is similar to normal Pong but with the exception that each Paddle also has a projectile attack that can harm the opponent. First player to 10 points wins the match and will activate the words "FINISH HIM!" wherein the player has the chance to enter a command sequence and complete that particular paddle's finishing move... gore and all. Just like Mortal Kombat, some levels are dangerous and feature their own special finishing moves which utilize the environment.
