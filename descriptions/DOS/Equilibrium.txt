Equilibrium is a puzzle strategy game where the goal is to fill an 8x8 grid with a single color. Players control a cursor, a smaller colored square, navigating it across the grid. "Placing" the cursor changes the color of the selected grid square to the cursor's color; subsequently, the cursor randomly changes color. Whenever a corner of three cells of the same color is created, the fourth cell enclosed by the corner is changed to that color. The color changes are affected by a hierarchy, where the spread of lighter colors takes precedence over darker colors.The gameplay of Equilibrium is marked by several limitations. Players are constrained by a time limit for moving the cursor, a restriction on the number of cursor moves, and a maximum number of turns (cursor placements) per level. These constraints increase in severity as players progress through the game's sixteen levels, each named after a different color. Completing a level with the grid matching the level's theme color awards extra points.Equilibrium also incorporates random elements that add to its challenge. The color of the cursor is randomly chosen from the existing colors on the board, with a slight chance of it being an entirely different color. Additionally, there is a possibility of random mutations where cells on the grid spontaneously change color.
