Girl Poker is a traditional (non-variant) poker game in which the player competes one-on-one against a single CPU opponent, choosing from a selection of four female opponents (3 manga-style characters, 1 realistic) each with different playing attributes. In addition to the normal bet/raise/stand/call/fold mechanic, at the start of each hand the player has the option to spend their money on a secret "move" which may give them an unfair advantage in the game. These secret moves include the ability to see their opponent's cards, steal one of their cards, swap their cards for better ones, etc. The game's developers hinted that there may be other secret moves available within the game as well as the possibility that the CPU opponent has access to their own secret moves, but this was left for the player to discover. The opponents are also intelligent enough to notice if the player cheats in an obvious way (i.e. they've used their secret move to get 5 aces or 2 ace of hearts, etc.) and will automatically win the hand if they haven't previously folded and the player has had to reveal their cards.
Play ends when either the player or their opponent runs out of money. If the player wins, they get to view some character art of their opponent. These pictures are slightly risqu√© but artistic depictions of the characters in semi-revealing outfits or lingerie, and show them in their alter-ego form (as a fashionable pop idol, sword-wielding warrior from the future, other-world deity, etc.). The game itself is themed around a fantasy RPG-style world but this appears to have no bearing on the gameplay.
