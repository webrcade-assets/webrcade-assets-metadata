Stunts ( 4D Sports Driving outside of US) is a 3D car racing simulation that puts emphasis on racing on stunt tracks. The game contains a variety of cars, courses and opponents to choose from (who represent a difficulty level). The game provides unusual stunt objects including loops, corkscrews and jumps. Race tracks contain three types of surfaces: paved road, gravel road and ice. Each of them offer different grip and traction. There is also grass and water that surround roads. The former slows down the car and the latter is lethal and the car instantly crashes. It is possible to watch races in instant replay from different camera angles. A track editor is included as well.
