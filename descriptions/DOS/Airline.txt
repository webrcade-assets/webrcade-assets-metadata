Airline is a managerial simulation in which the player is responsible for an airline corporation. The majority of the game is spent in menu and sub-menu screens which allow to buy/sell/lease aircraft, advertising, hiring staff or simply managing the balance. Because the overall goal is obviously to earn money, the most important part is to get orders and to select a suitable aircraft and crew to perform it on time. Of course things do not always smoothly which then requires the player to intervene personally in an action sequence, e.g. landing an aircraft or loading cargo. Those are mandatory and can be practised against a fee. Each turn represents one month.Additionally the game offers a multiplayer mode, three starting scenarios (founding a new airline, taking over an existing one or recapitalizing an unprofitable one), three difficulty levels and historical information on aircraft.
