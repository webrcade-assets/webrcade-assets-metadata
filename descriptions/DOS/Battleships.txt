Battleships is a simple, shareware, two player version of the traditional game.
This implementation is played on a 10x10 grid where players hide an aircraft carrier, a battleship, a cruiser, a submarine and a patrol boat. All vessels are placed horizontally.
The game is entirely keyboard-controlled, uses character graphics and has sound effects.
