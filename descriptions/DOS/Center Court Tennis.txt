A slightly isometric top-down tennis game between two players, either computer or human. Players can choose three types of field to play on: grass, dirt or clay as well as three difficulty settings.
Players can create a new character and save its statistics to track its progress. The game features the standard rules of tennis, where a ball must be hit over the net into the opposing player's area of the court.
