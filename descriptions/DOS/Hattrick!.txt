Saturday - half past 3 p.m.
Ideal soccer weather for soccer. The stadium is sold out. The fans are singing the team hymn.
You're team is 2 points behind the leader. This is the match of the year for you and your team. The next 90 minutes will decide over success or failure. You have to win if your team want to be next year in the first division. The pressure is mighty. You have to calm your nerves.
You sit on the hottest seat in soccer. You are the manager of your favorite team and have to lead your the team from the amateur division into the European first class.
Hattrick! is another German soccer manager. There are two different modes. The serious and the funny one. The difference you see in the game newspaper reviews.
