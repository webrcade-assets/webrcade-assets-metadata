As Lemmings spawned its annual Holiday Lemmings specials, so too the Lemmings parody Lamers yielded this festive spin-off. Following the Lamers premise of AI-controlled Lemming-like Lamers (here dressed in Santa suits) securing their own safe passage through a hostile landscape toward a computer for them to muck up, the task before the player is to use all tools available to thwart them. With more seasonal hazards to employ than the conventional arms featured in its predecessor, here the player deploys limited amounts of Christmas toys and cruel factors of the winter weather -- snowballs and buckets of ice water. Will nothing drive away these Lamers?
