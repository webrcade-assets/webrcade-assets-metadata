Wuz is a short, single player, humorous, text adventure game. It is claimed to be one of the first erotic works of erotic interactive fiction and possibly the first to allow the player to choose their sex and orientation and to have different paths depending on those choices.
The game starts with the player waking up in a cell of some kind, they carry nothing and they are wearing nothing. The seems to be no door on the cell so they set off exploring, as soon as they do so their fairy godmother appears and offers the choice of gender before vanishing. The player continues to explore the stainless steel corridors and beyond meeting aliens and others along the way.
