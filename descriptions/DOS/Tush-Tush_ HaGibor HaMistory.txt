Based on an Israeli interactive television game which was played by selected audience members via the telephone, the game puts you in the hands of Tush-Tush, an unusual hero called to save the kingdom and the king's wealth.
The game consists of three different adventures.  In the first adventure, Tush-Tush has to escape a lost temple with the greatest diamond in the world.  The second adventure sends the hero to the Himalayas, Tush-Tush must collect diamond flowers and reach the airship that would take him home in time.  The last adventure puts Tush-Tush in a chase after the thieving King Evil.
In each adventure Tush-Tush must collect the treasure and reach his goal while avoiding the various obstacles.
Gameplay is similar to that of the original TV show.  The player must use the number pad (or four arrow keys) in order to move Tush-Tush left, right and make him jump and crouch.
