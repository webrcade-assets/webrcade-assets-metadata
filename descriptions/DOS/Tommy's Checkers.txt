Tommy's Checkers is a shareware Checkers management game.
This game has no playing capability itself, it documents a game thus allowing matches to be played via mail or email with other players. Features include:

Saving the current position, part of a game or a whole game.
Backstepping, i.e. an undo function.
Editing the board at any time.
Annotating the game with comments and/or sound effects.
Replaying a game.

The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
