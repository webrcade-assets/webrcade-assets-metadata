Backroad Racers is basically the same game as European Racers with a different scenario. As in the predecessor, the four cars ( '67 Chevelle, '71 Hemi 'Cuda, '67 Malibu SS Pro and '70 Boss 302 Mustang) and their parts can be viewed and disassembled in a CAD-like program option. There are also possibilities for slight modifications, e.g. adding nitro.
Those cars can then be used to race on on the four courses (forest, mountains, beach or bayou) against a distinctive opponent, e.g. a surfer dude. The courses mostly consist of straight roads and sharp curves and require the player to drive fast - however, there are speed traps which should be avoided. One addition is the need to visit garages in order to repair damages. Depending on what happens, the player may get to watch real-live video clips of cops or other persons which are mostly identical to the predecessor's.
Also included are promotional videos about the cars and a model kit for the Boss 302 Mustang.
