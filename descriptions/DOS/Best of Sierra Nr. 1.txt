Since this is the first Volume, here are a bit general informations about "Best of Sierra": "Best of Sierra" gets released every second month. It offers 2 (full version) games on one CD, the CD is then filled with some game and few program demos from Sierra. Sometimes there are some gimmicks there too, like special screensaver, or a bonus game, etc. The CD comes with the "Best of Sierra"-magazine, which is about 60 pages thick, and contains the manuals and cheats/walkthroughs for the individual games, but also articles about the included games, and sometimes about upcoming Sierra games, all in all it is plenty illustrated.
The June/July 1997 issue (Volume 1) contains the following full version games:

Metaltech: Earthsiege

The magazine features, along with the manuals to the title games, a 14 pages long background story for Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, written in comic style. And in addition, it offers a detailed, 8 pages long, walkthrough for this game too.
