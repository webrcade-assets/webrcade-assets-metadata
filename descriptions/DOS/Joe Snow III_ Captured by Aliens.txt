It's unclear who the aliens are and what they want, because we only have the title to go by, but they've got Joe and it's time for another round of platform jumping and treasure collecting.  Things do change this time around, however, since the thoughtful aliens have seen fit to provide Joe with a few new perks not present in the previous games: music, scrolling, and save slots.Thanks to the scrolling feature, the levels are larger and more abstract than before, and this time they're entered from an external "overworld"-type level (where the game can also be saved).  In contrast to the "score as health" system from the first two games, actual lives are used, so any contact with a fiery hazard will melt Joe down instantly... complete with a hissing sound effect.
