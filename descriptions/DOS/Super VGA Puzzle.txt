Super VGA Puzzle is a single-player, shareware, jigsaw puzzle game. The puzzle pieces are rectangles rather than the interlocking kind seen in real life.
The player selects a graphic mode - VGA or SVGA, then a picture, then defines the complexity of the puzzle which can be up to forty tiles wide by forty tiles deep. The picture is then broken into many pieces and scrambled for the player to reassemble, left mouse click selects a piece while the right mouse piece places it, once a piece has been placed correctly it cannot be moved again.
The shareware version of the game comes with two pictures, one of robins and another of a water buffalo working in an Asian rice field. It has a save/load feature, a hint feature and a 'Hall of Fame' high score table, it also has simple sound effects bleeps when pieces are placed correctly and a gong which sounds when the puzzle is completed.
