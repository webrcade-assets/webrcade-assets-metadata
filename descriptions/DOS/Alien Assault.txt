In Alien Assault, an unrelenting war rages between humanity and extraterrestrial forces. Alas, humanity teeters on the brink of defeat. But a glimmer of hope remains: infiltrate the alien headquarters and obliterate it. Tragically, upon arrival, the entire team - save for the protagonist - was wiped out. Now, it falls upon the playerâ€™s shoulders to rescue the world.This top-down shooter thrusts players into a perilous journey across ten maze-like levels. The objective? Locate the exit. To achieve this, the protagonist must engage in intense firefights with roaming enemies, preventing them from draining his life energy. Additionally, keys scattered throughout the levels unlock sealed doors, granting access to crucial areas. Along the way, the protagonist can collect ammo and health refills to sustain his fight. The game operates on a tile-based system, where each button press corresponds to a specific move. For instance, if the player character faces downward, pressing the right arrow button merely rotates them counterclockwise; to move right, the button must be pressed again.
