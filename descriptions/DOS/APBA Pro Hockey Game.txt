APBA Pro Hockey Game is a digital adaptation of the board game APBA Hockey. This software enables users to simulate ice hockey leagues by loading season data disks (which come included with the purchased version or can be bought separately). Leagues, players and teams can be edited.
The matches are completely conveyed through text descriptions. The only interactions are choosing the lineup before the match and setting the general tactics (defensive to offensive in five increments). During the match there will be two possible scenarios with player input: choosing between three tactics (skate, dump or change) when the puck reaches center ice and choosing between three options (change lineup, timeout or nothing) before a faceoff.
