Hungry? is a clone of the Ataxx board game. All graphics in the game are in text mode. There are two difficulty levels for the computer opponent, but there is no two-player mode.The players start with two tokens in the opposite corners of a 8x8 board. In each turn, a player can clone his piece onto an adjacent square (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), or move a piece two squares in a specific direction. If a piece is placed on a square adjacent to the opponent's pieces, all of them get converted to the player's color. The game ends once the players have no more moves, at which point the player with more pieces is the winner.
