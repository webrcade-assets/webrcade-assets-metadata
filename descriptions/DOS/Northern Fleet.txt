The player is also given the length of time until additional ships arrive in the naval theater. In the second section, the player gives movement orders to each taskforce, as well as submarine and air support. In the third section, the player is given the results of intelligence collection, searches by task force and submarines, as well as the options to launch attacks against a particular target or location.The game starts at rising tension, but as direct combat between forces continues, there is the risk of escalating to global nuclear warfare, at which point the game ends.
