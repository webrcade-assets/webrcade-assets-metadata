Your peaceful colony out in space was just minding its own business, when it suddenly came under attack by a marauding, cross-shaped alien vessel.  This unrelenting foe seems to have its eyes (and its lasers!) on the colony food stores, which must be protected at all costs; your only defense is a single ship, armed with a random number of torpedoes.The invader can fire its lasers in four directions simultaneously - your shields can absorb one hit, but a second one is immediately fatal.  There are numerous ways to win the fight: a well-placed torpedo shot, a successful boarding (if you can get close enough), or just staying alive until the enemy wanders off.  On the other hand, if your ship is shot down, the food stations are destroyed, or even if you ditch your mission and wander off the screen yourself, the colony is kaput.
