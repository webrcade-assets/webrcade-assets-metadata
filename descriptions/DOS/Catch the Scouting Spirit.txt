Catch the Scouting Spirit (also known as NSF - The Game) is a Boulder Dash variant themed after the Norwegian Guide and Scout Association (NSF). The player character is a Boy Scout tasked with retrieving all the NSF badges that were stolen by Dr Mayhem.The game follows the classic formula: you need to collect a predesignated number of badges and get to the level exit before the countdown timer reaches zero. There are, of course, boulders that can fall and obstruct the way, slime that slowly grows and threatens to consume everything around it, and hostile aliens that patrol certain levels. Unlike classic Boulder Dash, each level takes up exactly one screen, and gameplay is a bit more puzzle-oriented, similar to Heartlight or Die Pirateninsel.Catch the Scouting Spirit was written in QBasic and contains 25 levels split into five episodes with different tilesets that represent various locations on Earth, and even the moon. There are very simple PC Speaker sound effects and no music. At startup, the language can be set to either Swedish or English. The game was released as freeware, but the source code was lost by the author.
