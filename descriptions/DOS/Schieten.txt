Schieten (Dutch for shoot) is a one-button shooting game. On the screen a shooting target is shown and a randomly moving dot. The objective of the game is to press the spacebar when the dot is as close as possible to the bullseye. The closer the dot is to the center of the target, the more points the player gets.After 25 bullets have been fired, the game ends.
