Switch is a translation of an old brain-teaser, also known as the 'leapfrog puzzle'. The are a two sets of pegs on the board - five red ones on the left, and five green ones on the right, with a single space in the middle. The idea is to fully switch the positions of the two groups by moving one peg at a time, with restrictions: pegs can only be moved into the blank space, either by a single step or by leaping over another peg. Red pegs move only to the right, and green pegs move only to the left. The game keeps track of the number of moves made.
