Agravation is an unofficial adaptation of the board game Aggravation (which itself is an adaptation of Pachisi). Two to four players (there is no AI) try to bring all four pieces from their base into the home. The board is arranged as a cross, and the four homes (all are shown even if fewer players are participating) are arranged opposite of each other. Each turn, the player rolls a die and decides which piece is moving the same amount as the roll result. However, entering the board from the base requires either a one or six. Each piece has to do a full run around the playing board, then enter the home base (located on the longer side of the cross) and is not allowed to pass other pieces from the same player. Landing on top of another player’s piece sends it back to the other player’s base.
