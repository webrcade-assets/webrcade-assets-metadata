Micro Adventure No. 3: Million Dollar Gamble is a novel and series of type-in BASIC adventures for multiple systems.
Secret agent Orion, computer whiz on ACT (Adventure Connection Team) has been marked for kidnapping by the evil forces of BRUTE (the Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil).  They plan to pull off the computer crime of the century, and Orion has broken into their system.
With the help of ACT agents including Hot Wheels, Chameleon, and Tracer, Orion must stay one step ahead of BRUTE, and foil their crime.

An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with many of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.
