Fungal Man is a puzzle game where you have to push fungi into so-called damper pods in order to destroy them. Both fungi and damper pods can be pushed by walking into them, like in classic Sokoban -style games. There are also some power-ups, for example the "hyper" that allows you to switch places with an item next to you. And there are also objects that can kill you, such as landmines. The game's levels present you with challenging scenarios where you have to figure out how to move the fungus to the damper pod without dying.
