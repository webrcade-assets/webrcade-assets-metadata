Harpoon II Deluxe: Multimedia Edition is an updated Harpoon II CD-ROM release expanded with two additional BattleSets : Global Conflicts II and Global Conflicts III (including Global Conflicts I from the original release), 45 missions in total. The new scenarios deal with a "what-if" NATO vs. USSR/Russia conflict. A scenario editor is also available. As suggested by the title, many audio & video clips were added to illustrate the arsenal given at player's disposal.
Later issues also came with Regional Conflicts I BattleSet added as a bonus.
