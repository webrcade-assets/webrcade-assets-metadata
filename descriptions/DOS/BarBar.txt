BarBar is an action game. You move around the screen, avoiding or killing enemies (and avoiding missiles coming from the top of the level), while a wall fills in more and more of the level. If you survive long enough, the wall will retreat, leaving various blocks behind. Your weapons include a laser (travels in one direction, can destroy one block or enemy) and a bomb (destroys anything near it). If you are hit, you lose health and teleport to a random spot on the level. Destroying walls (using any method) can drop health, laser energy or bombs.
