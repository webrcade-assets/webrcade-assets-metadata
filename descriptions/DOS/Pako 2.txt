Pako 2 is a Pac-Man variant and the follow-up to the original Pako. Just like in the original concept the player's character has to eat all dots in a maze to get a score and move on to the next level. Enemies roam around the maze and need to be avoided. The dots come in different forms and colours for each level. There are also power pill that turn the tables and allow the character to eat enemies. Compared to the original game this title contains music and timed games where all dots need to be eaten before time runs out.
