VGAWHEEL is a wheel of fortune, shareware game for one to three players. It is based upon an earlier game EGAWHEEL which uses a different graphical standard.
The game play follows the famous television game. The player(s) are presented with words which can be a phrase, a name or a thing. All the letters are blanked out and they take turns in guessing which letters could be part of the hidden word(s). Before each choice is made the eponymous "Wheel Of Fortune" is spun and this determines the value of each letter revealed, or it may bankrupt the player or cause them to miss a turn.
The game is played entirely with the keyboard, it has sound effects and comes with a puzzle editor.
The shareware game with two hundred puzzles was distributed via Bulletin Boards, BBSs, and was a taster of the full game which had seven thousand puzzles.
