ThreeDEE Tic Tac Toe is an implementation of three-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe, taking place in a 4×4×4 cube, with each layer being rendered in an oblique perspective. Two human players can play against each other, or a human player can play against the computer opponent, which can be set to one of three tactics (defensive, offensive, or a combination of the two). The computer can also be set to play against itself, with both sides using the same tactic.The field for the next move is selected by using the cursor and Page Up/Page Down keys. The game keeps track of the number of rounds won by each side. In a single-player game, the human player always gets the first move in the first round. After that, in all play modes, the losing player of each round gets the first move in the next one.
