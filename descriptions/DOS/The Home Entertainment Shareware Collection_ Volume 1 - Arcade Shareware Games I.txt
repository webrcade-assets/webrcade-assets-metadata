Arcade Shareware Games 1 is the first of two "arcade" game compilation CDs in Aztech New Media's 7-volume Home Entertainment Shareware Collection. It is a collection of DOS games, most of which can be described more or less as "arcade" titles.The games in this compilation are all shareware, freeware, or demonstration games. They are accessed via 'QuikMenu', a shareware menu system (which itself frequently reminds the user that it requires registration). Some of the games will run directly from the CD while others, denoted by white entries on the menu, must be copied to the user's hard drive first before playing. Each game can be selected via the mouse, or by pressing the character key corresponding to an individual game.The order in which the games appear in the list below is the order of the selection keys on the game menu, with 'A' corresponding to Raptor, 'B' to Duke Nukem, and so on.The games in this compilation are:Raptor: Call of the Shadows (listed as "Raptor")Duke Nukem (listed as "Duke Nuk'Em 1")Duke Nukem II (listed as "Duke Nuk'Em 2")Earth Invasion (listed as "Earth Invaders")Arcade VolleyballArk...
