Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is the remake of the second chapter of Miner Willy's adventures. In the first game, Willy got a fortune with his exploits and treasure huntings. One night, he invites the jet-set to a superb and savage party in his huge mansion, and when the party is finished, the house is a complete disorder - even disaster. Although Willy only wants to go to rest, his maid, Maria, goes on strike. Willy has to collect all trash from the party: more than 150 objects spread over more than 100 rooms. But there's a rumour about the last owner of the house. They say he was a sort of mad scientist, and that night all his creations are going to awaken.
The premise from Manic Miner (collect objects and evade guardians and obstacles) is still present, but now rooms are not linear (you have to explore the mansion), and there is no time limit.
