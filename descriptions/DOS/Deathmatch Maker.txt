As the developer suggests, Deathmatch Maker is "the first Quake level editor authorized by id Software". What made it special among the editors of the time was its drag-and-drop interface. Unlike the standard approach of building rooms step-by-step, out of scratch, DMM offers the would-be mapper a collection of basic templates and 3D shapes. Once the basis is formed, texturing, entity placing and lighting is also done through a simple, user-friendly interface. A real-time 3D window lets the user to explore his creation without compiling the in-progress map and launching the game.
The package also contains a dozen of third-party editing utilities, as well as the Virtus' Episode, a brand new set of connected levels spanning over two episodes and featuring a different boss.
