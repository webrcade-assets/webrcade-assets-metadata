The 7th Square is a single player, sliding block, puzzle game. The game is based on a 7x7 grid in which there are coloured tiles. There is a smaller grid in the upper right of the game screen and the player must recreate the smaller grid's pattern in the main grid by moving its rows and columns. The game is played entirely with the mouse and has a high score table and multiple difficulty settings. It is supplied with a level designer which enables players to create their own patterns.The game was written to demonstrate what an individual developer could achieve using BASIC and the install package includes the developer's notes on how the game was developed.
