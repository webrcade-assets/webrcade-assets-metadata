EGAint Is Not Tetris... got it?  In fact, it's a freeware Tetris style game, one of the earliest such releases on the IBM PC.  Being that it was so small (under 100kb, an easy 2400 baud download), Egaint lacked the background pictures Tetris players enjoyed, but it did sport high-resolution graphics and some custom game settings, including several exotically-named block styles, and shapes not seen in most Tetris clones.  The game featured a "tournament mode", with a fixed, non-random set of falling blocks, but no multiplayer support.  The package also included a separate, text-mode version, simply called AINT.
