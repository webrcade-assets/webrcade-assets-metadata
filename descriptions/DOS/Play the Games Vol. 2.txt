This compilation is the successor of Play the Games Vol. 1. It is still a joint-venture between three big publishers, where each publisher contributes one third of the compilation, but they are not the same publishers anymore. Electronic Arts and Infogrames are still present, but Virgin was replaced by Eidos.
The compilation consists of 15 games spread over 18 CD's, which are stored in four quad CD jewel cases (for four CD's), where one is actually a hexa CD jewel case (for six CD's). The box has changed from the standard box format to a big over-sized box.
The printed manual is only some sort of reference card. Complete manuals are on the CD in PDF format.
