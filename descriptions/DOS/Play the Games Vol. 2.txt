This compilation is the successor of Play the Games Vol. 1. It is still a joint-venture between three big publishers, where each publisher contributes one third of the compilation, but they are not the same publishers anymore. Electronic Arts and Infogrames are still present, but Virgin was replaced by Eidos.The compilation consists of 15 games spread over 18 CD's, which are stored in four quad CD jewel cases (for four CD's), where one is actually a hexa CD jewel case (for six CD's). The box has changed from the standard box format to a big over-sized box.The printed manual is only some sort of reference card. Complete manuals are on the CD in PDF format.Electronic Arts' part of the compilation:Command & Conquer: Red AlertWarhammer: Dark OmenSid Meier's Gettysburg!Superbike World ChampionshipFuture Cop: L.A.P.D.Infogrames' part of the compilation:Heart of DarknessV-Rally: Multiplayer Championship EditionHerrscher der MeereAirline TycoonThe Smurfs: The TeletransportsmurfEidos' part of the compilation:Gangsters: Organized CrimeTomb Raider IIIan Livingstone's Deathtrap DungeonFlight Unlimited IIWorld League Soccer '98
