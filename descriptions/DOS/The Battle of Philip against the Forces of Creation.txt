The Battle of Philip against the Forces of Creation is a fantasy text adventure game. You play the role of an ordinary man called Philip, and the game begins just as a portal has been torn open between the real world and another dimension, right in the middle of Philip's home. Through the rift, a cleric from the other world named Tark has appeared. Phil soon discovers that the fate of the world is at stake, and that he will need to battle against an evil mage named Naron Blooder to prevent monumental disaster. Tark is willing to help, and there are many spells that Tark can perform, under normal circumstances -- but now, dazed and far from home, Tark's abilities are compromised.
