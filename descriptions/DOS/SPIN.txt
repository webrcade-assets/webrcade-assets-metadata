SPIN is a 2D, top-down space shooter. The player controls a space ship and it enters a solar system where the freighter lanes have been overrun by pirates. Your mission is to clear the freighter lanes and protect the freighters from the pirate ships who are looting the freighters.
A radar in the top left part of the screen is used to track down the threatened freighters and locate weapon and shield upgrades for the ship. The pirate escape pods use warp technology to jump away from their ship if it is destroyed. These pods can be picked up to arrest the pirates.
