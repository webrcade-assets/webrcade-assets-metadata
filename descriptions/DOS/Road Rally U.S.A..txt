Road Rally U.S.A. is a geography learning arcade game for multiple systems.
The player must go on a roadtrip through one of 6 real geographic locations in the U.S.A. The player controls their vehicle from a top-down perspective, and must follow roads while avoiding roadside dangers including thunderstorms, mailboxes, and falling rocks. The level of difficulty defines the dangers of these obstacles. The player is given hints of where to go, and must follow a map to arrive at the corresponding location. Along the way, the player must fuel up at gas stations. The player gets points for every location reached, or for passing flag bearers on the side of the road. The player completes a challenge by arriving at 3 locations before they lose all of their vehicles. Whenever the player runs out of gas or their vehicle is hit, they lose a car. The player has a total of 4 cars, and it's game over when all are lost.
