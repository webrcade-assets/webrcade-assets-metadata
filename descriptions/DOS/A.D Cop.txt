A.D Cop is a rail-shooter game, a clone of Virtua Cop. The game is all about fast aiming and features six missions, although only three are available at the beginning. Each mission is divided into three stages with a level boss at the end. The player (policeman) uses a special helmet equipped with a viewfinder computer. The computer marks the opponent in a frame defining the threat level and time remaining to attack. The player is equipped with a gun and bazooka. During the mission he can raise the weapon of the killed opponent, f.e. shotgun, grenade, M-16, automated pistol. Killing a hostage takes one life. Life can be supplemented by finding a heart symbol.
v2.10 contains improved menu graphics and features full LightGun support.
