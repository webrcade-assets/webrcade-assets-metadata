Picture Perfect Golf is a multimedia golf simulator that uses actual photographs taken from a gazillion different angles to simulate the Harbour Town Golf Links course. Another difference this game has is it's perspective - instead of the traditional 3rd person-over-the-golfer perspective the game uses a first person perspective designed especially for use with an infrared golf club accessory (although the game can be played via keyboard/mouse), with the wind indicators, swing power bars, etc. onscreen.Other options include tournament, gimmies and mulligans game modes as well as multiplayer support for up to 4 players.
