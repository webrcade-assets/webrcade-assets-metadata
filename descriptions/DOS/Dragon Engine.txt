Dragon Engine is a game construction set that allows users to create and play their own fantasy role-playing games with an overhead perspective. It reproduces, and attempts to improve upon, the playing mechanics found in the classic Ultima games, more specifically in Ultima IV and V, and generally emulates the look and feel of these games. It also adds enhanced features like the ability to play full motion video sequences, wavetable soundcard support, and lighting effects.
The included sample game showcases Dragon Engine 's various capabilities. The game world has a major castle, several towns, caves and towers, allowing the player's party to interact with various NPCs, gear up and gain experience in battles with monsters to level up. However, there is no main plot/quest, and no overarching goal for the player to follow.
