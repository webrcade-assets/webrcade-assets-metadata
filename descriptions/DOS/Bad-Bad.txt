The nameless protagonist of Bad-Bad is a 25-year old male who wants to escape his family house in order to run away with his 15-year old girlfriend. He has to avoid his family members because they want to kill him for pedophilia.
The game starts in the protagonist's room and the gameplay consists of choosing which exit to take. The correct exit continues the game and the wrong exit means death. There is also a time limit of 30 minutes: leaving a room deducts 30 seconds. After finding the girlfriend, the player needs to find a safe room in order to make out with her. This is done by choosing one of four actions (kiss, suck tits, eat her, have sex) and assigning the number of minutes spent on the action. Using the wrong room or trying to leave without having sufficient sex leads to a game over. Afterwards, the player needs to find the correct way out in order to win the game and being assigned a score. The score is dependent on the time left.
