Robomath is a multiplication arcade game for multiple systems.
The player controls a horizontally moving paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit a rapidly bouncing ball. A number of Trashbots come pouring out of the factory above. The player tries to hit balls into the pockets on the side of the play field to destroy the Trashbot factory and move on to the next level. If the large wall in the center is struck, more Trashbots come pouring out of the factory. Trashbots drop trash in the playing field when produced, which the ball will bounce off of. A Roboman will regularly appear on the screen and package trash, which allows it to be destroyed, and also drops off question boxes. If the player strikes a question mark, they must answer a multiplication question, where a correct answer helps remove trash from the play field. To win the game, the player must destroy all 16 trash factories.
There are different levels of multiplication and gameplay difficulty. If the player drops too many balls, it's game over.
