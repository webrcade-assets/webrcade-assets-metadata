Speed 4 Dummies is a sample game made with the DIV Games Studio development suite, showing such features as sprite scaling and rotation. It is a simple racing game for one or two players against up to three computer opponents, visually and graphically similar to such titles as Wacky Wheels or Street Racer. The game world is rendered in a flat pseudo-3D perspective, and the cars are represented with sprites rather than true 3D objects.
There are two tracks, forest and desert, and four different cars, although players cannot choose the appearance of the car that they're driving. The options allow to select the number of laps for each race, with the choice between three, six and nine laps. There are no powerups, and the only way to win is to carefully navigate the track, achieving higher speed when possible and slowing down at turns, as bumping into the track's boundaries will temporarily slow down the car to the minimum.
Speed 4 Dummies was included on the DIV Game Studio CD along with its complete source code, and the binary version without the code could be downloaded from the official site of the suite.
