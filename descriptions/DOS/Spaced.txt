Take a journey with Biff and Spiff to take back their crystal from an evil alien race. This crystal was their people's only power source which had given them their incredible
intelligence. But since it was stolen,  you have to listen Biff and Spiff's "incredibly" stupid conversations (you always have the choice to turn off this feature:)
Spaced is a 256-colors VGA shoot'em up which is created by only one person, Daniel Haffner. It has a very colourful super-scroll and "a bit cheesy" converted FM music from PC speaker music format...
