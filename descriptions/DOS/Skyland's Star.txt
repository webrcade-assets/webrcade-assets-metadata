Skyland's Star is a classic parser-based text adventure that was freely distributed on electronic bulletin boards by its creators. The player assumes the role of a scientist attempting to solve Earth's energy crisis. All of Earth's natural resources have been used up, so if no alternative energy source is found, civilization will collapse. You are sent into the future with a time machine and tasked with finding out how future civilizations solved the energy crisis, then bring that technology back into the present.
The time portal will only stay open for ten hours, so the player has to keep careful track of the time. Gameplay is classic text adventure fare: explore the world, pick up items, talk to NPCs, and solve puzzles.
