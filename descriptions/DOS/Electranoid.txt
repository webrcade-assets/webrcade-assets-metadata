Electranoid is an Arkanoid -style arcade game which features the same basic gameplay as its inspiration, with additional enemies thrown in. Like Arkanoid, the player's objective is to break all the bricks in a level and move on to the next level. Along the way, the player must also contend with enemy fighters like Menacers that launch balls of different colors (and corresponding effects) in an attempt to confuse him/her and Destroyers who will attempt to destroy the player by launching killer balls. But the player can gain an advantage by grabbing power-ups like lasers and multi-balls. In all, a registered user of this game can play up to 100 levels.
