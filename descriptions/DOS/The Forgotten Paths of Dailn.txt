The Forgotten Paths of Dailn appears to be nothing more than a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style book that was converted into computer form. You read the text on the screen and choose from a menu of options that influence how the story plays out. You "play" as Gavin Fallow, apprentice to the Wizard Albion. The Wizard sends you to pick up a package from the local apothecary, but the package is stolen and you need to get it back.
