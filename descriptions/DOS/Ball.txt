A simple pea-shooting simulation: each round starts with a target positioned randomly along the bottom of the screen.  At the top left is a pea, ready to be launched; the goal is to find the right velocity for the shot and hit the target precisely, in the fewest attempts possible.  The statistics box keeps track of the games played so far, displays a breakdown of the results, and calculates your average number of shots per successful hit - naturally, the lower the better.
