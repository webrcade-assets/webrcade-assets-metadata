As in the Lewis Carroll work, Victorian girlchild Alice Liddell avoids doing her tedious homework ("Could there possibly be" you think "a better day to go out and play and avoid studying Mathematics?") by escaping into a whimsical wonderland filled with bizarre characters. Many of the major characters (Cheshire Cat, Jabberwock) and locations (tea party, croquet game) in the stories make appearances in the game, though the plot is considerably streamlined, with occasional injections of anachronistic narration ( READ VORPAL SWORD -- It says "American Express Blade. Don't leave the garden without it.")
