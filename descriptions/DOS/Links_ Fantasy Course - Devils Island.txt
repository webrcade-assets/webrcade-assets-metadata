An add-on course compatible with Links, Links 386 Pro/Links Pro Macintosh, and Microsoft Golf. Devil's Island is the first Links add-on course to not be based on an actual course. Tropical in theme, Devil's Island is more difficult than most other courses, featuring narrow fairways, extremely deep rough, and strategically located trees and objects. Both distance and accuracy are required in most shots.
