Germany in the year 1600 - the empire of the Fuggers is destroyed. Now it's your turn to rise it again. "Die Fugger 2" is a turn based trading simulation. During the game you can expand your business over 16 towns and try to get emperor of the country. Trading is the way you'll get your money. But it's not that easy, your trails may be plundered, your stocks may burn down, or anything else. It's also possible to get your own pirate hideouts to plunder your competitors goods. But be careful, if they find out who did that, you may end up in prison. When you claim a higher political position it's possible for you to change laws, rise taxes and many more. This all sounds very complex, but after a few hours of playing it's quite easy to handle as the menues are clean and direct.
