U.S. Navy Fighters allows players to fly US naval aircraft over Ukraine in a war against Russia. The game features a campaign, single missions, an in-game single mission creator, and a quick mission creator. The game offers not typical cockpit view where instead of myriad of indicators, gauges and buttons, the player receives information in the corners of the screen in order to interact.
