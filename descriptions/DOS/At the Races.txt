As might be guessed from the title, this game is a straightforward horse race simulation, for 2 to 10 players.  Horses are numbered 1 through 5, each with different odds, though they stay the same between races.  Players start with $200 each; when all bets have been placed, the race commences, showing the five contenders rushing for the finish line.  The lucky winners get their earnings according to the results, and it's on to the next race (up to 10 per game); any player who goes broke is dropped from the running.
