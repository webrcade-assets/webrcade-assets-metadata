Bloodsport is a German shareware karate game, with three different modes:* Uchi-Komi: the training mode. Here you fight against your teacher and you can learn the various knocks and kicks. You just have to hit your teacher's board and fight him out of the mat.

Randori: now you're facing real opponents in front of the Fujiyama. All in all there are six, with increasing fighting skills, who have to be beaten one after the other. If you are able to do it, you are qualified for the Kumite.

Kumite: a tournament where you fight against the four best fighters. Like in the Randori you fight one after the other. After defeating them you win a poem containing the principles of martial arts.

The full version of Bloodsport features choosing between four different characters with special skills, fighting against a friend on the same screen and playing the whole Kumite (in the shareware version you can only play against one opponent).
