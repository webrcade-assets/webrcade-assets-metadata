When Tommy talks about "Hollywords" what he means are the names of people associated with Hollywood and some fifty years of film history.  And so for one to six players, he poses you with filmic word-scramblers, mixing up the names of movies and their two lead actors, then leaving you with a short description of the movie and its year of release to help decode the gibberish, unscrambling them by selecting misplaced letters and swapping them back into their correct place.  In early difficulty levels individual words are internally scrambled, while at harder levels entire phrases get scrambled.
