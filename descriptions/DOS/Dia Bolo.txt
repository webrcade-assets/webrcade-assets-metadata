Dia Bolo is a sequel to Dongleware's Arkanoid clone Bolo. It follows the same gameplay principles as its predecessor but adds a little story to the formula: a small devil has found his way into the player's computer and started counterfeiting paintings. It's up to the player to drive him out of the computer by playing this block-destroying game and thereby destroying the counterfeit paintings.Gameplay differs from the usual Arkanoid clones by allowing the paddle to be moved across the entire screen and having holes inside the board the ball can slip into, rather than having the bottom side of the screen be the deadzone. The game features 50 levels, each with its own little quirks, like different levels of gravity and special tiles that can't be harmed by the ball but must be touched by the paddle instead.
