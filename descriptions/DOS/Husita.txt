Husita is a historical real-time strategy game set during the Hussite Wars, the religious military conflict that raged over medieval Bohemia in the early 15 century. The single-player mode features separate campaigns for both the Hussites and the Crusaders, as well as 25 custom scenarios, and multiplayer games allow for up to 8 players compete over network.
Visually, Husita is rather similar to Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, especially in the look of unit and structure sprites. However, the way the economy is managed is closer to that in Seven Kingdoms : there are no natural resources to be mined or harvested, and to raise an army, the player needs sufficient population, money collected by taxing the subjects, and food to provided sustenance. Like in Seven Kingdoms, population grows over time, and additional subjects may join the player's side from nearby villages. On top of that, villagers have a mood/loyalty rating which is an important metric to watch, as unhappy citizens might very well rebel against their master.
Husita was sold commercially. A level editor was included with the game, and a further update also added a unit stats editor.
