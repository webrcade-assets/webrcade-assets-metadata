Bandor II is a shareware role-playing game that closely resembles its predecessor. It features the same three maps and retains the same game mechanics. Players explore the maps in first-person, while random turn-based combat encounters occur on a separate screen, where characters and enemies are displayed from a diagonal-down (almost top-down) perspective.The main differences from the predecessor include a new storyline (the Storm King has returned), five new quests, and some graphical and interface updates, such as the automap now displaying physical features like doors.
