Action SuperCross is an action game with puzzle elements. The player drives a trial bike with semi-realistic physics through a maze-like level. Collect all apples as fast as possible and then touch the white flower to complete the level. Avoid hitting the walls and floors with your head, and avoid spikes at any cost.There are 47 levels and the player may skip a maximum of five levels in total. You can save your replays to a file and the game comes with a comprehensive level editor. Both normal resolution 320x200 and high-resolution 640x480 vesa modes are supported.The game is based on a somewhat realistic physics model, with gravity, momentum and inertia. The player controls the bike by accelerating, breaking and leaning forward or backward, and the bike can flip directions front-to-back by pressing spacebar.
