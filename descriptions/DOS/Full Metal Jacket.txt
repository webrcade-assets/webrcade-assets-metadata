Full Metal Jacket is a mech action game played from a top-down perspective on a rotating playing field. The game is divided into separate missions, where the objective is to destroy certain targets using limited resources. Various tanks and other mechs are fought using evasive maneuvers and cover. Success is rewarded with funds, which can be used to equip the mech with guns, ammunition, explosives or a jetpack.
