Stugan is a Swedish text-based joke adventure game. Like in other text adventures you are presented with detailed descriptions of the place you are at, and the directions in which you can exit the area. You write simple commands (all in Swedish) to move in a direction, pick up, use or look at objects and talk to people.
The game takes place in and around a cottage (stuga, in swedish) in the Swedish province Sm√•land. The house is disproportionally large on the inside, with 9 floors and a basement with caves, mazes and traps you have to navigate through. As you navigate through the mazes you'll find items and treasures which you can use later on, or trade for extra points.
The game was originally written in BASIC in 1977-78 on the Oden Mainframe computer at QZ, the computer science institute of the Stockholm University and Royal Institute of Technology, where the game was also available for free for users of the mainframe. This version was later developed for DOS systems in 1985 and released commercially in 1986.
