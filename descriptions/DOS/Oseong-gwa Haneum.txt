Oseong and Haneum were the pen names of two distinguished scholars who lives in Korea in the late 16th and early 17th century, during the Joseon era. The characters became popular thanks to anecdotes depicting their childhood pranks. This interpretation of such tales is a puzzle game with adventure elements, similar to Gobliiins series. The player guides Oseong and Haneum through twenty single-screen stages, beginning with ordinary chores and ending with a journey to the dream world with various stylistic elements such as dinosaurs and high-tech environments.The young scholars are controlled with a simple point-and-click interface; the command icon can be changed for walking, picking up objects and using them. As opposed to Gobliiins, Oseong and Haneum have identical abilities, and the game arbitrarily chooses which one must be used to solve specific situations.
