You just wanted to call the breakdown service using the public phone, but suddenly a mysterious guy calls you "Adam", chains a suitcase to your arm and tells you to deliver it.
Blue Code is played similarly to the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books: You just say "yes" or "no". If you have the right item in your inventory the games chooses the appropriate action for you. Because of this most tasks consist of mini-games or buying the right item from the store. The only freedom is the town map where you can choose your next destination. There is no save option.
The freely distributed game is actually just the half of it - you had to request the other half with a codeword found inside the game.
