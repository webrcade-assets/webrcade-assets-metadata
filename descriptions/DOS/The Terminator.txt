This adaptation of the action movie with the same name is a 3D open-world action and driving game. The player takes the role of Kyle Reese and protects Sarah Connor from the cyborg sent back in time to kill her, or becomes the Terminator and attempts to eliminate Sarah and her protector.  Either way, the player chases his opponent through Los Angeles buying or stealing weapons and equipment while attempting to eliminate his enemy and avoid the police. There is only one objective for each of the protagonists, but both can engage in side activities that have no influence on the plot, which includes hijacking and driving cars or exploring the large playing area on foot.
