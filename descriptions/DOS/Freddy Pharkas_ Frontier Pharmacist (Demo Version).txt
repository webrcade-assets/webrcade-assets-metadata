Similar to the Space Quest 6 demo, the interactive demonstration of Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist offers a short scenario that can be played from start to finish, but is not part of the full game's story line.In the demo, Freddy needs to find a way to seal the entrance to an abandoned gold mine where a bank robber is hiding. He can visit several locations from the full game, and interact with some of the characters, providing a sample of the retail version's experience in an original context. Also included is a truncated version of the "Ballad" intro, which lacks the actual singing (in order to shrink down the size of the download), and omits potential spoilers about Freddy's past.The demo was available as a free download from the Sierra BBS.
