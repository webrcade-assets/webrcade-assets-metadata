Conquest of the New World is a game very similar to Civilization in some aspects. Starting the game with a ship, the player will have to land somewhere with their units. There, they need to establish contact with the natives, and can either attack them or start to trade with them, in a similar fashion to Civilization or Colonization.
Controlling the units is rather atypical for this genre, as it is done by dragging an arrow from one unit to where it's supposed to move and it will do so automatically.
