A rudimentary Christian text adventure with a multiple-choice navigational interface, the game puts in the player (following an introductory throwaway prayer to better understand the lessons in the Book of Revelation -- specifically chapters 19:11 through 20:10) in a "Between-Land" neither in this life nor the afterlife, learning special prayers from angels and facing down devils.The player plods along through environments as varied as the Wayside Chapel, an Angel Barracks, the Blackclaw Forest, and the redundant Catacomb Caves, sporadically taking in deeper wisdom from angelic mentors on side-branches or applying that wisdom against demonic tormentors encountered on the main path.  When exploring destinations numerous nuanced navigational options are offered (cardinal directions vs. the standard "Continue on"), but generally only one or two are valid, making this game, narratively, akin to a fixed-rail shooter... only with praying in place of shooting.
