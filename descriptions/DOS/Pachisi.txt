Pachisi is an ancient game thought to have originated in India. Modern western variants include the board games Sorry! and Ludo. The game is played by rolling a dice and moving counters around the outside of a cross-shaped game area. Pachisi is for four players and in this shareware version the computer can substitute for one, two or three of those players. To win the game, a player must be the first to move all of their counters around the board and into the centre.
