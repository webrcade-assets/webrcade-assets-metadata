Mickey's 123's: The Big Surprise Party is one of the educational games in a series of games for pre-schoolers featuring Disney Characters. This game aims to familiarize players with counting from 1 to 9.
Mickey wants to arrange a surprise party for one of the Disney characters chosen randomly with each new playthrough and the player must help him prepare for this party.
The game is controlled by pressing a number from 1 to 9 which influences where Mickey goes, the way Mickey gets to the chosen locations, the things he makes as a present, the food and drinks he gets for the surprise party, which guests he will invite to the party and how much food and drinks each guest would get. Pressing any number will also have the narrator start counting numbers from 1 to the one players pressed while showing some action take place in the game.
