Voodoo Lunch is a side-scrolling platform game that is very similar to Skunny: In The Wild West, and appears to utilize the same engine. The main character, Twiggy, was born in a remote village in Zululand, from which he was banished as the other villagers thought his appearance to be a bad omen. Twiggy can only return if he collects enough treasure to appease the spirits.The game is split into several episodes, each with a different theme. Similar to the Skunny platform games, the player must find and collect all treasure items to complete a level, while avoiding enemies and other hazards. Enemies can be attacked with boomerangs, which are in limited supply, but will respawn after some time.Voodoo Lunch was distributed as shareware, with the unregistered version limited to the first episode, Mine Monster. There are five episodes in the full game.
