Crime Lab: Case Of The Missing Masterpiece is a very short, shareware, educational single player game focused on the forensic procedure of blood typing.
The Acme Art Gallery was burgled on April 1st, 1988 and the thief made off with a valuable painting, hence the title. As a crime lab technician the player's job is to analyse a blood sample. After quite a few detailed screens explaining the principles of the science behind this process the player prepares two reference samples and a sample taken from the crime scene. Based on the results of their analysis they then choose from a suspect list whose blood types are known.
The game is keyboard controlled, has no sound and can be replayed because the culprit changes.
