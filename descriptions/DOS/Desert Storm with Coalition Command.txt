Desert Storm with Coalition Command consists actually of two different programs, Desert Storm and Coalition Command. Desert Storm is the focus of the release and a database about the Gulf War. It cites the complete official report from the Pentagon to the Congress and adds multimedia (sound bites and photographs).More of interest to our own database is Coalition Command which is an educational game about the Gulf War, aiming to give insights to how a war is planned and managed on the command level.The player takes place in a command center and can influence the war effort. If no action is taken, the game assumes a historical course of war. So the player basically can manage the media with press releases; talk to Bush, Quayle, Cheney and Powell on the phone and change unit deployment on the map (limited to four options except for air operations). After the inevitable victory of the US forces, the game rates the player's performance. While the game is serious in nature, vice-president Quayle acts as comic relief.
