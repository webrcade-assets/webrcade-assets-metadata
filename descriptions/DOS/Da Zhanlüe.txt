Da Zhanl√ºe ("Grand Strategy") is, despite its name, a purely tactical game inspired by SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games. This Taiwanese-made game displays strong similarities to the Japanese prototype in overall concept of abstract tactical battles that take place on hexagonal grids. The near-future setting involves a fictional account of events following the dissolution of Soviet Union and the emergence of independent peacekeeping organizations, such as the player-controlled Viper group. As the commander of the team, the player has to place the headquarters on the scenario map and deploy the limited amounts of various troops. These include various types of tanks, infantry, supply trucks, etc. Money is awarded for successfully completing missions and can be spent on purchasing and customizing the troops.
