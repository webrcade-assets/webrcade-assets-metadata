Eco-Adventures in the Rainforest is a first-person educational game for kids. You explore the rainforest and interact with its inhabitants, including many different kinds of animals, poachers, native peoples and more. At the beginning of the game you are given a mission that for the most part amounts to finding some target and taking a picture of it while answering trivia questions and avoiding getting killed. The game comes with a copy of The Rainforest Book by Scott Lewis, to teach kids the necessary facts about the rainforest that they would need to play the game, and to serve as a manual lookup-based copy protection scheme.
