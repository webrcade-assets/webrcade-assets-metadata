The Backyard is an educational game for toddlers that is set in a child's backyard. Everything within the backyard can be clicked on, resulting in an activity, or at least an amusing animation. The Backyard is the third in a trilogy of games for toddlers that include The Playroom, and The Treehouse. Children are presented with activities that encourage development in associating facial expressions with the words that describe them, map reading and making, animal identification, and of course, numbers and letters.
