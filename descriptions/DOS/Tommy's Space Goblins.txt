Tommy's Space Goblins is a single player DOS game.The player pilots a lone space ship that's somehow got lost and has stumbled into a nest of space goblins. This is really bad news because goblins eat space ships.The player controls the space ship with the numeric key pad and fires a proton beam to kill the goblins.The goblins, which look like large houses, advance from the right of the screen. The goblins advance across the screen leaving behind a multi-coloured trail as they move leftwards. Other goblins following in the same, or similar, tracks over-write the trail of their predecessors but become increasingly difficult to spot.The player has a proton beam on board their ship and must kill the goblins in order to survive, only a shot between the eyes will do the trick. Contact with a goblin ends the game.The player has one life to score as highly as possible.The game has nine levels of difficulty and maintains the top ten high scores for each difficulty level.
