Sexy Droids continues the idea started in Blue Angel 69, which combines the principle of Maxit with pictures of sexy female androids. Now, there are 15 levels with new pictures. The player takes the role of person who plays a boardgame with an android. If the player wins, an exposed picture of the opponent is displayed.The gameplay of each level takes place on a 8x8 board. Each tile on the board contains a positive or negative point value ranging from 1 to 11. The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible by moving a marker to a non-empty space taking turns. The first player is only able to move the marker horizontally, and the second player can only move the marker vertically. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the most points wins.
