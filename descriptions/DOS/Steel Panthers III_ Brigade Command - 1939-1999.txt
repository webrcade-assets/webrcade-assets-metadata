Steel Panthers III is the third in the Steel Panthers series, which chronicles the exploits of tanks from a top-down hex-based setting. As the full title suggests, the time frame of Steel Panthers III covers World War II, the post-war era as well as hypothetical conflicts set in (then) near future.This time, SSI changed the scale slightly to allow larger battlefields and unit command structures, with improved leaders and command interface. Otherwise, this game isn't much changed from Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles.
