McGee at the Fun Fair is the third game in the McGee series. Like the previous two games it is an educational game for young children that is entirely wordless so that it can be played by the child alone without any help from a parent. The gameplay is identical to the previous games but this time McGee has travelled to a fun fair and along with him comes a friend called Tony. The fair consists of a few different locations and for each there are four icons to click on that cause the two characters to interact with the environment in different ways. This includes watching the various entertainers (a clown, a juggler and a one man band for instance), having fun on the playground and eating ice cream. The game does not have an end sequence so the player can explore the locations freely for any length of time.
