You are Oliver, a cat from the Disney movie Oliver & Company. The game is a 3rd-person arcade scroller.
The plot is the same as in the movie. Oliver is a homeless kitten who teams up with a gang of dogs and their poor but good owner in New York. You control Oliver through mouse and keyboard and you move around in various places such as the dog gang's home, New York streets and a mansion belonging to Jenny, a kind rich girl. You must score 1,000 points to get to the next level. You score points by collecting hot dogs on the street and by catching flying dog biscuits.
