Alien Alley is a vertically-scrolling, top-down shooter. The player controls a spaceship which uses its gun to blast alien ships for points. These enter the screen from the top and shoot downwards. Being hit by fire depletes shield energy,  and touching an enemy results in instant death. The goal is to survive as long as possible and accumulate as many points as possible for the high-score list.
Originally programmed as an in-depth programming example for the book PC Game Programming Explorer (which includes the source code on a covermount disk and as listing), it was also released for download to promote the book.
