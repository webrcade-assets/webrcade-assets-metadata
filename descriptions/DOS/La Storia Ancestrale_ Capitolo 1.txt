The Ancestral Trail is a series of fantasy novels published as a 26-volume partwork magazine during the early 1990's. Its publisher for Italy, where it was titled " La Storia Ancestrale", also made a video game adaptation as four separate standalone games sold as periodicals, as an early example of the episodic video game model.
The game follows the story of a young boy named Richard, who is magically transported to a fantasy world. There, a man named Golan recognizes him as the Chosen One who is set to restore balance in the world. Richard is tasked with retrieving six lost gems, each held by a guardian at the service of the Evil One.
La Storia Ancestrale is a point-and-click adventure game on fixed screens from a two-dimensional side view. Left-clicking on an object or exit causes Richard to walk there, right-clicking will have him look at the object, whereas left-clicking while holding the right button will perform a default action such as pick up or talk. There is a single "use" verb for objects in the inventory, which varies in effect depending on Richard's location. Occasionally, Richard will have to fight monsters in an arcade sequence with a crossbow.
