This turn-based strategy game may be played against the computer or another human player (either in a hot-seat fashion or via modem). Each side starts out with a starbase, a bunch of ships, some cash, and one simple objective - total annihilation of the enemy.Various ship types are available, from lowly scout to mighty destroyer, and each has its own stats: hull strength, energy, shields, scan range, the number of weapon bays, and moves per turn (firing a weapon counts as a move, too).  The map grid is comprised of different sector types, some with associated astral phenomena that may help you, hinder you, or just throw you off course.  Planets may be exploited for resources to bolster your treasury, and the starbase commissions new ships and performs hull repairs; additional fixes and upgrades (weaponry, shields and energy storage) can be found on trading planets - for the right price.Two opponents playing over a modem connection can communicate using the text chat option.  For single players who are feeling talkative, the game provides digitized voice feedback for pretty much any action... or lack thereof.
