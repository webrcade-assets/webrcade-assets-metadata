Heroes in Heroes is a Chinese point-and-click adventure game based on the classic book Water Margin, set in the Song Dynasty, ancient China. The game's point-and-click control is very straight forward, you right click to switch actions (walk, talk, take/action) which are executed by left clicking. Hotspots in the game are not visible so that you need to observe and guess what to click on, while the surrounding environment doesn't contain many clickable items. The conversations and monologues in the game are written in a very ancient-Chinese style.The game is divided into six independent episodes, but grouped together in a single game, similar to the structure of I Have no Mouth and I Have to Scream. In each episode you control a classic character from the book, experiencing six different stories, dealing with tough situations and making their own way out.
