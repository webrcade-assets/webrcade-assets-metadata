2112 is a single-player text adventure. The story is based on the song titles on the album 2112 by the band Rush. It is set in a futuristic state where life is strictly controlled by the priests of Syrinx. All individuality is suppressed, art and music are outlawed then one day the player finds a strange device. The game asks for the player's name at the beginning and uses that name within the game. It has multiple endings, many ways to die and at a few key points a short tune is played.
