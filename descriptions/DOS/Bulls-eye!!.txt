Bulls-eye!! is a shareware archery game for one or two players. The left and right arrows are used to aim an arrow at the target and then the Enter key needs to be pressed to fire the arrow. Aiming is complicated by the wind which blows from left or right with varying intensity, and by draft which deflects the arrows up or down. After compensating for the wind the best time to fire is when there is little or no draft but in this game the this changes rapidly so timing of the shot is essential. There is no end to the game, it continues until the player(s) select either a new game of choose to exit.
