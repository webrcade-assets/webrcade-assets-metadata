This catch-the-falling-objects game uses almost the entire keyboard for its controls.  An assortment of ASCII characters is raining down from the sky, and your job is to catch as many as you can: each column of the screen is marked by a letter or a number, and you can instantly move your basket to any position on the floor by pressing the corresponding key.  The various symbols have different point values, but you're only allowed 21 misses, so they're all equally important to catch.
The game can be played in 40 or 80-column modes, and offers four difficulty levels.  When the game is over, you're awarded with a short interlude from the speaker, depending on your score - and if you were good enough, the computer will adjust for your skill by making each level twice as difficult!
