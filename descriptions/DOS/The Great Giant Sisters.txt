The Great Giant Sisters is an unofficial DOS port/recreation of The Great Giana Sisters. It uses Amiga version style graphics and sound effects, and recreated Commodore 64 soundtrack. While the game relatively accurately reproduces the core playing mechanics, the items which grant Giana additional powers are not implemented, resulting in a different style of gameplay compared to the original Giana Sisters. The layout of levels is also not the same.
