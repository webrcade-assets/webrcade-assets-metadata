A plague of Space snakes wants to reconquer the Mars Planet. In the role of a brave spaceship pilot, part of the defence line of the planet, the player must resist the attack of ten hordes of these violent monsters. Each horde is stronger than the previous one. The player has only 5 spaceships to vanquish the attack of the space snakes.The gameplay is very simple. Our ship only can move in the horizontal axis (like "Galaxian"), and players must destroy all the Space Snakes, while avoiding the enemy assaults.
