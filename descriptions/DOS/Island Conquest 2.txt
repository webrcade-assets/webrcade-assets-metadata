In Island Conquest II you start out as the sibling of a sailor who washed ashore many years ago in the first Island Conquest. Your father found twelve tribes, engaged in war. Under his leadership the tribes were reunited. After his retirement and with the absence of a great leader, the tribes are now at war again. It is up to you to reunite the tribes once more by conquering the other villages and islands.
Island Conquest II is a turn-based strategy game, in which you have to 'produce' and train warriors in order to be able to attack other tribes. You also have to gather wood to upgrade your village, and gather food or everyone will die of starvation. Once you have conquered all villages on all islands, you will have reunited all the tribes, and the game ends there.
