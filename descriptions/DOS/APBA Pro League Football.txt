APBA Pro League Football is a digital adaptation of the board game bearing the same name. This software enables users to simulate American football leagues by loading season data disks (which come included with the purchased version or can be bought separately). Editing leagues or teams, as well as drafting players, is only possible through the acquisition of add-on disks.
The interactive gameplay focuses exclusively on field tactics, such as calling defensive or offensive plays and making substitutions. Visually, the game provides a top-down view of the field, with only the ball position marked. Play descriptions are conveyed through text.
