Astro Blaster is an unofficial adaptation of the fixed-screen shooter Astro Blaster. The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right at the bottom of the screen, battling waves of enemies. Fuel is limited, and excessive weapon use causes overheating, rendering it temporarily unusable. The spaceship also has limited time warp abilities, slowing down enemies. Surviving a wave, either by shooting down all enemies or dodging them and their laser shots, triggers the next wave. The game continues until the player loses all lives.
