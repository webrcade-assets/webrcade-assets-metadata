She Bo is a Chinese-made clone of Pang/Buster Bros..
As in the original game, the goal in each level is to destroy a number of bouncing balls with a hook cannon. When hit, the balls split into two smaller balls and are only destroyed when already at minimum size. Being touched by any of the balls means losing a life. Some levels feature barriers the balls bounce off of (some of which can be destroyed with the hook), others feature ladders the player character can climb. The game is for up to two players; the second player can join in at any time.
The game's levels are actually direct copies of those in Pang, but with background images of dinosaurs instead of the world's landmarks as in the original. The distribution of power-ups however is different.
