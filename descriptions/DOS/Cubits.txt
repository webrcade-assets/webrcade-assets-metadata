A fast-paced game played on a series of abstract, isometric grids within a cube. Each cube has three levels - the objective is to transfer all the cubits (red tiles) to the next level, through the elevators in the corners. They are manipulated by flipping, kicking ( Pengo -style), or pushing them around ( Sokoban -style). Once they're all cleared away, you take the elevator yourself and emerge at the next level.
This has to be done before time runs out, and to make your life harder, the wandering "time-wasters" will take precious seconds off the clock if you bump into them; you can temporarily get rid of them by squashing them with tiles. Special bonus squares appear and disappear at random, and if you collect six of them you'll gain some extra time.
