RedCat: Rekenen - De Razende Rekenrace is a educational racing game teaching children between the ages of 6 till 12 about math.The game has several different modes through wich players learn other sets and skills of math. The first game mode "Wat is waar" (what is true) learns children to quickly predict the outcome of a math problem. For example 5x5 = bigger than 22, true or not true? The second game mode "Memory met sommen" (memory with math problems), where players do a game of memory, but math-themed. The Third mode "Handig rekenen" (efficient calculations), is where players learn how to efficiently calculate something. For example: 3x400 can easily be calculated by doing 3x4 and then putting two zeros at the end. And last but not least is the mode "Grote getallenspel" (big calculating game), through which players learn calculating in a creative way.The race is top down and features RedCat trying to beat other NPC controlled vehicles. Solving math problems gives the player new bonusses for this race. Players can race on 6 different tracks.
