Main Battle Tank: North Germany is a computer wargame for multiple systems, covering a hypothetical war between NATO forces and the Soviet Union during the late Cold War.  It also contains an alternative scenario where Germany is a neutral power that may face Soviet or NATO invasion.Players can control the NATO and/or Soviet sides, or the computer can take on one or both roles. The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units. There are a total of seven scenarios to choose from for each game option, and the player can also create custom scenarios. The player takes on the role of scenario commander, and issues orders to different units. Groupings may or may not follow commands, and messages and reporting may become skewed to represent fog of war.The player receives a limited weather report each turn, and gameplay progresses in 15 minute segments. Each turn units can report in to give their current condition. Every 15 minutes, the player can either request a general report or give orders to groupings. General report provides the current location of each company, and their current level of engagement. Individual groupings can be ordered to report, move, advance, attack, retreat, screen, hold, or special orders (artillery or engineering).  The player can also order air raids on enemy positions.
