Eat'em II is a single player, Pac-Man like game.As with Pac-Man the player navigates a maze eating food to score points and they are chased by ghosts. Unlike Pac-Man the maze is much larger and extends beyond the screen in all directions. Another twist is that instead of eating a power pill and then being able to chase down and eat the ghosts as in Pac Man, in this game the power pill gives the player the chance to shoot their enemies.
