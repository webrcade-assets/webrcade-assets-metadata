Blake Stone: Planet Strike! is the commercial sequel to Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold.An evolution rather than a revolution, Planet Strike! doesn't dramatically change things and features everything from the original game except the elevator. In the place of the elevator, the player must now collect a bomb on every map and bring it to a security cube; the bomb will destroy the cube allowing the player to use the exit.It features 24 new levels, played in a single episode in a linear fashion (despite a between level map trying to convince you otherwise), a new weapon, the Plasma Discharger (which functions as the game's ultimate weapon), and several new bad guys and bosses.Though the "new bad guys" comment is a little misleading as only one of them is actually all new; the others are the boss aliens from Aliens of Gold (with their stats reduced to non-boss level) or simply slightly edited and re-coloured bad guys from the previous game.
