SimRefinery is an educational game made for Chevron industries that aims to learn the ins and outs of refineries. The game features little in means of build options, but there are introductory tutorials and random events included. Some buildings can be placed, but only in preset areas. The interface focuses heavily on tweaking sliders and managing budgets and acts as an educational reminder of how complex (and important) the essences of running a refinery is.
