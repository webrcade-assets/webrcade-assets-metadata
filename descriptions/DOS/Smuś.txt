Smu≈õ is a platform game. The hero of the game is a small dragon, kidnapped by the Ice Baron. The player must help him escape from the old ruins. There are nearly 250 rooms to complete. In each of them, the protagonist encounters the baron's knights, Indians and birds. The small dragon dies after contact with poisoned water and spikes. An additional complication are the moving platforms and the time limit - exactly 9999 seconds. Blue buttons allow to replenish the dragon's fire attack and open the bars blocking the way.
