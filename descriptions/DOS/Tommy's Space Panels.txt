Tommy's Space Panels is a single player puzzle.
This is an odd, surreal sort of game and may in fact not be a game at all. The player is presented with a series of screens, each one activated by a different numeric key. Each screen is said to represent a control panel from an alien space ship and comes complete with bleeps and flashing bits. That's it! The game's documentation says, "Sorry, but you'll have to figure out the controls all by yourself (try hitting keys and see what happens)".
The game has a Demo mode where it plays all by itself and command line parameters that force either a colour or a monochrome display.
