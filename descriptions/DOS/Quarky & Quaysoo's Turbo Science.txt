The indian-originated space elf Quarky O'Ghandi and his sister Quaysoo organized a team Los Turbos to beat well-known Das Liquidators, Cool City Maulers, and Valiant Cube. Answering correctly on questions, you as member of Los Turbos must earn money to move between checkpoints, and to win a race. Movement between check points can be done using five different means of transportation. Each of them has its own price and time needed to reach the checkpoint - those cheaper are in most cases slower. A several won races raise your rank and add chances to win a Turbo Science championship.The game has a very educational aspect. In each checkpoint the player has to deal with different physics terms and questions. There are two difficulty levels of question depending on the player's knowledge and experience. The game has also a strategy aspect - earning more money on earlier, easier levels may be crucial to the whole race. The player does not have to take questions at every checkpoint as long as he has money to continue the race.
