H-Tron is a traditional light-cycle game written in Turbo C, and aimed at IBM PCs and clones with monochrome (Hercules-compatible) graphics. Each of the two contestants can be controlled by either a human or the computer - a machine-vs.-machine demo mode is available too.
As always, the formula involves two TRON-style light-cycles that leave deadly trails in their wake, trying to encircle and trap each other. Crashing into such a trail (or into the arena walls) spells death for the hapless cyclist, and earns a point for the opponent. The first player to win five rounds is the victor.
