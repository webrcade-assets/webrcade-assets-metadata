The Daily Telegraph Computer Crossword Challenge is a computer adaptation of crosswords published in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. There are forty crosswords included, with the suggested target time limit for solving each one set at 60 minutes. The clues displayed for words are rather vague, and there is a cheat mode that allows to see an answer at the cost of 15% penalty of the target time, as well as the Scribble Pad for anagram analysis. There is also a penalty of 10% of the target time for each incorrect solution entered.
