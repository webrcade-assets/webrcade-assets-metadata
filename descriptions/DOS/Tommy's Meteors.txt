It's you versus the meteors in Tommy's Meteors. Try to survive a barrage of meteor showers and rack up the points in this simple arcade game. The meteors fall from the top of the screen and you must dodge them by moving your character around with the keyboard. You can move anywhere on the screen you wish.
Your only defense against falling meteors are the bunkers. But everytime you walk through a bunker you will clear a path through it, weakening your defenses. If you last long enough a new bunker may replace a weakened one but with the drawback that it will crush you when it arrives. The meteors will leave behind them a line of radiation and you must avoid these as well since they will subtract from points you've earned. The longer you last the higher the points you'll get.
