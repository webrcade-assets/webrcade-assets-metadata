Segyun-jeon 95 is a follow-up to Segyun-jeon. Like its predecessor, it is a board game similar to Reversi, where opponents place colored blobs on a grid in at attempt to surround enemy blobs and convert them to their own color. The game has three modes: one player versus the computer, two players, and training. Unlike the first game, there is time limit for stages. There is also more variety in stage design and starting positions, and new features including neutral green-colored blobs and inaccessible squares.
