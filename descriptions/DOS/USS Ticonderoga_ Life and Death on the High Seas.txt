USS Ticonderoga lets you command a Ticonderoga-class missile cruiser in a real-time naval combat simulation. There are three theaters of operation: the Persian Gulf, the North Atlantic or the Sea of Japan and you will have to take your ship there and try to keep the peace and carry out your missions.
