This is the first game in the Rally Championship series. Network Q RAC Rally, as well as other titles, gives you an opportunity to participate in a long-running British rally championship.
To do so, you can choose one of the five cars: Toyota Celica, Ford Escort, Lancia Delta HF Integrale, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Subaru Impreza. The only customizable thing here is the tire type.
Controlling your vehicle is rather easy and driving model isn't complex, however, you can damage your vehicle and end your race before reaching the finish line.
