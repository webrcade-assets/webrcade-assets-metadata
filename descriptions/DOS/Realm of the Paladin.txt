Realm of the Paladin is a Roleplaying game for DOS.
The village of East Wood has been overrun by the hordes of the Master Lich, The Dominion.  Newly arriving in town, the Town Elder has become entrapped in ice as he tries to help you.  The player must defeat the Master Lich and free the village from evil.
Played from a top down perspective, the player moves in the cardinal directions.  All game play is via the mouse, and the player can talk to the townspeople and examine items and doors.  When the player visits shops, they can buy and sell items, trade, and talk.  The player has limited faith and health.  These can be restored through magic spells, items, or talking to townspeople.  Faith is used to cast magic spells, while health is drained in combat and it's game over if this reaches 0.
Combat starts when approached by an enemy.  Other enemies can wander towards the player and join in combat.  The player and enemies take turns attacking and casting spells.  The player can equip items and has a small inventory.
