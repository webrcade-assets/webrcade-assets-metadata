It's war. And you are the head of one of three states with one goal: conquer the other states. To achieve this goal you have a top-down look on the map to extend the controlled area in this round-based strategy game.
Every city has a production potential which is based on its industrial level. You can distribute this potential to perform certain actions, e.g. build new troops or increase the social system. The outcome of fights is based on a large variety of factors like terrain - not just the combat strength.
Once per turn you can use your radar to search in the unknown parts of the map to find your enemies.
