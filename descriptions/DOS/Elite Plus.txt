Elite Plus is a VGA remake of Bell and Braben's space trading flight simulator, Elite. It is an updated conversion of the original that features new graphics and sounds/music.
The novella included with this package is different from the one that came with the original Elite releases. This version includes the story 'Imprint' by Andy Redman, which formed the latter part of the manual, while the original Elite included The Dark Wheel by Robert Holdstock as a separate book.
