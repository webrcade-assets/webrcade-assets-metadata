Bert's African Animals is a single player, shareware, colouring game for young children.
This game offers the child the opportunity to create pictures using pre-drawn templates and figures. As each animal is selected its name is displayed in big letters and a voice says its name. The animals come in four different sizes and are dragged into position with the mouse at which point they can be coloured. The game also has a Story function to caption their pictures, a save/load function and a print function.
