Turbo Champions is a straight and to-the-point sports racer: you compete against the clock in a variety of courses, navigating tunnels and sharp turns while avoiding other cars, gas trucks, various road obstacles and the likes. Highlight features include detailed animations for multiple types of slides and crashes, a fast graphical engine that smoothly zooms sprites and text (and scales with CPU power), and a course designer where you create, edit and customize your own tracks.
