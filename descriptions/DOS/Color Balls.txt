Color Balls is a single player, keyboard controlled tetris variant.
As with most Tetris-like games when the player aligns tiles of the same colour they disappear, however in this variant the player only need align three balls of the same colour to achieve this. Also unlike most Tetris games the tiles are rounds when a column lands on top of previous tiles it does not just stand there, the balls roll away making stack building impossible.
