Win/Risk feature: When the player has a win above four credits they can select WIN which transfers part of their winnings to the player's cash pot, repeated selections of WIN are required to transfer all the winnings. The player also has a RISK option which gambles all their winnings in a double-or-nothing bet. Alternatively the player can save some, gamble what's left and, depending on the outcome repeat as often as they can until it has all gone.
A Bonus Grid. There are OK symbols on the reels which seem to act as wild symbols. Whenever they appear their position is recorded on a 3x3 grid at the top/centre of the screen. When all positions have been filled the player has a chance to gamble for a win.
The Accumulator: There are symbols on the reels that look like a wad of cash and whenever they appear on a line the player must gamble. If they are successful then the number of 'wad symbols' is added to a status bar that looks like a green thermometer on the left of the screen. When that bar is full the player is awarded one hundred credits and the status bar resets

All games start with fifty credits and each spin has a two credit stake. There is no save feature and no high score feature however there is a note from the developers which is displayed on exiting the game, this tells the player there is a command line option that they can use on their next game which will preserve their winnings - assuming they have some.
