In this simple game the idea is to shoot the asteroids that are coming towards the Earth. Your ship is loaded with 100 plasma ammos. You'll get more ammo as the game goes on, but not too much so try to spare ammo. The game ends when 10 asteroids have hit the Earth (normally it means when you have run out of ammo..). To play the game you need a mouse. No sounds included. The game uses dos4gw; you need it to play.
