Fly four different campaigns of the World War I. The missions are very different and reach from patrol flights to fast attacks. You'll meet planes like Sopwith Camel, Nieuport Scout, SPAD S.XIII, Albatros D.III or Fokker Dr.I Triplane, to mention a few. The game is for both, beginners and experts as you can individually change the realism model.
