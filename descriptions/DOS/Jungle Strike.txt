Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba Sr., threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge for his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his nuclear weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious drug lord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs.
Because of this threat, the player is hired again to battle these two characters, following their trail in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Comanche, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, they will have to take out their private army, blowing up the enemy with Hellfire missiles, Hydra rockets, or chain guns, using watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships, or pulling off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side.
