Hell On Lemmings II is a multi-player, keyboard controlled game based, surprisingly enough given the name, on the Worms series.
Each player has just one soldier to control and two game modes Tournament and Deathmatch,. The controls and game-play are very similar to the Worms games, walk to position, select weapon, aim & fire - (though mines and petrol cans need to be placed), repeat until there's only one survivor.
Options include redefinable keys, adjustable game timer, 'Mad God' mode, custom colours for the soldiers, optional sci-fi weapons, civilians and sheep.
The shareware version supports just three players, no future weapons and only has the Deathmatch mode, if more that three players want to play the registered version has a tournament mode
