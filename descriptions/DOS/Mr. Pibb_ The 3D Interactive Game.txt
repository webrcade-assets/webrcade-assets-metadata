Mr. Pibb is an FPS game that was distributed by Coca-Cola, and exclusively available at McDonald's.
The games starts on your first day of school. An already stressful day has been made even worse by a mad scientist. He's turned all your school mates into zombies to do his bidding. It's up to you to cure all of them and capture the mad man responsible for this.
You use your belching prowess to spread antidote on your school mates to turn them back to normal. The antidote is mixed in with cans of Mr. Pibb lying around the school. Megaphones scattered around the school turn them back to normal even faster. Your school mates aren't going to sit around while you burp on them of course. They'll attack if they see you, draining your life. If your life runs out, it's game over, and you'll be stuck at school forever!
