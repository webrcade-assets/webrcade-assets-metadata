Following a typical plot for its generation of early text adventures on mainframe, Castle challenges its player to explore a castle, avoiding hazards, in search of 590 points' worth of hidden treasures contained in and around the premises. Standard conventions of the genre's infancy abound, including surprising magic word use for convenient teleportation and an avowedly unmappable random maze, here strewn with some of the author's choicest gags and bons mots from idols and various sources from the mass media.
