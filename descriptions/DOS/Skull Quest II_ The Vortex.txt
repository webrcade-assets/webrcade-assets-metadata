Skull Quest II: The Vortex is a single player, shareware, DOS dungeon crawl game.
The basic story behind this game is identical to Skull Quest I: The Cyan Sarcophagus. Two hundred years ago the player served Lord Trentarus who was a good man. To ensure his reign continued he had his mages build a sarcophagus out of pure wizidrium. By becoming one with this magical device Lord Trentarus would ensure his continued victories over his enemies for eternity. Thus was the Cyan Sarcophagus, the most powerful magical device ever known, constructed.
In addition Lord Trentarus had a large crypt built and he left orders that, upon his death he was to be placed in the sarcophagus and that it and his followers were to be sealed in the crypt. The player takes the role of the soldier charged with the task of sealing the crypt and to guard its doors against grave robbers.
After two centuries a being known as 'The Null Beast' took advantage of the weakness in the ethereal plane that exists around all grave sites and tried to break through into this world from another plane of existence. It was thwarted but it has not given up and now its back again.
As before the game starts with the player, a skeleton with little memory of who he has been, falling into the crypt. There he learns of the new peril from his old companion Skellion and sets out deeper into the crypt to vanquish the beast once and for all.
Skull Quest II was designed to be a tougher game than its predecessor with more illusionary walls and many more objects being hidden or harder to reach.
This game is entirely keyboard controlled.
