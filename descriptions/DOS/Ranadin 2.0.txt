Officially this is an updated version of Ranadinn, but it qualifies as a separate game, since a lot has profoundly changed - much more than the title's spelling. Almost all core elements have been streamlined and stripped down, and many have disappeared completely. Character stats, the use of magic, buying and selling, friendly towns and castles, NPCs, even food and torches: these are all gone. Instead, Ranadin 2.0 focuses much more on combat, with a greater variety of melee and ranged weapons.
The story again places you in Argentan, a group of four islands connected by a "teleportation bridge", which have been invaded by a horde of ruthless monsters. However, in this version, the lands have been completely depopulated - monsters are the only living creatures you'll meet in the dungeons, caves and forests. As before, battle is turn-based, and you gain experience from slaying enemies (which affects your combat prowess and number of hit-points). However, any treasure found does not count as gold; instead, it adds directly to your experience total.
Graphics are in color this time, and the interface is simplified. Saving the game is no longer automatic, but there's still only a single save slot (which overwrites the existing game data).
