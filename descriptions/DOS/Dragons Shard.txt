Dragons Shard is a role-playing game. You have been sent by the king to rid the kingdom of Terradyne of evil monsters, led by Yesmar. To assist you, you should seek out ancient artifacts. This is very similar to the game Stone Mist, but with mouse control.
There are multiple races and classes to create a character with. There is an overworld with various cities, towers, and dungeons dotting the landscape. Random encounters with monsters will occur when traveling. The player can move, attack, switch armor, use items, view a map, enter/exit, talk to a person, camp to regain health, and view statistics. Control is entirely via the mouse.
Dragons Shard was distributed as shareware. The registered version allows characters to go beyond level 5, and explore extra dungeons and towns. A hint book is also available for an extra fee.
