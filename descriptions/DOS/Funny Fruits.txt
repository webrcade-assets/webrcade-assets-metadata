Funny Fruits is a Color Lines type puzzle game. The player must build a straight line, consisting of at least five identical fruits. The constructed line disappears from the board. Each turn brings an appearance of three new fruits randomly located on the gaming hexagonal cell board. After completing the line the player gets fruit juice that fills a 100 ml tube located at the right side of the screen. Filling the tube allows to move to the next level.
