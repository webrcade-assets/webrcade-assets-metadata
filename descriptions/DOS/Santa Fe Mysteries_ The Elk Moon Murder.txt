The Elk Moon Murder is a full motion video adventure game. You take on the part of rookie detective with the Santa Fe police. Anna Elk Moon, a famous native American artist, has been murdered and you have five days to solve the mystery, before "the big boys muscle in", as your chief inspector tells you.The game features a point & click interface. You have eight hours a day, while almost every action you take decreases 15 minutes of your time. Puzzle solving is not part of the game really. Instead you have to listen to the usual suspects, order forensics and shoot photos. Your goal is to come up with an arrest warrant at the end of the game.
