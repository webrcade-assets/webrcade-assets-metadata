Tommy's Nim is a shareware, single-player, puzzle / strategy game for one player vs the computer.This game is based on a an ancient Chinese puzzle. In most versions of the game the loser is the person who removes the last object however this implementation has the option to change this so that the winner is the person who makes the last legal move.Before game starts the player is asked some configuration questions, 'What constitutes a win?' and 'How many rows?'. There can be up to one hundred rows and the player must specify how many objects there are on each row. After all this the game begins and each player takes turns removing one or more objects from any row.The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects, a demo mode and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
