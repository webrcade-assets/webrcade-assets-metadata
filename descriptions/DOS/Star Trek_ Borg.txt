The player take the role of a Starfleet Cadet whose father died in the battle against the Borg at Wolf 359. When the Borg attack again, Starfleet won't allow you to stay and fight them. However, the mysterious entity "Q" (played by John deLancie) gives you the chance to travel back in time to Wolf 359 and try saving your father and his ship.Star Trek: Borg is an interactive movie filmed in first-person through the eyes of the cadet. Q initially takes the player onto the bridge of the cadet's father's ship as an invisible observer. Later, the cadet is transported inside the body of the ship's security officer, where he can use his knowledge of upcoming events to change the outcome.The interface is handled entirely through mouse clicks to make decisions or interact with puzzles at key points during the movie. Players can also pause the movie at any time with a single left-click, and gain access to a tricorder cursor. This cursor can then be clicked on any person or object in the frame to get a Q-narrated description of its backstory or function.
