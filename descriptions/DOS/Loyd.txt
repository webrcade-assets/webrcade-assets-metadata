Loyd is an implementation of the well-known sliding block puzzle game The 15 Puzzle.As is typical in this game the numbers one to fifteen are stored in a 4x4 grid leaving one cell free. The computer scrambles them and the goal is to slide the tiles around until the numbers are arranged in natural order. This implementation allows four players to compete in hot-seat mode to see who can complete the rearranging of the tiles over four rounds in the fewest moves. Each round starts with a score of five hundred points, each move taken costs one point, the player with the highest score wins.
