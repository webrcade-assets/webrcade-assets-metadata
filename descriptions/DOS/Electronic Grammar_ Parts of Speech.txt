Cutesy critters EG (pronounced Eegee) and his friends Blip and the Its are your hosts in this game which, true to its title, imparts knowledge of the English grammar, with chapters covering the different parts of speech - from nouns and pronouns to conjunctions and interjections, and everything in between.  Short summaries of the subject matter are presented, followed by free-response or multiple choice questions: correct answers are rewarded with EG's excited hopping, whereas mistakes will just have him slowly shaking his head (and explaining your error).
Once a chapter is completed, a summary page shows you how well you've done. Two review lessons can be taken to wrap things up - these offer a mixed bag of questions covering several topics.
