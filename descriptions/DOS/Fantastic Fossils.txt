Fantastic Fossils was an educational game title released as shareware in 1991. It had an all-ages theme. The educational aspect offered much information and depth, and the games after each section were used to reinforce what you had learned. It had fossil and bone puzzles, matching games, and classification games. It also had a very detailed "fossil dig" game where you could excavate and preserve your findings like real archaeologists. The Fossil Gallery in Fantastic Fossils was very large and had 200 fully cataloged fossil images in 8 bit color with synthesized audio and sound effects.
