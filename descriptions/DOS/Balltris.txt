Balltris is a Tetris type arcade game. Instead of classic square blocks a cup is being filled with one, two or three balls of different colors. The ball blocks are falling randomly from the top. The player may maneuver the balls by moving them to the left or right and flipping. The balls disappear after creating a chain of at least three balls of the same color.
