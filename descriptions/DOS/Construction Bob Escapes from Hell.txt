Construction Bob Escapes from Hell is the sequel to Construction Bob in the Bouncing Factory. The titular character impulsively jumps into a gigantic hole that has inexplicably appeared, landing him in Hell. Damned by Satan to remain there for all eternity, Bob sets out to make his escape.The gameplay varies between three types of levels, which loop with increasing difficulty. In "Hell's Mine Shaft", Bob jumps upward to the exit while dodging mine carts similar to Frogger. In "Coal Cart Highway", Bob rides a cart along a track, leaping over gaps and obstacles in his path. In "Pitchfork Bridge", Bob traverses a wooden bridge across lava while avoiding killer droplets falling from the ceiling.In each of these stages Bob should also attempt to collect a key; together, these three keys unlock a ruby, 25 of which will allow him to escape Hell. As the game progresses, in addition to the gameplay getting more fast-paced, new obstacles will appear such as hands reaching up out of the lava to grab Bob, or Gargoyles and Satan himself appearing to shoot projectiles at him.
