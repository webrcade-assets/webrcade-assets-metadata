It's up to you to move and rotate the different pieces around so that all the different colored geckos on the outside and inside of the shapes match up. The game's interface allows you to freely rotate around and zoom in and out the scene to see the puzzle from all angles.The game was distributed as shareware with only 1 episode out of 4 available for play.
