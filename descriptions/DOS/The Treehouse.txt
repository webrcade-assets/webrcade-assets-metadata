The Treehouse is an educational title that is set in the location of a children's treehouse. This game teaches toddlers numbers, shapes, letters as well as having a special focus on learning about animals, through various activities associated with items located throughout the treehouse. Clicking on any item in the treehouse will start an activity, or, at least begin an animation.
The game is the second in what became a trilogy of games including the first game The Playroom and finished with the third title, The Backyard.
