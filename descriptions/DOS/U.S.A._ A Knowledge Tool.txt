U.S.A.: A Knowledge Tool is a single-player, shareware, keyboard controlled title with three modes of play. All three options are preceded by a short text screen and use the same map.;* Review the States and their capitals: This option colours a random state red and shows its name and the name of its capital

Test on the States of the U.S.A.: This option colours a random state red then puts a question mark at the bottom of the screen and waits for the player's reply
Test on the capitals of the States: This option colours a random state red, displays the state's name across the top of the screen then puts a question mark at the bottom of the screen and waits for the player's reply

Spelling is important but the player only needs to enter the first five characters for the game to have an answer it can accept. This can still be difficult at first, for example when presented with the state of North Dakota the answers 'North Dakota', 'N Dakota' were rejected as the game was expecting 'N. Dakota'.
The player gets three attempts to answer correctly after which the correct answer is shown.
