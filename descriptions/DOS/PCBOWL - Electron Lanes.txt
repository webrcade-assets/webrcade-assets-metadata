Up to four players can take turns trying to knock the pins down in this straightforward arcade style bowling game. PCBOWL - Electron Lanes gives you control over only the tail end of your roll where you get to use the directional up or down buttons to direct the path of your ball. The ball curves either gently or sharply depending on how long the direction is pressed and will knock down the pins in its path. Due to the simplicity of the program and the lack of pins bouncing around once struck it is impossible to pick up a split. The players also select at which speed the game runs in the beginning, individually or as a group, allowing for more precise control or faster games. Scores are kept by the computer and are displayed after each turn. The regular scoring rules of ten pin bowling apply to this game.
