Total Pinball features the same four tables as its predecessor Pinball Mania, just slightly changed : Kick Off centres around soccer/football, Jail Break is set in a prison, Tarantula reflects Spidersoft's name and logo as it features a rampant spider, and Jackpot is based around gambling.The main difference is the optional presentation of the tables in an isometric 3D view. The second main feature is a recording function to save a played game to the hard drive. During replay, it is possible to watch the game in 3D even if it was played in the 2D mode. Playback is only available from within the game. It ialso offers a monochromatic video mode.Gameplay is the genre standard: Right and left shift for the flippers, space for nudging. The player can set the inclination of the tables, the amount of balls per game (3 to 5) and during multiball (up to 10).
