The aliens have landed... crash-landed, in fact, and they're mighty pissed. Your mission is to investigate their wrecked ship on the other side of the river without being captured by the surviving visitors. For every move you make, the relatively-mindless aliens will make a move of their own in your general direction, in the manner of Daleks or Robots. To thwart your pursuers you're equipped with a limited number of landmines: laying down a mine wastes a turn, but provides an explosive surprise for your would-be abductor. There's also a randomly-placed crate containing some more mines for you to pick up.The mission can be helped or hindered by the lay of the land - a handful of abandoned buildings, and the river itself. You can safely cross the stream; most of the aliens will avoid the water, but some can summon the courage to go for a swim - or even to dive, making their movements invisible.
