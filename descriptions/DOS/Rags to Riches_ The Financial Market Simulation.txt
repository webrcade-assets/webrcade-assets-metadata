You play a young college graduate who has been given a large sum of money by your parents to set up a company. You start in a crummy office on the Lower East Side of town, and as you dabble more in the stock market and make more money, you can take a trip to the mall and buy things from a porcelain dalmatian to a new office. You have to be careful, though- one wrong move with your money, and you end up penniless on the street.
