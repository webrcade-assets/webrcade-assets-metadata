The Vortex Factor is an adventure about time travel. Your journey begins in the halls of a rather large museum. Your goal in this adventure is to find and collect nine (9) treasures scattered through time and put them in the museum curator’s work room. You will move forward and backward in time to achieve your goal.
This graphical interactive fiction game uses standard single letter directions, N, S, E, W, for movement. You can also SAVE your current location on cassette for restarting later. The command parser is a standard verb-noun type (Go Door). Once you have all of the items in the curator’s work room, type "score" - you win if you accumulated 100 points.
