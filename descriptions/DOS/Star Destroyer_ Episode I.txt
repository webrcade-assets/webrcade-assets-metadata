The galaxy has a problem - namely, an evil armada, which rules with an iron fist from its 20 bases in space.  But your Star Destroyer Squad won't have any of that; now the evil armada also has a problem, and that problem is you.  Your job breaks down into three simple tasks: hunt down the enemy patrols, infiltrate the bases, and blow them up; accordingly, each level breaks down into three parts, too.First, you pilot your fighter through space, killing off hostile ships: this you do with your twin lasers, or with your supply of 3 torpedoes that instantly destroy any foe on screen.  Enemy fire will deplete your shields, but they can be replenished if you shoot the floating shield pods.  Once you've vanquished the defenses, you sneak into the base's reactor shaft, and must pilot your ship through while avoiding the tunnel walls.  Finally, you arrive at the reactor core to deliver the death-blow.  If you make it out, you'll live to fight another day... but the enemy at the next base will be better prepared.
