Wazte is a single-player, shareware tile-matching game. Tiles are dropped onto the playing area and the objective is to clear the play area and advance to the next level. Each tile contains two coloured corners and can be rotated. Groups of tiles are cleared from the game area if they arranged so that four adjoining corners are of the same colour. The game has a timer bar and when this runs out the game throws a tile onto the play area, alternatively the player can chose to place the next tile in a beneficial position.The player is assisted by two turrets, The left turret has only one shot and clears five tiles in a cross formation, the right turret has two shots and clears a single tile which is very useful in the closing stages of a level when only one or two tiles remain.
