Sokoban (this version of it, anyway) is a compact implementation of the classic crate-pushing puzzler, squeezing the whole thing into a 1KB executable (with only 256 bytes of code - the rest is level data). Written in assembly and utilizing ASCII graphics, it puts you in the shoes of an average At-sign, attempting to solve levels by pushing the boxes (dollar signs) into their target spots (dots), while taking care not to get yourself (or any of the boxes) hopelessly stuck. There are six levels, identical to the first six in the original game; source code is included.
