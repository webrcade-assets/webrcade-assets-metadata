Squire: The Financial Planning Simulation is a 1-player financial simulation game.
The player starts off with a $70,500 investment at the age of 36, and an initial $500 monthly disposable income. The goal is to maximize the player's personal finances by the time they're ready to retire at the age of 65. The goal is to invest in a variety of sources, including: blue chip stocks, growth stocks, AA corporate bonds, B corporate bonds, IRA, the money market, collectibles, commodities, real estate, oil & gas, and cattle feeding. To help guide their investing, the player can plot the performance of different stocks and commodities, as well as receive updates on possible stock movements. The player can closely watch their investment profile, and sell or buy new investments on a monthly basis. The player can choose to retire at any point they feel their finances are sufficient.
