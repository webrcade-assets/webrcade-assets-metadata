An educational geography quiz game that, as heavily implied by its name, tests players on their knowledge of states and capitals within the USA.  A map of the country is shown, complete with state borders, and on each turn a random state is highlighted.  Depending on the chosen game mode, the player then has to input either the state's name, or its capital's name.  After a series of ten questions, the player is scored according to the percentage of correct answers.
