Blackjack Coach is a 1 - 2 player text-based blackjack simulation and teacher for the Apple II.
Program's goal is to help players optimize and test their blackjack technique against either a human or computer opponent. All commands are via text entry, and has several gameplay options. The game keeps track of the player's win percentage and profit or loss over multiple hands. In manual mode, the player decides to hit, stand, double, or split on each hand without further advice. In coached mode, the program offers advice to the player on how to play. In automatic mode, the computer plays based upon the chosen betting and playing strategy without human input. The computer can perform basic or complete card counting, and the player chooses the number of decks per shoe and how often to receive a report.
