On the Seventh Day is a single player, god-sim from the early 1990's. The game was played on bulletin boards via a BBS Door and required a BBS drop file to be set up on the player's machine.
The premise behind the game is that there are gods, lots of gods, and they battled with each other to see who should rule the heavens. Many centuries of battle got them nowhere so, eventually, they decided they needed another way to decide who was the greatest and this led to the creation of the earth, all its plants and animals, and ultimately to man and woman. The rules of the gods' game were simple.* The victor would be the god who retained the largest number of faithful followers at the end of the game.

As soon as a god had no more followers, he should die.
This would continue until only two gods remained. Then their 
followers would fight on the playing field until one of the two sides were completely defeated.

The game is played by making alliances with one or more gods to defeat an opponent who is then banished to hell. Miracles can be performed to gain more followers which is key because more followers means more power.
