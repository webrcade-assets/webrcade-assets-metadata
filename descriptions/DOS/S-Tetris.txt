The object of this Super Tetris game, as in others like it, is to turn and drop various shaped blocks into spaces in a box, filling up as many rows as possible before the top row is reached. Eliminate rows by filling up all of the empty space as quickly as possible to progress through the levels and get the highest score.In this version, you can control how many different block shapes are available in your game. These are grouped in block sets - Standard has the typical number you are used to seeing in other Tetris games; Extended adds a few more to that; and Professional which provides a total of 15 different blocks.After choosing a set, you will be asked which "zone" (screen) you wish to start playing. Unregistered players are limited to 10 zones, while the Registered release contains over 50 different screens
