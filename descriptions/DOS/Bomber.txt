Bomber is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up where the player flies a B-29 bomber and must destroy three heavily guarded enemy bases. On each level the player must make it through enemy lines to the base which is always 200 kilometers away, the remaining distance indicated in the corner of the screen. The plane can move left and right, as well as accelerate and decelerate. The bomber is equipped with two types of weapons: a cannon to destroy aircraft, and bombs to destroy ground targets such as bunkers and tanks. A red crosshair indicates the location at which the dropped bomb will explode. The player has three lives, and a bonus life is awarded for every 10,000 points.
