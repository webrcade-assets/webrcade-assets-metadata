Adentrator is a horizontally-scrolling shooter. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and must eliminate the invading CyberDoids. The player has control over the ship’s speed, including the ability to stand still or turn around. The primary threat doesn’t come from enemy projectiles; instead, it arises from collisions with large enemy sprites or obstacles, especially when flying at high speeds. A single touch is fatal, and the player has a limited number of lives.As the player progresses through the levels, they can collect power-ups that offer upgrades such as shields or improved weapons. The standard weapon can only fire one shot at a time, and the player must wait until it disappears before firing again.
