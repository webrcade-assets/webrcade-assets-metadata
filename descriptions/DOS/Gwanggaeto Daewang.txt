Gwanggaeto Daewang ("Great King Gwanggaeto") is a historical real-time strategy game focusing on the conquests of Gwanggaeto the Great, who ruled Goguryeo kingdom in the 5th century. There are nine scenarios, most of which reflect the historical events of the time and involve Gwanggaeto's rise to power and his campaigns to subdue the rivaling kingdom Baekje and eventually uniting the Three Kingdoms of Korea (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) under his reign. The gameplay focuses mainly on army management and combat, with a simple icon-based point-and-click interface that allows the player to move units on an isometric playfield and execute commands in real time.
