Kidnapped by aliens, you've grabbed a laser pistol, and run to the exit.
Nocturnal Nightmares starts out in a hallway; as you advance, aliens will appear and need to be shot before they hurt you. After two levels of this, you reach an escape pod, which you need to guide through an asteroid field. This is all that is in the Shareware version. There was an option for registration, but the registered version was never completed.
