Bram Stoker's Dracula is loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. The player controls a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker, who must track down Dracula and end his reign of terror.Unlike the several side-scrolling adaptions of the movie for console systems, this one is a first-person action game. Each stage (three large locations: the cemetery, Carfax Abbey, the castle) follows the same basic formula: Harker has to explore maze-like dungeons and purify all coffins with holy wafers, followed by a boss fight against Dracula in his many forms.Those coffins are also the spots where the killed monsters constantly reappear, as long as they are unholy. Harker has to get rid of the hostile undead by using his knife and gun (mouse is used for aiming). Additional bullets and food (healing) are spread out over the levels ready to be picked up.To reach all coffins and holy wafers, Harker also has to solve basic puzzles which boil down to finding keys and using levers, pressure plates, teleporters and rotating portals. Level maps are tile-based; similar to most first-person role-playing games of the time.
