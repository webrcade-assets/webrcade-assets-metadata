Ulf is a single-player, side-scrolling fighting game in Swedish. It is keyboard controlled, only compatible with a Gravis Ultrasound sound card and allegedly freeware.The game has been found in a DOS compilation, it has no documentation and appears to consist of a single level in which a character can walk left/right and punch people. In truth there is very little to do here, only one opponent was encountered when playing the game, and it is likely that this game was a part completed project that was harvested by a company specialising on shareware collection before it was finished.
