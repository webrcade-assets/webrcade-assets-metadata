Backlash: A Turret Gunner Simulation is a first-person space shooter where the player has control of a turret mounted on a spaceship, that must be defended from attack by other enemy ships, asteroids and other dangers. The turret has a limited number of rockets and a main weapon, which uses the same energy as shields; depending on the case the power level can be assigned to one or another system. Rockets (and other power-ups) can be purchased with credits earned by completing missions.
