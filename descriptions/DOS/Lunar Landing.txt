In Lunar Landing the player gets to take manual control of moon lander capsules, and maneuver them to a safe touchdown on the surface by means of rocket thrust. Each lander starts out with a different bearing and velocity, and a full complement of fuel; the cursor keys apply thrust in four directions to adjust the rocket's trajectory.For a proper landing, it must approach a flat section of the surface slowly enough to stay in one piece. Hit the ground too hard, veer off the screen, or run out of fuel in mid-flight - and the lander is toast. Each successful attempt boosts the level of challenge with a more uneven and dangerous landscape, and larger initial velocities for the rocket.
