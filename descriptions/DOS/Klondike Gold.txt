Klondike Gold is a freeware single- and multiplayer version of Klondike solitaire with several different game modes. The single-player portion is termed Casual Play, while the competitive multiplayer mode is called MatchPlay. While solitaire is by definition a single-player game, competitive play is accomplished by sending out identical sets of six hands to ten different players, and then comparing how well they played by the resulting score. This was done by the now-defunct Klondike Central website maintained by the game's author.The game plays by standard Klondike rules, and the player's score is calculated based on actions taken, such as adding cards to the Ace row or going through multiple passes. Single-player games can be set to follow several subsets of rules, called Vegas and PayGo, and for each mode there is a one-card and a three-card variant, meaning that either one or three cards are removed from the deck at a time during a pass. The game includes extensive built-in documentation that outlines the rules and the differences between the variants.Klondike Gold also introduces a minor gambling element by "charging" virtual gold nuggets for every action, such as starting a new hand, using the undo button or going through "flops" (removing cards from the deck). Successful actions such as placing cards on the Ace row are rewarded with more gold nuggets. The number of nuggets is displayed graphically at the bottom of the playing screen. These rules also differ slightly between the game modes.
