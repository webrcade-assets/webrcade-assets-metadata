Othello is a variation on the board game Reversi and was invented in 1971. Both are turn based strategy games in which players attempt to capture each others pieces.
This shareware implementation is keyboard controlled and has features including colour changes, and a detailed help function. It is a single player game in which the player competes against the computer. The computer player's intelligence, i.e. its 'look ahead' level, can be varied though the developer warns that at its maximum setting it may take months to evaluate each move.
The game has no save function. It does have basic sound effects such as a bleep when the player changes the AI setting mid game and an optional bleep when the computer has made a move.
