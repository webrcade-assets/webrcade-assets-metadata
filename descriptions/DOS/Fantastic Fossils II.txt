Fantastic Fossils II was an educational game released as shareware in 1993. Much like the first FF, it had an all-ages theme. The educational aspect offered much information and depth, and the games were used to reinforce the material. It had fossil and bone guessing puzzles, a dinosaur bone matching game, and a classification game. It also had a very detailed "fossil dig" game much like the first, where you could excavate and preserve your findings like real archaeologists. The Fossil Gallery in Fantastic Fossils II contained hundreds of fully cataloged fossil images in 8 bit color, and had a synthesized audio pronunciator that would say the names of each fossil you were looking at.
