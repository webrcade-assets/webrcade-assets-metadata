Electric Reading Land: The Jimi Learning Experience is a phonics-based reading educational game, themed around Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Jupiter has traveled to the Imagination Space Station because of a distress call. The station runs on imagination, and is nearly out of power. If Jimi reads the station a story, the station will recharge, but there's a problem: Jimi doesn't know how to read. By playing word games, Jimi can learn how to read, which will unlock pages in the storybook. There are also interactive elements around each screen which will play animations if clicked on.
There are three main games: Dino Beach, Dragon Park, and the Phonics Toy. Dino Beach and Dragon Park work in a similar way: a question is asked, and multiple responses are possible. For example, choosing the letters that sound like "at" as in "hat". The questions are voiced. The Phonics Toy lets the player combine starting and ending syllables to create words.
