Fire and Ice is a single player, space shooter.
The player flies their craft over an alien landscape shooting enemy ships and avoiding being shot down. The game takes its name from the fire and the ice phases of the planet's atmosphere. Fuel is a problem as it quickly runs out forcing the pilot to swoop low to the ground to refuel from gas pumps that are dotted on the landscape.
The player has five ships with which to score as highly as possible, one extra ship can be earned by scoring 7500 points. Contact with the ground, cavern wall, enemy ship or being shot costs a life.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled.
