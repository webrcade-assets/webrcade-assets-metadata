Baron Baldric: A Grave Overture is the shareware version of Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure. It includes three levels that are not part of the 10-level registered game. Gameplay mechanics and objectives are the same: the Baron must explore the crypts while collecting treasure, food and flint to maintain sources of light, and avoid various traps and perils, including the wolf-ghost of his ancestor Baron Lazarus.
