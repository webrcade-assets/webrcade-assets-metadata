Word Hunt is a word search game. A list of words will be given, along with a grid of letters, and the player will need to find the words in the grid, hidden in any direction.
This can generate puzzles of multiple sizes (14x14 or 20x20) and difficulties (very easy, words can only go right or down; easy, words can also go up or left; or difficult, words can go diagonally). The game can save puzzles for later, print a puzzle, and can solve a puzzle for you. In addition, you can enter your own word list, and the program will create a puzzle that contains those words.
Word Hunt was distributed as Shareware, but without any missing features.
