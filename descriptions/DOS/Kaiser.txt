Kaiser is an updated version of the 8-Bit game of the same name. The most obvious addition are the graphics: while the original almost entirely consisted of text, here all screens have a drawn background image and mostly also include animations. By clicking on interactive elements, e.g. the city for city development, the player can reach other screens and further settings to change.
While the basic principle of the game has not changed, there are a number of additional features. For example, the city development was extended (now the player also needs to buy houses and military tents) and there are two starting conditions (1700 as noble or 1725 as margrave with more advanced funds and possessions). There are also a number of smaller additions like the possibility to buy/sell trade goods instead of only grain.
