Mavlin: Vesmírný únik (Mavlin: The Space Escape) is point and click sci-fi adventure where the player assumes role of the aforementioned Mavlin. The player controls Mavlin by six graphically presented commands (shoe for walking, ear for hearing etc.). The game features inventory, but the items can be used only on the spots on the screen, not interacted together. The game contains music, but from the PC speaker only.
