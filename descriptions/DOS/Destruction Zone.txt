Destruction Zone is a shareware tank game for one to three players.The game is played in an arena with six players, the human player(s) and robot players. It is entirely keyboard controlled and the keys can be redefined. The story behind the game explains that the tanks are made from three large coloured fuel cylinders that grow dimmer as the tank runs out of fuel which neatly accounts for the simple triangular shapes used to represent them.Games consist of a series of battles, minimum three - maximum ninety-nine, and after every three battles the players get to spend any points they have earned in the shop upgrading their tank. There are five different kinds of tank available in the shop and each tank has seven weapons ports for which there is a wide array of weapons ranging from standard missiles and lasers to the 'death touch' and 'glow shields'.
