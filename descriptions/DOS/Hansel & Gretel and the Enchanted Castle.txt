Hansel & Gretel: And the Enchanted Castle is an adventure game retelling the German fairy tale. In this game, players control Hansel who needs to save Gretel and get out of the candy cottage. One of the objectives of the game is to find Prin, a forest imp who enjoys playing hide & seek and gives players clues where to find him. Finding him a certain number of times will have Prin give Hansel a key to the kitchen, which is necessary to find Gretel. The game can be played in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, French, German and Japanese and players can opt for a bilingual mode to learn new words in each of those languages. There are many hidden entrances and trap doors and clicking on some objects can attract the attention of the witch who will imprison Hansel again once she captures him. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy and hard and changes the locations of objects with each playthrough.
