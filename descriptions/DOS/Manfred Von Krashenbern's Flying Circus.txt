Manfred Von Krashenbern's Flying Circus is a side-scrolling World War I-themed arcade flight game for DOS.
The player controls a British pilot who must make daring air runs over German lines and engage in dogfights with German pilots.  The player starts at the airfield, where they can create a new pilot at the barracks, select a mission, and begin their mission.  Missions can include destroying enemy convoys, destroying observation balloons and zeppelins, bombing airfields, and shooting down enemy planes.
Once in flight, the player can steer up or down, reverse direction, loop, fire their guns forwards, or drop a limited number of bombs.  Bombs can be used to destroy enemy installations.  The screen scrolls in all directions, but a large cliff on the British and German sides of the map prevent the player from flying beyond these boundaries.  The player dogfights with German planes, and must avoid anti-aircraft fire while bombing enemy land targets.  If the player crashes behind enemy lines that character is lost.  A successful mission and landing awards bonus points and potentially medals.
