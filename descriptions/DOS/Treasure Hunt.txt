Try to find the treasures that someone has dropped down on the maze. There are no enemies or any hazards in the game, so you can examine the maze as slowly and thoroughly as you want.
Treasure Hunt is a very simple maze game, but what makes it somewhat special is that it's portrayed in first person perspective (remember that this game was published in 1982). 
The maze is generated randomly every time you start a new game, so there's an endless amount of mazes for a die hard player to conquer.
