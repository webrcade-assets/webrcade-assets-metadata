Bang is a shareware variant of Pang. The player controls Punky, who must destroy all of Dr. Naboulâ€™s gas balloons before they reach Earth. The game is set on single-screen levels, and Punky can move left/right, shoot upwards, and use ladders. When hit, the balloons split into smaller ones, and the objective is to pop all of them to clear the level. Getting hit costs a life (without resetting the level), and losing all lives results in a game over.
Various power-ups drop from destroyed balloons, offering benefits such as extra lives, invulnerability, freezing balloons, and five different weapons. These weapons remain active until the next stage. In multiplayer co-op mode, Punky is joined by her brother.
