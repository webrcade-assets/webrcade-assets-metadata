Commando Enhanced is an unofficial remake of the arcade game Commando. Like the original it is a 2D top-down shooter where the player controls a commando. He has a gun with an unlimited supply of ammo and several grenades, and he must go straightforward and kill enemies along the way way. Turrets can be destroyed by blowing them up.
While most gameplay elements resemble the original game, there are additions such as new enemy types, the ability to pick and use grenades, body armor and other items, and the ability to call in airstrikes.
