Tommy's Tanks is a single-player, shareware, tank shooting game in which the player tackles multiple computer opponents in a single screen arena. Within the arena there are also barriers which cannot be crossed but can be destroyed by shooting at them.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled, has nine levels of difficulty, a high score table, basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
