By the year 2765 Earth has become nearly uninhabitable due to heavy pollution. Humans make a contract with a race of mechanic creatures called Destragon to find a planet and make its conditions suitable for human life. In return, the humans promise to give the Destragon their own land. However, the Destragon betray the humans, and Earth soon turns into a war zone. To make matters even worse, an organization known as Hydra, comprised of the descendants of human colonists, appears on the stage with its own agenda.
A young pilot named Nix crash-lands on Hydra territory, which remains neutral for the time being. Nix must find a way to repair his spaceship and return to Earth, but this seemingly simple quests pulls him into a net of intrigues and conflicts he won't be able to leave behind.
EXP: The Excellent Potato is a Korean-made sci-fi role-playing game. Basic structure and combat system are reminiscent of Japanese RPGs. The player navigates Nix and his party on the overworld, visiting towns, talking to non-player characters, and buying weapons, equipment, and items. Enemies are visible during exploration and can be avoided. Combat is turn-based; some of the characters are able to execute special attacks equivalent to magic, but otherwise fight with equipped melee weapons and firearms that require separate ammunition.
