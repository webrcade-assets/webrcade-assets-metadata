An educational game that taught the player how life started on Earth, how biologists classify life, and how the primordial soup evolved into the first multi-cellular life forms and then simple organisms.It featured two mini-puzzle games with 8bit graphics and sounds. The most interesting part was what I could only compare to a primitive, but still neat little version of the game of life. It let you create simple viruses, bacteria, and amoeba-like organisms using random seeds. You could then watch the items replicate and eat, and eventually die, all in 8bit color and in DOS.
