Tower of Fortune is a first-person party-based fantasy role-playing game which bears many similarities to The Bard's Tale series. The plot revolves around a ruined tower that had been inhabited by a mighty archmage centuries before, and is rumoured to be full of immense treasures. Lured by the prospect of fame and riches, adventurers of all sorts flock to the nearby village of Green Wood to launch their expeditions into the tower.Similar to The Bard's Tale, the game starts at an inn where the player can create characters to assemble a party of up to six adventurers, or use the default pre-generated party. There are seven races and eight classes available, with the choice of a character's class depending on the stats rolled for that character. The village also has several shops to buy supplies and gear, as well as a bank.Movement in Tower of Fortune is tied to a grid, and combat is turn-based. The first-person view of the immediate surroundings is complemented by an overhead map of the area that gets automatically updated as more terrain is uncovered. The game features a day/night cycle with palette swaps for different hours. Shops and other services will be closed at night.As the player explores the game world, encounters with hostile characters and monsters occur, switching to the combat phase where the player gives orders to each of the characters every turn. Defeating these opponents yields experience points and treasure to further strengthen the party.Tower of Fortune was written in QuickBasic and features 256 colour graphics, Sound Blaster sounds and MIDI music by Bjorn Lynne. The released version 1.1 includes the first quest, The Sewers.
