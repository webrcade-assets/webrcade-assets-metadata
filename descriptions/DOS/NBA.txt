N.B.A. is a sports simulation that allows the player to replay individual games or entire basketball seasons, from the past or present, while keeping a permanent record the team's stats using the built in Stat Compiler. In this simulation, the player can re-live the excitement of the famous NBA teams from the 1960's through the the 80's.The game features 20 "all-time great" teams (as of 1987). Game play features 5 on 5 games across three game modes, 1 on 1, 1 vs CPU, and CPU vs CPU. The stat compiler was fairly robust for the time period and tracks steals, blocked shots, assist, rebounds, field goal percentage, foul shot percentage, and time played. The game has managerial aspects to it in that you choose your offensive or defensive play, and then let the computer determine the play.
