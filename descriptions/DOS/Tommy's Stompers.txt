Tommy's Stompers is a shareware single player DOS game.
The story behind the game is that, after having fallen asleep while thinking about the spiders from Mars, the player awakens in a room full of huge pounding Martian anvils and giant spiders.
In the game the player has to move left & right along the bottom of the screen avoiding the stomping anvils which pound up and down, and the spiders which climb up and down their threads. Additionally Martian devils appear and throw the character across the floor, or Martian dogs chase and eat the character.
The object of the game is to achieve as high a score as possible. The player scores one point for every stomping anvil crossed and loses one point for every one they run into.
The game has nine levels of difficulty and records the top ten scores for each level. As the level of difficulty increases the stompers pound faster, there are more spiders and Martians who move faster too.
The game is entirely controlled via the keyboard. The numeric keypad is used to move the players character and the function keys are used to configure the game, change difficulty, toggle sound on/off etc.
