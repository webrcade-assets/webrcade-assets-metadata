The Gold Edition of Tomb Raider adds two new chapters to the original release. The first chapter takes place in Egypt, and occurs several months after the events of Tomb Raider. Lara returns to the city of Khamoon, where she must investigate a hidden temple dedicated to the feline goddess Bast. The second chapter is a prequel to the first, and continues directly the events of the original game, starting with Lara sliding down the slope of the last level, preparing to deal with the remnants of the Atlantean race.
