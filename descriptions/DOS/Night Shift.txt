Night Shift is a puzzle platformer set in a factory owned by Industrial Might & Logic (a parody of Lucasfilm 's special effects company Industrial Light & Magic). Taking control of either Fred Fixit or Fiona Fixit, the player is tasked with ensuring the smooth production of the factory's products, merchandise based on Lucasfilm properties like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, by travelling around the factory line fixing problems and completing tasks.
Gameplay is divided into 6 different kinds of shifts, each with its own assignments (provide power, use wrench to tighten bolts, etc.) The player uses tools throughout the game, and can be awarded with bonus items (hourglass for extra time, cash bonus for extra points).
