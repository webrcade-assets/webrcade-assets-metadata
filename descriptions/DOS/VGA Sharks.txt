In VGA Sharks, play a diver and shoot underwater creatures ranging from ray-bats (mantas), sharks, killer jelly fish [sic], and other sea creatures. The diver may move in any direction, including diagonally to avoid and shoot sea creatures. Shooting a sea creature will reward the player with one point, while colliding with them will result in a bite point, which may stack as long as the diver remains in contact with a sea creature. A shark proof cage or similar cage will be provided at the upper corner screen to protect the diver from the sea creatures.
