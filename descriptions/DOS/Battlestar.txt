Bataille pour Sirius is a space based version of the popular game of Battleships. This game was probably given away as a magazine covermount game. This game is played entirely with the keyboard and can be played by one player against the computer or by two players. Players take turns to place their five space ships and then take turns to hunt down and destroy an opponents vessels.This game gives the players a missile which takes out a single cell on the battle grid, a plasma weapon which takes out three adjacent cells in a row - the target cell and one either side, or an antimatter weapon which takes out a 3x3 square centred around the target cell. Supplies of the plasma and antimatter weapons are limited though they do slowly renew as the game progresses. The players use the arrow keys to move a targeting cursor around the screen, they then select the weapon they wish to fire and press enter. If the shot misses the cell is turned grey, if it hits an enemy ship then all affected cells in the vessel's silhouette turn mauve.
