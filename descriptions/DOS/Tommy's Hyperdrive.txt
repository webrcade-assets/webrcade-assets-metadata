Tommy's Hyperdrive is a single player DOS game.
In this game the player controls a star ship and must navigate through a hyper maze. The player starts in the bottom right hand corner of the maze and must navigate through to a gap in the game's border that's over in the top left corner.
The ship is controlled by the numeric keypad and can move up / down, left / right. The maze is very congested and it is hard to find a way through. Fortunately the ship has a supply of missiles with which the obstacles can be removed.
Unfortunately new obstacles appear at random around the screen so a clear path can sometimes become blocked. Additionally some obstacles reflect the missiles back onto the ship and destroy it. The numeric keypad cannot move the ship when it is faced with a returning missile but there is a 'get out of jail' key and that's F10 - the 'Panic Reverse' button. This will take the ship part of the way back along its current track and if its turned at least one corner recently then the missile will sail past.
When the player completes a level they are treated to an animated hyper drive acceleration & deceleration sequence before starting the next level. The whole game comprises nine levels.
