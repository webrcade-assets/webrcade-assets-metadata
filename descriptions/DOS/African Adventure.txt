African Adventure is a text-based game with no sound or graphics. It is a remake of African Adventure: In Search of Dr. Livingston for the Commodore 64 by Softside in September 1980. You play a man who must help search for a man named Dr. Livingston who has become lost somewhere in the darkest parts of Africa. For every action you type, all the letters must be capital, and your statement can only be two words; a verb and a noun, such as "GET BOOK" or "GO EAST". For directions you can also just enter the first letter of the word like "E" for east.You earn points for the objects you collect. Some have to be used in other locations, or should be held onto as the game proceeds. Several helpful commands include "HINT" in case you are stuck, "LOOK" to tell you what is around you, "I" will show your inventory and what you are holding, "SCORE" shows how many points you currently have, "SAVE" to save your current game progress, "LOAD" to load a saved game, and "QUIT" end your game and display your total score. All commands should be entered in capital letters in order for the program to understand.
