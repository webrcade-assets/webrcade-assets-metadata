Afghanistan is a turn-based strategy game set in Afghanistan. The player controls unnamed forces that have to capture four cities: Herat, Kabul, Maimana, and Faizabad. These cities are defended by equally unnamed forces. The player wins when all cities are conquered, but they lose if either all their units are destroyed or the time limit is not met (one city must be captured by week 6, and then another one must be conquered every two weeks).
The game begins with the player choosing the difficulty level (ranging from 1 to 3), the number of units (between 22 and 35), and how many of those units are missile units. There are 2500 points available, and each regular unit costs 65 points, while each missile unit costs 50 points. The player must allocate between 2200 and 2500 points; any remaining points can be invested in reinforcements during the game.
During each turn, the player selects a unit and moves it directly on the map. Units automatically engage in combat with enemy units (which remain invisible until encountered) or cities. After all units have been moved or the turn has ended prematurely, the enemy makes its moves, and the next week begins. Captured cities are removed from play and are no longer at risk of being recaptured.
