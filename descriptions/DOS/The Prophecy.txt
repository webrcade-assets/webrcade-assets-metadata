This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting in which the player acts as a wizard called Ween, deemed to be "good", taking on a less good one. To fulfill the titular prophecy the wizard has been given a limited time of three days during which he must go on a quest, solving various puzzles along the way, to be rewarded with three grains of sand, that he must place in an hourglass what eventually will result in killing an evil wizard. Objects around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and the challenges quick to comprehend.
Like the company's Gobliins Series, the interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient puzzles than other traditional adventures. The game experiments with the toning of the graphics, using a faux-sepia style outside and some bright colours inside, which changes the atmosphere somewhat. As one of not many titles of those days, two times during the game, the player makes a choice of taking one of the paths which results in different puzzles to be solved.
