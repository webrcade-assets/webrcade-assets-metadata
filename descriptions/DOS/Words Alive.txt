Words Alive is an educational game teaching reading, writing, and time telling. It has three modes.
In See-N-Spell, a word is displayed underneath a picture of the object in question, and the player is asked to spell it out. Once successful, the picture will animate. Difficulty can be set by having some letter filled in already, and by allowing entering letters in any order or requiring that they be entered in order.
In Read-N-Match, a word is displayed, and the player is asked to select the matching picture from three options. Once successful, the picture will animate. Difficulty is only changeable by changing the word from upper to lower case.
In Time-N-Spell, the player is asked to select the displayed time on an analog clock. Each correct answer reveals a letter of a word. Once the entire word is revealed, a picture of that word animates. Difficulty is set by allowing times on the half-hour, the quarter-hour, or the five-minute mark.
See-N-Spell and Read-N-Match allow adding a timer. All modes feature digitized voices and music.
The game was distributed as Shareware. The registered program has a larger dictionary of words.
