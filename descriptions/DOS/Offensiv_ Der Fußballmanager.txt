Offensiv - Der Fußballmanager is a managerial soccer simulation. It offers all typical aspects of its genre: Buying and selling of players, setting the training values, merchandise, extension or new build of the stadium, statistics and newspaper reports. The main menu is a photo of a viewer's terrace where the under menus are reached by clicking on the right spots. The matches are completely shown in an isometric view and the player can give tactical orders during them.
The special gimmick of the game is that it is only possible to coach one team of the German soccer league Bundesliga. The game is sold in different versions for each club. The only difference between the games are the licensed clubs, background graphics and some digitalized photos. The available clubs are FC Bayern München, FC Schalke 04, Hamburger Sportverein, BV Borussia Dortmund, Fortuna Düsseldorf, Arminia Bielefeld, 1. SC Göttingen 05 and Borussia Mönchengladbach.
