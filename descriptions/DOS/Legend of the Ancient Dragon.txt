The land of Lotland, inhabited by many different races, was once threatened by the giant dragon Pursival. Five heroes - Gelman, Moss, Loslorien, Lutania, and Metara - joined forces to defeat the beast in the Last Dungeon of Grun, each earning a kingdom for themselves as a reward.
Many years have passed, and the king of Gelman ordered an extermination of the Dark Elves. Unbeknownst to him, two of them have survived and sworn revenge against the entire Lotland, claiming the power of the vanquished dragon. Blade, the young Knight Prince of Moss, must find companions among dwarves, elves, and humans, in order to venture into Grun once again and put an end to Pursival's might.
Legend of the Ancient Dragon is a Korean-made role-playing game in predominantly Japanese style. The player navigates a party of heroes through overhead environments, encountering non-player characters in populated areas and fighting enemies in turn-based combat. Each companion belongs to a defined class and has access to different weaponry and magic spells.
