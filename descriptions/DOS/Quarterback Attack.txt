In this semi-FMV game, you play a rookie facing his first game as starting quarterback on a fictional team, and this just happens to be The Big Game.The entire game consists of this confrontation. When starting the game you watch a video of a kickoff and return, and then you get to select among 110 plays (100 passing and 10 running). The meat of the game is on the passing plays, where you are switched to a 3rd person behind-the-quarterback view from which you can see oncoming rushers. You can also zoom in on any receiver and via a targeting cursor make passes, or scramble if you don't find an open man.Graphics consist mostly of FMV and super-imposed digitized images of no more than 320 x 200 pixels in resolution. There are also 6 difficulty settings to choose from.
