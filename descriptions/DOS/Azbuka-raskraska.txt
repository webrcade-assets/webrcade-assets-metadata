The game represents a coloring book for young painters, who are getting familiar with an alphabet and digits. Accompanied by a funny bee, the player can use any of the rainbow colors, black/white color, or any color shade mixed in a palette. Already painted images are restored with next game run, but any of them can become colorless with manually applied eraser. Originally localized for Russian alphabet.
