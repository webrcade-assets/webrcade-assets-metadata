Swords of Glass is a simple CRPG probably inspired by Wizardry. You begin in a simple (text only) town and create a wizard or a warrior. After equipping your character at the store, you descend into the single 8 level dungeon located apparently somewhere nearby. As you progress and become more powerful, you will be able to plumb the deeper depths of the dungeon. If you prove your worth many times over, you might just find the Sword of Glass.
