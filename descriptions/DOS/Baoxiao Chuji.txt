Baoxiao Chuji is a Taiwanese-made side-scrolling shoot-em-up. The game takes place underwater most of the time and takes a decidedly "kid-friendly" approach by replacing baddies with cute-looking monsters like octopus, clams, and other deep sea denizens. The player pilots a cute toy craft, complete with the huge winding mechanism in the back.
