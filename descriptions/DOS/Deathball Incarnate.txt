Deathball Incarnate is a game where the player controls a magical orb. The player is tasked with collecting human souls in order to transcend to the revered deathball status. There are three orbs to choose from, each with a different special power. The player rolls the ball left and right in order to roll over and pulverize humans. Each level consists of humans to kill, puzzles to solve, and obstacles to overcome. A second player can play by controlling the movement of the humans.
