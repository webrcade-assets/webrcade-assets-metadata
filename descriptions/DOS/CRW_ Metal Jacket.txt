CRW Metal Jacket is a mecha strategy game set in futuristic Japan. You command a group of well-armed soldiers through a series of missions, from infiltrating a drug lord's mansion to assassinating the leader of a coup. The game proceeds in real-time, but you can pause the action at any time to give orders for your soldiers to move or attack. Your units can pilot one of three specialized mechs: Attacker, Defender, or Sniper, and your squad leader Reiko has an exclusive Commander mech. Each mech has a special move in addition to attacking or defending, such as the Defender's Search, which reveals a small area of the map from the fog of war.After each mission, all of your surviving soldiers earn bonus points, which can be distributed among their stats. If you fail a mission, you proceed to the next, but receive no bonus points, making all future missions harder.The game was released in Japan on the PC-98, then localized for China and Korea on DOS. The game was remade for the PlayStation two years later as the similarly-named CRW: Counter Rebellion War, with controls adapted to the game pad and four additional missions.
