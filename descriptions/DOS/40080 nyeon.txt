40080 nyeon is a horizontally-scrolling shooter with three levels. The player controls a starship which battles opponents by shooting them. Every time the ship is hit, it loses a bar of energy. If all energy is lost, the game is over — unless the player uses the unlimited continue option. Each level also has one power-up which gives a permanent power boost. Before starting the game, the player has to choose the speed (0–4) and the number of energy bars (1–9).
