This game is a conversion of the very popular German board game Mensch ärgere Dich nicht! and uses the original rules.
On a board you play against three computer opponents. Each player has to bring his or her four figures from the start to their home all around the board. The one who manages to do this first is the winner.
The game is played with a dice. Pressing Enter key you start the dice and with another press you stop it. With a six you can bring one of your figures into the game and dice again. Each field can be occupied by only one figure. When you reach a field where an adversarial figure is currently, you throw it out of the board back to the start.
Mensch Ärger' Dich Nicht! is shareware. By registering you don't have to suffer from shareware messages and can play optionally with special fields on which no figure can be thrown out.
