Argh is a single player, freeware, sliding block puzzle.
In this game there are three puzzles: ARGH, BARGH and CARHG, all of which are similar but which differ in complexity. In each puzzle the player starts with a frame within which are a number of coloured blocks. The object in each game is to move block A from its starting position to a specified end position that's on the opposite side of the frame.
There's no sound and no score other than the number of moves taken. The game is entirely keyboard-controlled and has a save/load function and a 'Boss key' that fills the screen with a spurious spread sheet. It has a command-line switch that will cause it to run in monochrome.
Though the game is freeware, the author did sell a version of the game in which the puzzles would solve themselves.
