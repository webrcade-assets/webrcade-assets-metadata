Zig Zag Flag Shag contains ten puzzles in which the goal is to move from the left side of a seven by twelve grid to a specific space containing a flag located off of the right side of the grid. To accomplish this goal, the player can move orthogonally or by using chess-style knight moves. To make things more challenging, the player has a limited number of moves in each direction (which varies from level to level and by difficulty setting). Additionally, some puzzle squares contain stop signs (which force the player to start over) or arrows (which automatically move the player to another square). The game also features synthesized speech through the PC speaker.
