Larax & Zaco is a platform game. Each level takes place in and around a building with bonus items scattered around. To complete a level, the player must collect a certain number of specific items, as well as demolish a certain percentage of the building.For purposes of demolition the player is equipped with several types of bombs. The protagonist can deploy a bomb next to himself, and it will explode after a time, destroying or moving nearby architectonic structures. Destroyed structures turn into rubble which may block one's way, but can be removed completely with bombs. The various parts of the buildings follow the laws of physics; for instance, a bomb detonated next to a column can push this column to the side, causing the floor above it to lose support and come crashing down, thus bringing down also the walls above this floor.The protagonist has a limited amount of health, and loses it when he finds himself underneath falling rubble or comes in contact with roaming monsters (which can be defeated with bombs and leave behind items to collect.) Losing all health makes the protagonist die, and he may respawn when the player wills it. It's possible to destroy the required bonus items with bombs, thus requiring the player to restart the level.Two-player split-screen gameplay is available.
