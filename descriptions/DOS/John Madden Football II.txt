Follow-up to John Madden Football, John Madden Football II improves upon its predecessor with VGA graphics, ADLIB music, and an overall much nicer presentation. The game contains a playbook featuring 80 offensive and 100 defensive plays. And true to the game's pedigree, John Madden himself provides witty commentary throughout the games.
