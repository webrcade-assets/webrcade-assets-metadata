Richard Longhurst and the Box that Ate Time is a humorous point-and-click adventure game. The player controls Richard Longhurst, a garishly dressed individual who one day finds himself in an abandoned zoo without memories of what happened, and afterward keeps being tossed forward and backward in time - all because of the titular antagonist, The Box, whose schemes must be foiled.
The game offers controls standard to games made with Adventure Game Studio: there are several commands - walk, examine, interact, talk - which can be cycled with the right mouse button or with a menu on top of the screen, and there is an inventory where items can be kept.
