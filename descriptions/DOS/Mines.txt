Mines is a text adventure in which the player must explore all "rooms" of a mine and try to uncover all treasure. The game is randomized on each play through with a different map layout, item locations and puzzles. The text parser is very simple as it only understands six cardinal directions, drop, carry and "way out" which gives to direction to go in to go back to the entrance. When carrying the correct item puzzles will resolve automatically.
