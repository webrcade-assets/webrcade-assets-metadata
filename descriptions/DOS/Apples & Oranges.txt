Apples & Oranges is an Othello/Reversi game, only for pawns, it uses... you guessed it - apples and oranges! You can choose one of the sides: Apples or Oranges (Apples always go first by default but this can be changed) and play with the computer or with another player.

The game has optional sound effects, and three levels of difficulty
