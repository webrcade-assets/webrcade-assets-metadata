SplayMaster is a tournament-style space combat game that is reminiscent of the battles in Star Control 2.The game is played by two players (2 human players against each other, 1 human player against computer or, as a demo, two computers versus each other). These players pilot spaceships in 2D space armed with a variety of weapons and defenses.The objective is to destroy another player's spaceship before it does the same to you.
