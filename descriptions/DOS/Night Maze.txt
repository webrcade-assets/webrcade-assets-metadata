Night Maze is a single player, shareware, maze game that is keyboard controlled.
The player starts the game somewhere in a maze. The maze is generated afresh for each game and initially it is completely dark, walls are only revealed as the player explores. The objective is to find one of two exits or make it to the edge and blow a hole in the side with a bomb.
The player starts the game with a fixed amount of health and every move costs one health point and the player's score increases by one point. If the player escapes from the maze the game restarts with the score retained and health points refreshed. Scattered around the maze are additional bombs, potions worth twenty health points, and mystery items that could be either a bonus, a potion, a level, a mode, or poison)
