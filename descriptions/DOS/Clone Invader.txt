Clone Invader is, as one can deduce from its title, a clone of the classic arcade game Space Invaders.Controlling a small space fighter you have to destroy lines of alien ships before they can reach the bottom of the screen, to get points. To complete this task and enter a new level, the player has to stay alive and avoid being shot. You can either shoot the bullets of your enemies or hide behind one of the three rocks.Clone Invader can be played by up to two players (hot-seat, one after the other), either by mouse or by keyboard.
