A single-screen, text-mode take on the BurgerTime formula: your task is to prepare oversized hamburgers by walking your character over the ingredients, which causes them to drop on top of each other, one platform at a time. If you can assemble four finished burgers at the bottom of the screen, you'll be praised by your boss -- and hopefully ascend from Hamburger Hell to Hamburger Heaven.
However, your job is complicated by supernatural intervention: the burger parlor is haunted by a ghost. Perhaps fast-food cosmology also includes a Hamburger Limbo, and this apparition is a former employee who perished in a horrible burger-flipping accident; whatever it might be, it stalks the ladders and platforms at random, seeking to take you down with it. If you fail to evade this paranormal pursuer five times, your kitchen career will be finished.
