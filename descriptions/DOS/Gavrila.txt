Gavrila is a Russian first name of a charming loader, who is guided by the player in order to solve the weighting puzzles in a limited time to gain points. Entering rooms in multi-storey building, Gavrila should put proper boxes on the weighing-machine and apply proper labels to these boxes based on the initial task. There are four weighting trials for each room before making a final decision. The room with puzzle is kept unsolved until the Gavrila's decision is correct. Gavrila can also interact with different objects in the room such as spider web or mouse hole for fun. The progress for already solved rooms is restored for a certain player's profile with next game run. Highest scores are stored in top five table.
