Der Schatz im Silbersee is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.
Based on the novel Der Schatz im Silbersee by German author Karl May, this game let’s you join the wild west adventurers Old Firehand, chief Winnetou and Tante Droll on their way up the Arkansas River, through Utah to the Rocky Mountains. They’re searching for the famous treasure in Silver Lake, but they’re not the only ones: the unscrupulous Red Colonel and his band of tramps aren’t exactly eager to share...
You take control of Old Firehand, performing actions with a set of only three basic commands and a good deal of inventory management. The game features four episodes: the steamer Dogfish, the rafter’s camp, Butler’s farm, and the treasure hunt at the Silbersee. The Eagle’s Tail and Utah chapters of the novel, roughly one half of the book, are omitted. The cast is greatly reduced, too, with neither Old Shatterhand nor any of the companions appearing at all. Knowledge of the book will not give you any advantages, as all of the puzzles are original and often deviate strongly from the events in the novel.
