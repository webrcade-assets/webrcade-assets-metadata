Ultima IV: Part II - Dude, Where's my Avatar? is a comedic fan game featuring the events that take place between Ultima IV and Ultima V.
The game pokes fun at the Ultima series. Mondain, Minax, and Exodus have returned and taken control of the major keeps of Britannia, and replaced Truth, Love, and Courage with Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll.  Lord British has locked himself in his throne room, and the virtues have been corrupted, having been replaced with Intoxication, Promiscuity, Rhythm, Virility, Dancing, Heavy Metal, Partying, and Rehab.  The player has to visit the 8 cities to collect the sigil and mantra for these new virtues.  The player must then enter the 3 keeps and defeat Mondain, Minax, and Exodus.
Played from a top down perspective, character creation is a parody of the original Ultima series, choosing from a number of virtue choices.  The player can pick up and use items, and can engage in conversation with the citizens of Brittania by typing keywords.  The player can shop at the stores of Britannia to purchase items and equipment.  A simple combat system is implemented.
