Super Maxit is a shareware, player vs computer, strategy game.
The game is played out on a board which is divided into squares, there are different board shapes available but they all play the same. Each cell contains a number in the range plus thirty through to minus thirty. The players select a cell and press ENTER to get that number added to their score. The twist is that the player can only select a cell on the current row, via the left/right arrow keys, while the computer can only select a cell on the current column.
The game has an in-game help function, a hint, undo and a cheat function, a demo mode and optional sound.
