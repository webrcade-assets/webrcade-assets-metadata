Podróż po Polsce is an educational quiz game about all the major Polish cities for up to two players. The goal of the player requires travel between 2 designated cities. Each trip costs some amount of petrol, so it's necessary to correctly answer questions about the currently visited city to earn some extra liquid. The player may choose a few destination cities after leaving the current location. The game shows the number of kilometers and amount of fuel needed to reach another destination. If the fuel runs out, the game is over.
