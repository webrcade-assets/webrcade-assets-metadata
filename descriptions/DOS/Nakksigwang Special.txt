Nakksigwang Special is a follow-up to Nakksigwang 2. Visually and gameplay-wise, the game is very similar to its immediate predecessor. Like before, the player first has to select specific locations where he or she would like to fish, and then prepares fishing equipment, choosing between various types of rods, lines, hooks, and bait. There are more diverse locations and new challenges in this release, such as specific equipment and fishing method requirements depending on the type of fish and water (clear, murky, swamp-like, etc.). A fish database is available as well.
