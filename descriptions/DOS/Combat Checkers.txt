Combat Checkers is a variant of American checkers, with single- or two-player mode, but where the pieces have traits from role-playing games to calculate the outcome of the moves.The checker pieces have are portrayed as individuals with arms and armor, which you can buy at the outset of the game, and equip each piece differently.Also the individuals belong to a selectable 'race' like Humans, Elves, Robots and Ogres with different starting strength and resilience values.When jumping over the opponent pieces, the respective piece does 'battle' using the attack/defence values to choose the outcome.The computer can play either with a predefined set of pieces, equipped by the human player, or it can use its own selection, which makes it harder for the player.The player can configure and save various piece/equipment setups for use in other matches, or play with a predefined set.
