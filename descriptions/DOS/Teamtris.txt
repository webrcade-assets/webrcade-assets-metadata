Teamtris is a 1â€“2 player Tetris variant. In one-player mode, the board can either be small (10 columns), or large (25 columns), but the rules are familiar. 2-player mode can be played in competition mode (two 10-column boards that don't interact; The game does not end when the other player loses, so you can continue attempting a high score) or in team mode. Team mode, as you might expect from the name, is the actual point of the game. Two players will play on the same 25 column board, at the same time, maneuvering their pieces around each other.
