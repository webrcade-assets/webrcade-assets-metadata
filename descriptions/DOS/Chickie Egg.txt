Chickie Egg is an unofficial remake of Chuckie Egg in true 3D graphics, created to showcase the capabilities of Criterion Studios' RenderWare engine.
The player controls a plump farmer, whose objective in each level is to collect all eggs within a set time limit while avoiding roaming emus and the duck. The level layouts generally reproduce those from Chuckie Egg, but as the game world is rendered in true 3D, it is possible to switch between three view modes: the classic mode that shows more or less the entire level; the close up view that zooms in on the player character; and what is misleadingly called the "first person" view by the electronic manual, which places the camera behind the player character.
Being a tech demo, Chickie Egg has no sound effects or music, no save game feature or a permanent scoreboard. However, the game keeps track of the highest score during each session, and allows the user to redefine control keys.
