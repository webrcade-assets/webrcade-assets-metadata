In Kret the player controls a mole who was born in the stuffy basement of a ruined palace. The owner is a sadist who dumps debris on his head. The gameplay resembles Tetris. The game starts with a board filled up with debris, and the player controls a mole located on the bottom. The aim is to remove the blocks from the board so that none of them fall on the mole's head. An additional difficulty is the inability to freely move down - the mole can only move from side to side and up. The mole is moved down from time to time by the computer.
