Tommy's High IQ is a shareware, single player, puzzle game. This game is based on Peg Solitaire in which the goal is to remove all thirty-two pegs from the board by jumping over pegs with one of the neighbouring pegs.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects, a save/load function and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
