The player must find a Dutch word of twelve letters in a 4 by 4 matrix filled with letters. The letters of the word are connected to each other either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The longer the player waits with answering, the more letters of the word are shown, but also the less points the player earns.
The game can be played with four players. The winner is the player with the most points after ten rounds.
