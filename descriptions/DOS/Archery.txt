In Archery, the player is challenged to get an arrow as near the bullseye of a moving target, which descends from the top of the screen, as possible. The player gets three tries from each of five different starting positions. More points are awarded for shots that land nearer the center, and the highest total score at the end of the game wins.
Archery may be played alone, against the computer, or against a second player.
