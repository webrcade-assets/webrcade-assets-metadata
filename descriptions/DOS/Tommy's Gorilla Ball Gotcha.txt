Tommy's Gorilla Ball Gotcha is a single player DOS game.The player takes on the role of a gorilla ball wallflower at gorilla ball dance. Being a wallflower the player naturally discourages potential dance partners by giving out 'bad vibes'. The object of the game is to get caught by other gorilla balls .The player's character gives out bad vibes, which in any other game would be classed as bullets, along eight axes; up, down, left and right and at forty-five degrees in between. Potential gorilla partners appear randomly on the screen and track towards the player who must try to make contact with them while not 'shooting' them with bad vibes. The game could be described as the opposite of a shoot-'em up. Instead of aiming a gun and trying to hit opponents, the player is trying to get close to others without hurting them while, at the same time, spraying 'bullets' all over the screen.The player starts the game with 10,000 points and loses points steadily. Every time a potential gorilla ball partner is hit by bad vibes another hundred points are lost.At the end of the game the gorilla balls do a little dance. The game ends either when the player has been caught ten times, in which case there will be a positive score, or when all points have been lost, in which case the points score will be zero and the length of time played will determine whether the player has a high enough score to get onto the high score table.The game has nine difficulty levels and the game records the top ten scores for each level.
