This add-on for the original release of SimCity adds three different alternate looks to the game: Future U.S.A., Future Europe and Moon Colony. Gameplay is unchanged by installation of the Graphics Set, but all in-game graphics and text are replaced. Buildings all look different, and the various events and disasters are reinterpreted and given a different flavor.
