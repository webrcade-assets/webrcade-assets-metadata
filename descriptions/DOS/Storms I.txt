Storms I is a text adventure game, where the plot is that a wealthy eccentric relative in Massachusetts has just passed away and you are informed that the inheritance of $7.4 million will be bequeathed to whoever first discovers a secret invention, hidden somewhere by the deceased. One of your cousins is also trying to find the hidden contraption, and you both have less than 48 hours to complete the challenge. The time limit is turn-based: each command you type in takes one minute of in-game time. You begin at your hotel, and you have 2 dollars. The first task you will need to take care of is a bout of food poisoning that you picked up on the journey here, which threatens to take you out of the race early...
