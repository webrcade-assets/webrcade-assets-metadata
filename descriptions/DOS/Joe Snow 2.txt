Another installment in the continuing adventures of our snowball hero, wherein he attempts to retain his solid phase despite the best efforts of the environment with its fireballs and lava pools.  Essentially the same as the first game with a new set of graphics and levels: make your way through the stationary game world across traps and jumping puzzles, striving for the top to reach the next level.
Once again, run-ins with fire tiles deduct from your score, and running out of points means an instant game over.  As in the previous game, higher levels mix things up with more valuable booty, and with twists such as conveyor belts and the "question block" familiar to Italian plumbers everywhere.
