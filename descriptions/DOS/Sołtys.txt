(In)famous for jokes about it, the Polish city of Wąchock is the place where the story of the Polish adventure game Sołtys takes place.
You play the head of the village of Wąchock and your aim is to find the missing husband of your daughter (who apparently isn't very attractive if you know what I mean). Scared of his future, Leon decides to run away from the wedding and you are responsible for bringing this poor guy back.
The game is a classic point and click adventure in which you collect objects and find places to use them. You move from one location to another using special "location icons". Number of available locations to visit represents the game's progress. At first there are only eight of them and later on they increase to total number of 24. The game is full of Polish jokes and "play on words" technique to give player hints how riddles should be solved.
