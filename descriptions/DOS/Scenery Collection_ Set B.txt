Beginning in 1986, SubLOGIC, developers of the original Flight Simulator Series, released "Scenery Disks" which added airports, buildings, and landscape to regions outside the basic ones.  In 1990, they re-released the disks in sets. "Set B" includes: Scenery Disk #9 (expanded Chicago area, St. Louis, Cincinnati), Scenery Disk #12 (expanded New York area, Montreal, Halifax), and Hawaiian Odyssey (which included a treasure hunt across the islands, as well as "Experimental Scenery") (see Trivia for more).This set works with all the original SubLOGIC-developed flight simulations, including Microsoft Flight Simulator versions 1-4, Sublogic Jet, and Flight Assignment: ATP.The box cover was identical for all Scenery Collection sets, except for the gold sticker on the upper left.
