The attack on Earth by the Cybrids has been repelled and humanity is starting to rebuild. But a second wave is already incoming, and the battle starts again.
The add-on to the original Earthsiege adds three new campaigns to play and several new landscapes. As for new hardware, there is a new HERC (the powerful Apocalypse) and several new Cybrid weapons as well.
