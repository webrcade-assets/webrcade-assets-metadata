Reon-ui Moheom ("Leon's Adventure") is a side-scrolling action platform game featuring an anthropomorphic lion as a protagonist. The plot revolves around a contest that will determine the new king of all animals. The protagonist sets out to compete, and will have to overcome various obstacles in his way.The game plays in a fashion rather similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. Leon can jump, run and attack enemies at close range. Continuously pressing the run button speeds him up which is important because the levels are timed. Opposing the protagonist are various other anthropomorphic animals and even plants, each type with its own distinct behaviour and attack. Sometimes the enemies drop powerups when disposed of, including extra time added to the timer. Like Sonic, Leon collects golden rings, but here these can be used to purchase powerups between levels.
