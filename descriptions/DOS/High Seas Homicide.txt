High Seas Homicide is a detective adventure shareware game with graphics, controlled with the keyboard, mainly using text commands and arrow keys, and made with the MVP Software's GameBuilder tools.You control the main character, Martin T. Berringer, a Scotland Yard detective on vacation aboard a cruise ship HMS Elias, who at the start of the game in his cabin, hears three gunshots from the ball room area. Now you have to find out who got shot & catch a killer, by looking through the environment on the ship and talking to the people on board.There is a short help text to get you started with the text commands, and actions; as is common with these games, you have to guess at most of the proper words to use. The clues you find may lead you to a suspect, and if correctly identified you get a reward - if you falsely accuse an innocent suspect, you are abandoned in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean as a punishment, so beware.
