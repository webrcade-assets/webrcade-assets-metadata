In Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! you play the Chief of Police for Midvale, Ohio. After two paintings are stolen from the local museum, you realize someone from The Great Florian's Traveling Circus and Flourishing Florilegium of Flamboyant Wonders may be responsible. You head over there with your trusty dog to hopefully uncover the truth.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! is a text adventure game with two unusual features for the genre. First, it has background music. Second, certain elements can be viewed, which will display an actual image of the object. Both features were added to show off the capabilities of the Master's Edition of the Adventure Game Toolkit.
