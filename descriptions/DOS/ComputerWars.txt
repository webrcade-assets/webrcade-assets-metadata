ComputerWars is an Artillery clone. The game is played by one player vs the computer or by two players. One player takes the part of an IBM PC and the other takes the role of a MAC. They each take turns firing floppy discs at each other in a cityscape setting. The winner is the person/machine that eliminates the other. There is no save game function, no high score function, and the game is entirely keyboard controlled.
