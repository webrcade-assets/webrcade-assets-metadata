Tommy's Lander is a single player, shareware variant of Lunar Lander that uses character graphics.
As with the original game the objective is to land a spaceship successfully balancing the need for a controlled descent and safe landing zone with limited fuel. This game adds other variations to that original concept, such as a parachute, glider wings added to which different attempts will have different gravity, air pressure, weather and fuel constraints.
One documented, but unobserved feature, is the presence of buildings on the surface which indicates then presence of hostile enemies.
The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
