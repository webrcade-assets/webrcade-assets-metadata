Spider Web is a single player, shareware game. It is controlled by keyboard, mouse, or joystick and has basic music sound effects, both of which consist of bleeps and whistles.
The object is to spin a web and catch all of the flies before they breed out of control. Flies can be eliminated by erasing them with the spider when suspended with a web strand or hitting them with the bar or mouse button.
