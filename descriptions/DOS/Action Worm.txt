Action Worm is a single-player Light cycle variant. In this game, the player controls the end of a continuously growing line. The objective is to extend the line as much as possible without colliding with previously visited spaces or the red blocks that begin to appear on the field. Hitting a red block results in the loss of one of the playerâ€™s five lives. After losing a life, the the line continues to grow without pause. Collecting green blocks grants a bonus life. Additionally, when the line hits a wall, it automatically changes direction and continues.
