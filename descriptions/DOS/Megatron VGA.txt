In Megatron VGA the player sits in the cockpit of a large walking tank, similar to those from FASA's BattleTech universe.
The player can walk around in a first person perspective through maze-like environments similar in technical presentation to Eye of the Beholder (the player can only walk in fixed steps of a single 3D tile). Controlling multiple different weapons the player must destroy enemy mechs before they try the same. Separate shields on the front and back of the mech must protect players from getting destroyed instantly.
The player can choose between different mechs and multiple difficulty levels. A map of the level is shown at the bottom of the screen at all times, but the player can only detect the enemy when he's in radar range.
