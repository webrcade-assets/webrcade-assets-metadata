PC Foreplay is a very simple, single player, mouse controlled, adult, game with no sound.In this game the player has to stroke Sharon, a lightly dressed model, with their mouse pointer. If done correctly then her mood, indicated by a rising thermometer, improves and she removes bits of what little clothing she is wearing. If done incorrectly her mood changes and the player must start again from the beginning.The game uses the keyboard to scroll down through the text box and the mouse to interact with Sharon.
