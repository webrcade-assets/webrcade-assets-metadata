Phase2 is a 3D first-person shooter game similar to Zarch. The player controls a spaceship and flies through different environments shooting enemies. Each level consists of a closed environment and the ship can be moved in any direction. A mini-map in the top left corner shows the position of enemies. The ship also needs to watch out for mountains and other parts in the environment. Destroying enemies is rewarded with a currency that can be used at an equipment shop to purchase new items such as nitrogas, photon torpedos or exploding bullets. The shareware version is limited to 10 levels on 2 planets, while the registered version contains 30 levels with 4 planets in total, as well as a graphic level editor.
