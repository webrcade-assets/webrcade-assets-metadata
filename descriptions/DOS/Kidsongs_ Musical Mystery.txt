Kidsongs: Musical Mystery is a game for children aged three to seven based on the US PBS TV show where youngsters produce their own music based, kid's television show. This game stars the fantasy characters Billy and Ruby Biggle in a simple adventure game. Professor Majorchord wants to give a concert with his orchestra, but the musicians cannot find their instruments. There are eight musicians that need an instrument and once it has been found it needs to be returned to its owner. From a central location it is possible to track what has been solved and what is left to do. The game can be played with either Billy or Ruby and there are two difficulty levels.There are a few educational elements through mini-games that involve matching sound with pictures or finding out which pictures do not match the others. It introduces basic musical genres and recognizing instruments. The game consists of a number of fixed-screen locations such as a mall, a street, a fair, a park, a castle, the ocean floor or a habor where different parts of the environment can be clicked for a short animation or interactive sequence. There are small puzzles to be solved. That is the main way to locate the missing instruments as there is always a character around that explains what instrument is missing. There are also a large number of songs to listen to.
