Barney Hunter is a shooting range game where the player shoots at Barneys (from the American children's television series Barney & friends). Why? Because Barney is Satan and he has possessed your son. There are four weapons to choose among: pistol, sub-machine gun, shotgun and a futuristic energy rifle. Once a weapon has been chosen the player has to hit as many Barneys as possible before the time runs out. Game time can be set to 60 seconds or 3 minutes.
