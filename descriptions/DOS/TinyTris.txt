TinyTris approximates the Game Boy version of Tetris as a PC game in less than 3 KB. It only implements the classic game mode, known as "A-type" in the Game Boy version: move, rotate and drop the falling 4-piece blocks, stack them in a pile at the bottom of the pit, and form complete horizontal lines to eliminate them for points. The action speeds up on each new level, but instead of leveling up every ten lines, the proverbial kick up the arse arrives at increasing intervals - you advance a level when your line count is a power of two, which means that the difficulty ramp is more gradual.
