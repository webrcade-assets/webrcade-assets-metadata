Smooth Tetris is a clone with somewhat slower falling blocks than the original Tetris. The blocks fall into the bottom of a box, and are removed when a layer is filled. Each type of block removed adds to a rising bar-chart on the right of the main area. The blocks can be rotated, moved left & right, and dropped in place using the keyboard.
The keys used can be reconfigured if needed. There is also a high-score list for your name when you end a game.
