Odysseus Kent, an odd little fellow is searching for the Lost Treasure of Randolph McBoing (all based on a map he got from a shadowy guy at the bus stop). Equipped with a trusty shovel and treasure map, the would-be treasure hunter braves the cold and darkness to the supposed site where the treasure lies...at the cemetery in the courtyard of the local church. Suddenly out of the darkness, a mysterious figure appears with a cursing eye! Just his luck, he's caught red-handed by the local priest...Oh, well. Now, he has to find access the hard way, since the priest isn't hiring any novice grave diggers.
Another freeware game by Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw is a small but humorous adventure game similar to the likes of Monkey Island (you'll notice the resemblance when our hero talks).
The game, like most 3rd Person adventure games, consists of action buttons which you use to interact with your surrounding. Simple as it is, it has your standard Look, Use, Talk, Inventory features.
