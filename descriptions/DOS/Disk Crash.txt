The object of Disk Crash is to guide the unlikely protagonist, a floppy disk (of the actually-floppy variety!), from the bottom of the screen to the top by traversing a series of floors. The flexible storage device can cross one floor at a time; when it arrives at the opposite end, it climbs up to the next one and must travel across in the opposite direction. Trouble is, the playfield is plagued by a gang of horseshoe magnets that bounce up and down at varying speeds. Each passage must be carefully timed and executed, as any collision with a magnet spells terminal data corruption for our plastic jacket clad hero.
