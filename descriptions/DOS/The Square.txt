The Square is a puzzle game that is similar to a 2D version of the Rubik's Cube puzzle. A square matrix of colored cells is scrambled and the player must unscramble it by sliding the rows and columns of the matrix until all of the like-colored cells are grouped together. The game offers two modes of play, "HARD", where individual rows and columns may be moved, and "HARDER", where only adjacent pairs of rows and columns can be moved.
