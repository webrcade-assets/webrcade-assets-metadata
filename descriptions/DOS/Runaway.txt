Runaway is set in a distant future where illegal organizations have seized large parts of the galaxy. The galaxyâ€™s government dispatched spies, but unfortunately, they were captured and sent to a high-security prison on Ari, Greece. Now, the player assumes control of one of these spy units and must escape the solar system.
The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter featuring 13 levels and 5 bosses. To survive, the player must shoot down enemies and avoid their projectiles, as each contact reduces the life bar. When the life bar is empty, one of live is lost, and the game ends when all lives are gone. Throughout the levels, power-ups appear, granting ship upgrades (such as a protective satellite, improved weapons, or additional speed) or money. Players can use money to purchase upgrades or extra lives between levels.
