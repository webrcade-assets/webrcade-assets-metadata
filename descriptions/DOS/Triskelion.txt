Triskelion is a single player freeware puzzle game.Triskelion is a genetic word for any device or motif which has three symbols that share a common centre. This can be curved arms, or legs in the case of the symbol common to the Isle of Man (UK). In this case it is three overlapping circles. Each circle is comprised of squares, called marbles in the documentation. Each marble has its own colour (blue, green and red). A fourth colour (yellow) is used for the centre of the design where all three circles overlap. The object of the puzzle is to find a way to rotate all the yellow segments out of the central area and replace them with another single colour.The game is entirely controlled by the keyboard and has no sound and no save/load feature.
