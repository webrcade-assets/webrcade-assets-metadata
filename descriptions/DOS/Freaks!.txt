You are the Magician, Mother Earth's preferred son. For a long time you have researched and created monsters of the most horrible nature. Your assistant, the Learner, when given a little bit of power, eventually turned against you, ripping apart your body and banishing you to absolute darkness. Now Mother Earth has recreated your body, but your creations no longer recognize you. Worse still, you aren't quite back to how you were, so you'll need to find the parts of your former body.Freaks! is an unusual FPS in the style of Wolfenstein 3D. Your view is limited to 90-degree angles, though you can move freely within the game world. Your gun has infinite ammo and you don't find any health pick-ups, you regain health by killing enemies. The only pick-ups in the game world are the various plot items, in the first episode you are tasked with finding your body parts. Not only is this the primary objective, but it opens some doors in-game.There are four episodes, the first and third in vaguely hellish locations, the second in a space station, and the final one a boss fight against the Learner.
