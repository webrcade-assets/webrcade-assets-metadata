In this advergame for the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" the player is responsible for guiding the information beam of a news satellite to the Spiegel editorial staff. The problem is that space isn't empty as there are planets between the satellite and its destination. To reach the goal parabolic reflectors have to be arranged to lead the beam. As the game progresses new elements like signal enhancers and diverters are introduced. Each level has a time limit. Games can be saved and a highscore list is included.
