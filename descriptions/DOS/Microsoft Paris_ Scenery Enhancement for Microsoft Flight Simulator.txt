This official scenery add-on for the Microsoft Flight Simulator (version 5.0 is required at least) brings to you the French capitol Paris. Take an up-close look at the Eiffel Tower and get an aerial view of the Arc de Triomphe. Fly over the Louvre, get a bird's eye view of Notre Dame, feel the breeze of the Seine. Take off from Roissy Charles de Gaulle or Orly Airport.
