Sacrilege! is a puzzle game in which the player is tasked with removing all the tiles present on screen by clicking on them. The challenge comes from the fact you can only click tiles that are separated by one tile from the one you just clicked.The red tile shows the last selected tile. Green tiles are mystery tilesâ€”if clicked on they generate either a bonus (250 extra points or 20 additional seconds on the clock) or a penalty (250 points deducted or being sent back to the previous level). Green tiles can also be ignored altogether.The player loses a life if he or she does not complete a level within the time limit. The game contains 75 levels in total.
