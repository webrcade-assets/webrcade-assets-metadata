MegaTris is a Tetris variant. The game offers two game modes (7 or 23 types of bricks), five difficulty levels (50-250 bricks), ten types of additional tricks and extra obstacles. The additional tricks, such as: pistol, bomb, rocket, water or rammer are earned for the successive removal of bricks levels from the board. Each new brick on the board brings the player closer to a level of one hundred percent. The value of the block depends on the level of difficulty (0,4 up to 2 percent per brick).
