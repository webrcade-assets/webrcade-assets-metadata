Best of ZZT is a kind of sequel to ZZT and Super ZZT. It is a shareware game that showcases what ZZT can do.
EpicÂ MegaGames created ZZT with its game worlds and released it together with its level editor and world creation tools. This proved hugely popular and led to many home made worlds being created and shared on-line via bulletin boards. In 1991 Epic held a Game Design Contest to find the best of these game boards and they received over one thousand entries. Game boards from this contest were used to create two new game worlds, 'The Secret of Headhunter Isle' and 'Royal Treasures' which Epic released as shareware in 1992 under the name Best of ZZT.
