For maze maniacs who are bored of rectangular layouts and right angles, PolyMaze generates mazes in a multitude of different shapes, from a triangle to a 61-vertex polygon. Mazes are solved by traversing them along a grid, from a point on the perimeter towards the center, and each maze can contain 2 to 18 levels along the way; a later version of the game allows players to save their progress and retrieve it later, in case they get lost. Those who don't feel like doing their own path-finding may hand the task over to the computer, or just watch random mazes being generated.
