In StixWorld you control a stick-figure character created by a little girl in her notebook. It turns out she had gotten into a fight with her brother after he made all sorts of scribbles and monsters in her notebook (your world). The kids' parents had sent them both to their rooms and thrown the notebook into the recycle bin. Your mission is to save the notebook from the recycling truck. Your only hope is to find the guru you heard about who can teach you how to escape the notebook into the real world. Unfortunately, you must deal with all of the brother's scribbles and monsters along the way.
StixWorld is a 2D side-scrolling platform game using a 2D geometry engine rather than sprites. The artwork is in the style of a child's stick-figure drawings in a notebook, down to the notebook-paper style background. The story, art-style, and underlying 2D geometry engine allow all the objects to be animated, rotated, and scaled.
For example, in one level you ride a hot-air balloon to the moon and are able to walk all the way around the moon, ending up upside-down at the bottom, where a sign says "Earth" with an arrow pointing down -- you jump and rotate while falling until you land back on the Earth. In another level you jump from car to car along a train, trying to get to the engine, and you see mountains in the distance. Once you reach the engine you find that you can jump from the smoke clouds to the tops of the mountains, and the world scales as you jump -- it was just a small toy train after all.
