The objective of Kruiswoord (Crossword) is to fill in the entire crossword with Dutch words. The player can ask the computer to check whether the filled in words are right or not. For every letter that is not filled in, the player gets one hit point. For every letter that is filled in wrong, the player gets three hit points. When the player does not know a word, she can ask the computer to fill in the right word. This costs 25 hit points. When the whole puzzle is filled in right, the game ends. The player should get the least amount of hit points as possible.
