Around the World in 80 Days is a children's game based on the novel of the same name. It follows the English nobleman Phineas Fogg and his sidekick Sidney (a monkey) who bets that he is able to travel around the world in 80 days.During his travels (the next destination can be picked from a world map), Phineas is presented with several situations and problems, some created by his adversary Baron Hogsbreath, which he can't solve without the player's help. The player can interact with the scene with four painting tools, e.g. the pencil Nick is used to draw things which then become real or the rubber Winston is used to remove things from the scene. For example, when a museum's curator refuses to let Sidney into the museum, the player can remove the word "no" from a sign which says "no monkeys allowed". The things the player can do in each scene are limited, e.g. Nick only has two or three things available to draw, and there is no way to fail. The dialogue and animations are humorous.The educational aspect of the game is about improving the player's reading skill and broaden the vocabulary. For this reason, the player can click on some "hot words" (e.g. foreign expressions) to get an explanation of their meaning.
