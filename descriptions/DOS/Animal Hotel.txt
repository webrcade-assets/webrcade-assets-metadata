Animal Hotel is a children's memory game for multiple systems.
The player is given either three or six hotel rooms based on the difficulty level. The player can then select to have one to five seconds to see which animal is inhabiting each room. A room is then randomly chosen, and the player must select from a list of animals which one was staying in that room.
