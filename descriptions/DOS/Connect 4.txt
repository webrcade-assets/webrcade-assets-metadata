Connect 4 is an implementation of the board game Connect Four, in which players take turns at dropping tokens into a grid, with the goal of creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four tokens of their color. The grid is seven columns wide by six rows deep. After choosing the next row to drop a token into, it always drops to the bottom row that is not yet occupied.The game is played by one player against a computer opponent, the difficulty of which can be scaled by limiting how much real-world time it is allowed to spend on calculating its moves. Playing on a faster CPU increases the opponent's strength, as does increasing its time allowance. Statistics about the computation time spent are displayed in a sidebar, and finished rounds can be printed out. It's also possible to customize the colors of the game display.
