The first playable version of the GemStone series, as GemStone I was a prototype only, GemStone ][ is an early text-based online multiplayer game, in the genre of medieval fantasy, in a world called Elanthia. There were four possible professions: Warriors, mages, clerics, and thieves.
GemStone ][ was the most popular game on the early GEnie online service, running from April 1988 until January 1, 1990, when it was entirely replaced by GemStone III.
