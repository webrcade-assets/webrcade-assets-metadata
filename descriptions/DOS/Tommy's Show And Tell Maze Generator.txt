Tommy's Show and Tell Maze Generator is a shareware program that generates mazes, it's part game generator and part 'fun software'. The player inputs a series of parameters that control the size of the maze, the colours, the width of the pathways etc and the program does the rest. Mazes can be printed and used as puzzles, other this it has another use, the documentation states that:-"This is a great program for leaving on all day when your pc isn't doing anything important, in order to impress visitors. (you can make up a story about what it is doing)" As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects, a demo mode, and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
