SpinWall is a single player, shareware maze game.
The player controls a ghost who wanders through the maze collecting gems. Being a ghost means that the player walks through coloured walls if they have collected a key of the appropriate colour. Obstacles in the form of paint cans exist within the maze. If the player mistakenly bumps into one of these the whole of the accessible part of the maze is flooded with that colour, making it impossible to see the location of the gems.
The object is to arrive in the Winners Circle with a high score; each gem collected increases the score, each move made reduces it, making route planning very important. The path through the maze is not a simple one and it may prove impossible to access some areas; this is where the spin in SpinWall comes into play. Pressing the S key causes the corners of the walls to spin generating new openings and closing off others.
