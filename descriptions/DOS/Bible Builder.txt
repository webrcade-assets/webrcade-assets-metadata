Bible Builder is a single-player educational quiz game which aims to promote an increased knowledge of the bible. It is a form of quiz with six difficulty settings.
In this game the game area takes the form of a book and the player's task is to reveal a 'Secret Bible Verse' by clicking on bookmarked pages and answering questions. Each question reveals a jigsaw piece on which there is a piece of the text, After gaining a new piece of text the player is asked to enter the book, chapter and verse where it can be found in the bible. Each game is timed, the time remaining is shown as a candle burning down. Answering a question, correctly or incorrectly, costs one hour while making an incorrect guess at the location of the secret verse also costs time.
The game has optional music in the form of hymns played on a synthesized old fashioned church organ and at least one of the questions is based on identifying a hymn while almost all the other questions are based on bible stories. Throughout the game there's a helpful angel on-screen to provide additional information.
