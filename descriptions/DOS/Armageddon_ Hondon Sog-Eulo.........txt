In Amagedon: Hondon Sog-Eulo........, players embark on a mission to reclaim Earth from attackers. It is based on the animated movie Armageddon, but features no in-game story except an introductory and concluding movie, along with brief mission briefings. During missions, players control a spaceship in a first-person view. The 11 missions typically involve eliminating specific enemies, occasionally under a time limit or while protecting another ship. There is no free movement through space; players use a crosshair to aim their equipped weapon and   rotate the ship 360 degrees. Enemy positions are displayed on a radar. Between missions, players can utilize acquired funds to purchase new ships, weapons, and ammunition, as well as enhance their energy, defense, and offensive capabilities. Saving progress between missions is possible, but frequent reloading boost enemy stats and may lead to an assault.
