The second mission disk for the original Comanche adds 4 more campaigns with 10 missions each. There are also new terrain types and new enemies: the 500MD Defender Helicopter, the OSA-II missile boat and the Lebed air-cushioned landing craft.
The graphics engine has been refined and now supports reflective water and weather effects like snow and haze.
Also new are several options to make the controls more realistic and less arcade-like.
