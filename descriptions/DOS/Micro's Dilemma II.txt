The player guides Micro to push reflectors, activate a switch to turn green circles pink, then activate the laser to shoot every pink circle. Each level that follows will be more challenging than the first and sometimes introduce a new element. The laser does have limited power and if Micro stands in the way can get fried by it. The game has three difficulty levels and the option to skip some game levels.
