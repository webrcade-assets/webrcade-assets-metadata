Made by the same team that produced TFX, this simulation focuses on the Eurofighter 2000.Set in a fictional campaign against Russia, you are called into action when a Russian force attempts to take control of Norway and Sweden as a foothold to an invasion of northern Europe. You'll play through a variety of randomly-generated missions ranging from patrols to ground strikes. Included as well is a fairly extensive multi-player support, including network and modem play.
