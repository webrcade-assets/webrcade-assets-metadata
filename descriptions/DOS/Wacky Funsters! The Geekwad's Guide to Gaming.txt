Includes parodies of arcade games Pong (Ping), Asteroids (Steroids), Hard Driving (Roadkill!, in which the player runs over giant lunch meats that inexplicably appear in front of the player's car), Street Fighter (Big Guys with Muscles, a fighting game including such opponents as a third-grade teacher).
