Emeritus Pong is a clone of the Pong game. It allows to compete with another player or against the computer. It features a single game mode as well, where the player may practice bouncing from the wall. There is a demo clock mode included, showing the current time. The gameplay itself remains unchanged. Players control a paddle represented by a white line. One paddle is on the right side of the screen, the other on the left. The current score is shown at the top.
