3Detris is a falling block puzzle which uses a slightly elevated view and is meant to be played with 3D glasses. It uses the usual game mechanics: blocks using the common Tetris shapes fall from above and the player has to turn and position them to create full lines. Full lines disappear and free space for more blocks. The game ends when a block can't fall down because the way is blocked.The viewpoint of the playing field fits into a fixed perspective but, nevertheless, the player can move the camera 360 degrees. After the game is lost, the viewing point is changed and the camera can be moved freely.
