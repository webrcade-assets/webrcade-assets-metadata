Hunchback 2 (also known as Rampart Revenge: Rampart Rampage 2) is a sequel to Hunchback 96, which is turn is a loose remake of Ocean Software's game Hunchback. As such, Hunchback 2 may be thought of as a remake/successor to the official sequel, Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge.The game mechanics and visuals are the same as in the original Hunchback 96. The player controls an unarmed character (depicted as a hunchback in the original releases, and subsequently replaced with a masked protagonist in blue clothes and a feather hat, the same as in the Rampart Rampage version) who must traverse levels from left to right, dodging projectiles and overcoming other obstacles such as fire pits. Each hit by a projectile removes one life and restarts the level. All these elements mirror the gameplay of Ocean Software's Hunchback, but the levels are generally more intricate and detailed, with each level taking up more than one screen. This allows to crank up difficulty as the player is at first unaware of the obstacles lying ahead, and is sometimes forced to make leaps of faith into the unknown, possibly risking collision with hazards if the timing is wrong.The official game page gives the player character's name as Igor and mentions that his goal is to rescue Lucretia (likely a love interest). However the game itself never explains the background story and just plunges the player into action.
