747-400 Precision Simulator is a civil flight simulator concentrating on the Boeing 747-400 (744) line. The game is foremost designed as a training tool and therefore the actual view outside the aircraft is small; the vast majority of the screen is used by cockpit instruments. Those are functional and can be operated by the player, even when the auto-pilot is on. However, not only the controls are simulated but also the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic side of the aircraft.
The player may fly around the world, land on about 1500 runways or recreate some actual flight routes. Also featured are an aerodynamics simulation, malfunction scenarios and weather.
