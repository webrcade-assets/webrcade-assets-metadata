Match Day Manager is a football (soccer) managing game featuring teams from England, where players start by managing any team of Division 3 (fourth tier), and attempt to climb to the Premiership.
The player has the usual array of options, from assigning training, scouting, checking who are the favourites of the crowd (after all, they want to to see them play), sign players and staff (scout, trainer and physio), but the main difference between MDM and other managing games is how time passes: instead of making all changes and then clicking a button to jump to the next matchday, the manager has a calendar with five daily time slots, and to make any changes, they have to be booked first. The only actions that don't need any booking are consulting their own fixtures, tables and the financial status.
It's also possible to edit the name pool, as well as editing each teams kits and names.
