Barbarian is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls a hominid who is suddenly unfrozen and must navigate through six levels. Most levels follow traditional platformer mechanics: the protagonist can move and jump, avoid harmful obstacles, and jump between platforms. Enemies can be defeated by either jumping on them, causing the protagonist to bounce off, or by using a limited supply of throwing weapons. Additional ammo and different weapons can be collected throughout the game. Both enemies and the protagonist can withstand multiple hits before dying, except for spikes and bottomless pits, which result in instant death.
The game features six stages, each divided into two or three levels, except for the swimming stage, which consists of only one level. Occasionally, a boss fight concludes a level. After completing a level, players are rewarded with a rendered cutscene depicting the protagonist in various scenarios, such as singing on a stage. These cutscenes are unrelated to the main gameplay.
