ARO und ELMI im Kampf gegen die Bakterien Bande (German for "Aro and Elmi in the Fight against the Bacteria Gang") is a promotional and educational game produced for the German toothpaste manufacturer Wybert. It is a side-scrolling platform game with shooting elements and occasional quizzes that are aimed at teaching young players the basics of mouth hygiene.
Aro and Elmi are two anthropomorphic toothpaste tubes, named after Wybert's flagship products, Aronal and Elmex, which are advertised as professional care agents for gums and teeth, respectively. As such, the player controls Aro in "Gum World" levels, and switches to Elmi in "Tooth World" levels. The main objective is the same: clear each level from food debris and harmful bacteria. The former are simply collected as static items for points, while the latter are active enemies that must be dispatched by shooting toothpaste particles, which fly an arc-like trajectory. Other items in the game include a tooth (extra life), elmex gel tubes that give the ability to instantly clear a screen from all enemies, and Aronal/Elmex tubes that contain additional ammo.
