This is the sequel to Kingdom: The Far Reaches. Many years ago, the wise Mobus broke a powerful amulet called "The Hand" in 5 pieces in order to protect it from getting into the hands of his evil brother Torlock. These pieces were sent to the far corners of the land. As the young Prince Lathan Kandor you have already retrieved the Black Mace, the Hunting Horn and the Orb of Mobus (in the previous game). Now you must retrieve the final 2 pieces (the Dagger of Arne and the Crown of Malric), defeat evil and be reunited with Princess Grace Delight.This is an adventure from the makers of Dragon's Lair. The plot isn't exactly original or complex, but the animation is fluid and well-drawn. Gameplay is about using the right item or making the correct choice between the animated sequences; some of these choices are timed, meaning that you can lose health or even die, but there are plenty of opportunities to replenish your health. Of special note is the ever-present Disney-like music.
