fRaBs (which stands for "Free Abuse") is a free and open source game based on the code of Crack dot Com's Abuse. As the original source code release also included all shareware data from Abuse, fRaBs is essentially an enhanced free version of the base game with community-made levels.
The single-player campaign in fRaBs starts in a hub level, allowing access to a total of six different episodes, including all shareware levels from the original Abuse as per the source code license. Several community-made mods are also included. The game has 20 network multiplayer levels.
Additionally, fRaBs comes with a built-in level editor and an art file editor for further moddabilty.
