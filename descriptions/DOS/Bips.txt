This is a block-pushing puzzle game, where the objective is to collect all diamonds in each level. Most levels also have bombs; if you push a box into a bomb it will explode, destroying both the box and the bomb. Running directly into a bomb without a box is not recommended.Bips (Bryant's Incredible Puzzles) has three sets of levels, easy, medium, and hard, with "a special surprise" if you beat all three level sets.
