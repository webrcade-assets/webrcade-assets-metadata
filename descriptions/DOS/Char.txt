In Char the player takes control over 22 year old Mack, who on a Thursday night decided to dust off his old NES and play some old games. The NES doesn't work, Mack goes berserk and kicks it repeatedly until it explodes. When Mack comes back to his senses he discovers that he is trapped inside the NES-unit. The player starts with 9 lives and a machine gun and must now get Mack back into the real world. The backdrop for each level comes from various NES-games (such as Castlevania and Super Mario Bros). Not all enemies are hurt by the players weapon but the ones who are will turn into a rain of coins when they die, collect 200 of these coins to gain an extra life. This game was written in C++ using Allegro.
