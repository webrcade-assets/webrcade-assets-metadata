Select from five character classes (Paladin, Necromancer, Barbarian, Zen-Druid, Shadowy Tracker) and explore the three levels of the dungeon Ebon Titan. If you make it to the end you face off against the boss Titan himself. The game mixes elements from classic text based adventure gaming like inventory based puzzle solving with more action oriented dungeon crawl style hack and slash game play. The game also employs a simple top-down ASCII based graphical map of your surroundings in addition to the usual textual description and utilizes the PC speaker for battle sounds and the like.
