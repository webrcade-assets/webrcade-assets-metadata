Street Rod: Data Disk is an expansion disk for the car building and racing game Street Rod. The Data Disk allows the game to be played using a different set of classic cars. When substituted for the second Street Rod floppy disk, the expansion completely replaces the original set of cars with a new collection. Because the Data Disk merely replaces the data for the game's original cars, you cannot race the Street Rod cars against the Data Disk cars.
The data disk gives you 25 new cars to buy, sell, modify and race. These include: 1955 Chevrolet Nomad wagon, 1959 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, 1934 Ford Woodie, 1939 Pontiac two-door coupe and 1948 Chrysler Town & Country convertible.
