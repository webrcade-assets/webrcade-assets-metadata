Black Crown is a hybrid of genres with strategy and RPG including action elements. It is played on a board closely resembling that of ludo (or, more exactly, the Spanish variant called 'parch√≠s', due to the Spanish origin of the game itself).It can be played by up to four players, each of whom chooses a city (faction). The factions resemble barbarians, knights, sorcerers and valkyries. Each faction has three characters (shown as tokens on the game board at the bottom-right part of the screen).The upper part of the screen has a scrolling view that shows how the character is moving through the world as the token advances on the board. Unlike in ludo, when a character lands on a square occupied by another's player character, it does not capture it, but instead an arcade fight starts. The characters can also find different NPCs throughout the board, allowing for different interactions, as well as gather objects that can be used in particular situations.
