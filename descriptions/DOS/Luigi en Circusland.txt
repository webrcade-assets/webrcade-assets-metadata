Luigi en Circusland is the sequel to Luigi & Spaghetti, but this second unofficial outing of Mario's brother is basically a level modification of its predecessor, with little changes respecting the gameplay, sound or graphic appearance. The only notorious one would be that this time you won't count with Spaghetti's help.Now you will guide Luigi as he explores different parts of a circus while beating some of the evil clowns and other funny enemies who would want to eliminate him, so in order to avoid it, he will be able to use two kind of punches (impact or smash), the classic "jump on them" and sometimes the possibility of escaping.It was also the last Topo 's attempt to maintain itself on the market before completely disappearing from the gaming scene.
