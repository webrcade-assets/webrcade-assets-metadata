Freak Farm is a simple RPG where the player assumes the role of a tomato trying to escape from a farm filled with mutated vegetables and animals. Gameplay is very simple and consists of farming random encounters to level up, until you are strong enough to progress to the next area where tougher enemies await. Combat is similar to Wizardry, except with only one player character. You can attack, attempt to flee, or cast a spell. The attack becomes more powerful with each levelup, and new spells are likewise unlocked by leveling.
The game was made by a man nicknamed "Tomato-San" who lives in Arizona (where the game's farm is located) and was active in the Japanese-to-English game translation scene, having translated games like Bahamut Lagoon, Star Ocean, and Live a Live before he created this game.
