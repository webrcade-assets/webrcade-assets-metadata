Ms Pac PC is an unofficial DOS conversion of Ms. Pac-Man. It follows the basic Pac-Man formula: the player moves around in maze with the goal to eat all drops which are lying in the hallways, However, there are also ghosts of different colour walking around the maze, and their touch is deadly. The player can also collect special items which either give bonus points or allow Ms. Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited amount of time.
