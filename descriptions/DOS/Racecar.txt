If you've ever felt like challenging your IBM to a race, look no further than Race Car to get your speed thrills in 40-column ASCII graphics. The action takes place on a figure-8 race track, where one player competes for a single lap against the computer, represented by a smiling face (the computer holds the title of champion, which explains the mirth).Your car steers and turns automatically -- the only controls are speeding up and braking. Turning corners at unsafe speeds may result in a crash, which can set you back valuable time. The first to cross the finish line wins the race; 3 difficulty levels are available, plus a demonstration mode for those who prefer the role of spectators.
