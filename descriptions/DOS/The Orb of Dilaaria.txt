The Orb of Dilaaria is a fantasy-themed first-person shooter that runs on a heavily modified Wolfenstein 3D engine. The story takes place in the land of the Seven Kingdoms that has received the Orb as a heavenly gift for protection, but the artifact is stolen by the dark forces of a fallen angel-like being called Wersin the Deceiver. The main character, the royal guard of the Orb, is captured and thrown into a dungeon, barely alive, but manages to overpower a guard and acquire a mace, from which point the game starts.Gameplay-wise, it is generally very similar to Wolfenstein 3D, with fantasy weapons replacing the guns, much like how Heretic takes after Doom in a fantasy setting. However, The Orb of Dilaaria also introduces many advanced features not found in Wolfenstein 3D, with the most notable one being non-linear level progression: many levels have more than one normal exit that leads to a different next level, so while the entire campaign spans across 30 levels, there are actually over 60 unique levels in this game. There are also floor and ceiling textures, damaging floors, open areas with skyboxes, unique item powerups not found in other Wolfenstein 3D engine games, and a bestiary that catalogues the monsters that the player encounters along the journey.The Orb of Dilaaria was released as freeware. Much of its art was edited from sprites and textures taken from popular fantasy first-person games of the 1990s like Heretic, HeXen and Witchaven. Apart from this fact, it is a complete, stand-alone game.
