The Wild World of Madison Jaxx is an edutainment game that teaches geography. It comes on 5 CDs and features a large amount of full motion video (FMV). The title character Madison Jaxx is the head of GSS - a quasi-secret organization that solves crimes all over the world. You take the role of one of the special agents working for GSS, each of whom have different backgrounds and special skills, travel to somewhere on Earth, and attempt to solve a specific crime and catch a specific criminal.
Gameplay consists largely of reading text and listening to voiceovers about the locations visited, and then answering geography-based trivia questions. On occasion, you will be called upon to click quickly on something before something bad happens to you, or to answer a more detective-oriented question, but there is a lot of text, a lot of talking, and the actual gameplay is a bit sparse.
The game is similar to the Carmen Sandiego games in several ways, but the tone is much more serious and the gameplay differs in many respects.
