Cobra Gunship is a 2D side-scrolling shooter in the tradition of games like Choplifter or Armor Alley. You can only fly a Cobra attack helicopter and shoot with your machine gun, rockets and bombs on enemy tanks or trucks. They leave coins behind and so you are attempt to fly into the enemy fire to get the money. You can buy new weapons or restock your ammo with the earnings from the mission. Other helicopters are not available as playable units, but the enemies use other types of choppers and jets.
The missions vary with tasks such as search & destroy, rescue-the-saboteur, or protect a convoy or base. There are unrealistic elements such as levels where you have to avoid flying mines that are arranged like a labyrinth. You can choose your mission on a tree and get a little info about it before accepting it. So you can avoid some missions without getting stuck on harder ones.
The graphics have a pre-rendered, contemporary style . The game was sold as shareware. You had to send $21 to Elysium Digital and get an unlock code for 30 missions.
