The Covert Operations is the official expansion for Command & Conquer. It adds 15 new singleplayer missions to the game: 7 for GDI and 8 for Nod. The missions can be played in any order and are noticeably more difficult than any in the original game. In addition, there are also 10 new multiplayer maps.
Several units that had only been available in multiplayer mode in the original game now regularly appear in the new single-player missions as well, including Nod's chem troopers and SSM launchers.
The add-on disc can be used with both the original release of Command & Conquer as well as the Special Gold Edition re-release for Windows.
