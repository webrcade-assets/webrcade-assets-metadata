The Kirsta Patience card games are:

The Solitaire game is based on the board game, with pegs placed in a cross pattern, where you are to jump over a peg to remove it, the goal is to end up with a single peg in the middle.
The text adventure game, called 'Kirsta Computer Adventure 1', is made in the standard interactive fiction style, where you are dropped in a magic fantasy land, and interact with the environment using text commands to e.g. move in compass directions, pick up and use objects, trade with creatures you encounter, solve riddles and explore caves, to find the missing regal treasures with which you can become ruler of the 'Kingdom of Kirsta', and restore it to its former glory.
In addition to the full games, the bundle also contains demos for three of the developers other games: Backgammon, Cribbage and Draughts.
