1 Ton is a freeware game where the player controls a weight of one ton. The ton can be moved around freely with the mouse, although it also falls due to gravity. Pressing the plunger on the right side of the screen summons a man onto the playfield, who then proceeds to walk around the screen. The goal of the game is simple: crushing as many of the people as possible. This is accomplished by hitting the people with the ton. There is no text or any kind of score displayed in the game. Pressing any key on the keyboard ends the game.
