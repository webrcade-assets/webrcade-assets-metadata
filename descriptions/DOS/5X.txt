5X is an Ataxx variant. It is a turn-based strategy game with grid-based playfields. The idea is that both opponents occupy a number of grids and can move one of these grids in each round. Moving one grid results in cloning it (which means the player occupies one more than before) while moving two grids results in the original grid becoming neutral. When moving besides a grid occupied by the other player, that grid and all adjacent hostile ones switch to the player's possession. The winner is either the player who has the most fields under control when there are no neutral pieces left or who forces the opponent into a position without a valid move.This game features two scenarios (Sasha and Alien Invasion) which only differ in the UI art, the enemy icon and the background image which is revealed when the player possesses grids. Alien Invasion is science-fiction based while Sasha features digitized images of a woman. Both of these scenarios have five levels (best of seven matches) with varying background images and grid layouts which are played against the AI.There is also an adult version with nudity available.
