5-Letter-Kruiswoord (5-letter-crossword in English) is a game in which the player solves a crossword that consists of only 5 letter words. The player can at any time check whether the answers he/she has given are correct. For every letter that is not filled in, the player gets 1 point. For every letter that is filled in wrong, the player gets 3 points. When the player does not know an answer, they can ask the computer for the right answer, but 25 points are given. The objective of the game is to fill in the whole crossword with the right answers and get as few points as possible.
