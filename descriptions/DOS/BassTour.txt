The player fishes for a six hour session each day, in game time not real time, and all catches must be weighed in before the end of the day, failure to weigh in means no credit for all that work. In addition the players must manage their fuel and battery power to ensure they are not left stranded on the lake and select the correct rod and bait for the environment.
To aid the fisherman/woman they are given a boat which is equipped with a motor, fixed amount of fuel, chart recorder, rod & tackle boxes etc. The player can fish in six different lakes in the basic version of the game and the computer places the fish in realistic locations depending on the lake's topography.
