Mickey Dugan, "The Yellow Kid", is the lead character of Hogan's Alley, arguably the first ever American comic strip, dating as far back as 1895. The short story of this video game adaptation follows Mickey as he wanders around the New York City suburbs looking for ways to earn enough cash for a circus ticket.The Yellow Kid is an adventure game with a few action elements. A single interaction command is used for picking up objects or talking to NPCs, while picked-up items can be used from an inventory screen. There are a couple of arcade sequences that require timing or jumping. The game can be played entirely with the keyboard, though partial mouse control is also available.
