The invertebrate Willy has just finished his first adventure, and now it's time to go home to Mommy. The sequel to Willy the Worm builds on the Donkey Kong-inspired platform gameplay of its predecessor. The game includes twelve levels (now arranged in a linear sequence from left to right), featuring more colorful and more detailed graphics, and new traps such as destructible ladders and pits.
