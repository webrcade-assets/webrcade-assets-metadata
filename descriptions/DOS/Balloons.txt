Balloons is a very simple game aimed at very young children with the aim of teaching them that computers can be fun.The game is as simple as the player hitting a key, the game then draws a balloon of random colour and size. All keys make a sound when pressed so playing simple tunes is an activity the child can do. The child can also use the up and down arrow keys, hitting the DOWN ARROW causes the balloon to shrink while the UP ARROW causes the balloon to grow and eventually pop whereupon it makes a sound and releases a lovely rainbow.- On systems with EGA & VGA monitors, pressing G,B,R,Y,W makes green, blue, red, yellow or white balloons- On systems with CGA monitors, pressing the Y, G, R keys makes yellow, green or red balloons
