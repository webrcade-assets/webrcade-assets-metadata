The game controls very similarly to the original Tomb Raider, with keyboard-only "tank controls". Gameplay consists of environmental puzzles and platforming. Available moves include running, jumping, grabbing ledges and either pulling yourself up or shimmying along them.The game has many different versions. It was designed to run on DOS but has also been ported to Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android.
