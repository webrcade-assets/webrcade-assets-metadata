Crillion '97 is an arcade puzzle game inspired (obviously) by Crillion. Instead of a ball, here the player controls a tiny character called Crillion who jumps around and breaks blocks with his head. The objective of each level is to clear all breakable blocks from the screen before the time runs out.The basic playing mechanics are the same as in the original Crillion : the character bounces up and down, and the player can only control the horizontal direction of Crillion's movement. To break a block, the character must be of the matching colour, which can changed by touching a special block with a coloured circle. There are also instant death blocks that should be avoided, movable blocks etc. Additionally, Crillion '97 introduces several new features, like bonus items that may be picked up for extra points, and roaming monsters that should also be avoided unless the player wears the matching colour, in which case touching a monster destroys it.Crillion '97 was developed using the Allegro library and released as freeware. The author claims to have never played the original Crillion, having learned about it from a German computer magazine that featured the Amiga 500 conversion of the game.
