The premise behind Time Treks is that someone has invented a time machine which has allowed so-called "time tyrants" to escape into the past and wreak havoc. You need to stop these time tyrants using your knowledge of history (and the information contained within the program) to solve various challenges. Some of these are point and click style mini-games, while others are tests of knowledge, trivia style.
