MÃ©morise is a memory game advertised for children aged three to eight. The goal is to memorise a board of six objects along a determined amount of time (more or less according to the difficulty level selected) and then place these objects in the correct position on an empty board. The player can select the length of the game (from 3 to 24 boards to play) and the difficulty level (between six levels).
