Zmeelov (Змеелов is Snake Catcher in Russian) is a falling block puzzle, where the blocks are snakes of different kind and length. The main gameplay difference from the classic “Tetris” is the ability to freely change the shape of snakes. They are crawling on their landing, and eliminating the snakes of the same kind already landed and collided with the current ones. Later the original game idea was enhanced and released as WildSnake.
