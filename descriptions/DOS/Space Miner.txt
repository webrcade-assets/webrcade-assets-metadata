Humanity's hunger for material resources has expanded beyond Earth's capacity to satisfy it, and you've been sent on a mining expedition to harvest ores in space.  Your ship is equipped with a finite supply of fuel, a robot arm to collect materials, and twin missiles to fend off the hordes of slavering aliens which inconveniently occupy the area (and devour everything in their path, mining ships included). Floating lumps of fuel or missile modules can be collected to replenish your supplies.Your goal is to complete three mining runs with as much profit as you can - the mothership will be waiting to pick you up at the end of each run; if a ship is destroyed before being picked up, all of its hard-earned bounty will be lost.
