Pea Shootin' Pete is an extended re-release of Spit Wad Willy. The gameplay stays exactly the same, but this game adds background music and a practice mode. Additionally the background graphics have been altered, the number and placement of the ball(s) is sometimes slightly different and the main character is called Pete.
