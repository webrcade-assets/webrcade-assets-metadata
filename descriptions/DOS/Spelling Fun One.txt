You have been locked in a castle by Erlking of Errors, the Spelling Serpent.  You must move through all the rooms in the castle until you can find the Key of Gold and escape.  To move between rooms a word is flashed on the screen and begins to fade away.  You must correctly type the word to proceed to the next room.  Once you have built up enough strength (points) some rooms will have teleporters to move up to higher floors.  The gold key is hidden in one of three tower rooms at the very top of the castle.  Once the gold key has been found, you must find your way back to the first room in the castle where you can exit and finish the game.
A number of word lists are included of varying difficulty, and custom word lists can be created.
