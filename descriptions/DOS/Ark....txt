Ark... is a donationware Breakout variant. In this game, the player controls a paddle to reflect a ball toward blocks. Successful hits vaporize the blocks, except for special blocks that either require two hits or cannot be broken at all. Each level also features a special item that rewards bonus points when hit. The item is almost instantly replaced, although it may appear at a different spot. If the player fails to position the paddle correctly for the ballâ€™s return, they lose a life. The game ends when all lives are depleted, and the goal of each level is to clear all breakable blocks. There are 33 levels, all of which can be selected after starting the game. After beating level 33, the game loops back to the first level
