The evil overlord Bytor and his supreme wizards have stolen The Ankh. This Ankh is said to have incredible powers if unleashed and in the hands of such an evil would be devastating to the entire galaxy. As Wally, the space flier, your job is to survive the harsh planets you must traverse through and recover The Ankh before they use it to their evil means.Orion Odyssey is a platform action game story told in eight parts. As Wally you must monitor your four stats; health, oxygen, fuel, and ammo while taking on the robots and aliens strewn across and beneath the landscape. You are equipped with a blaster weapon and a jetpack which besides walking around is your primary mode of transportation.The jetpack is your only means of leaping so keep an eye on that fuel gauge. Your weapons can be upgraded by finding artifacts and pressing the appropriate key to unlocking their powers. Fuel canisters, shields and health power-ups are also laid out all over the landscape you play in. You will also see that there is a Gold gauge which you'll need to collect so that you may purchase necessities from pods you may run into.Alien and robotic foes aren't your only concern when it comes to keeping your health gauge up as flying too quickly into a wall will also cause damage or may even kill. Flying the jetpack requires practice and skill. A meter gauge shows the amount of inertia you have left so the jetpack will not allow you to fly across the entire level.Once the artifacts of a certain world have been collected you must return to the teleporter you started at to continue onto the next world. Other worlds will present different terrains and alien species and varying levels of oxygen density so remember to keep an eye on that oxygen gauge.
