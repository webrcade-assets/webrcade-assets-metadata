Like the first set, this installment features two games that flex the player's mathematical skills. This time both are based on puzzles, which must be solved within the chosen number of turns (at adjustable difficulty levels).Discovery Machine : one or two players face off against the titular apparatus, which takes a number, applies a hidden formula and prints the result. The contraption displays a sample input/output pair, and your task is to find out the formula. For each input shown, you'll have to guess the result; if you get it right three times in a row, you win.Number Chase : a Mastermind -style code-breaking game - the player has to guess a series of digits, and gets an evaluation after each turn. Two human opponents may play each other; in the single-player version, the computer can (optionally) join in as an AI opponent, and take a stab at guessing the human player's number on its own.
