GinRummy is a simulation of Gin Rummy. It's one-player only, with mouse support (it will fall back to keyboard if a mouse is not detected). It supports both color and monochrome monitors. It also keeps track of statistics between games, and can track statistics for up to 20 player names. Finally, the middle mouse button will provide a hint. This uses the same algorithms that the computer player uses.Options include setting the gin value, undercut, score limit, Oklahoma rules, and knocking, as well as quality of life features like big cards, pointer types, and being able to set the game to easy mode.The game was distributed as shareware, but without any locked features.
