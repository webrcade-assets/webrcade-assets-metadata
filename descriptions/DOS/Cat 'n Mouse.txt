Cat n' Mouse is an educational arcade game for multiple systems.The player controls a mouse which must navigate though multiple mazes, while trying to avoid the cats which stalk about the maze. Interspersed through the maze are dog spaces, which provide temporary protection from cats. When landing on a dog space, the player must answer a yes/no question, by looking at the word on the top of the screen and seeing if it matches the two pictures displayed on the screen. The dog must either shake its head yes or no to answer the question correctly. The player gains points for each correct dog answer and maze cleared. The player starts with a total of 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost. The player can make their own custom images and set gameplay difficulty and challenges.
