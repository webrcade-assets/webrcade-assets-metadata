Bombs and Bugs is a local multiplayer Bomberman clone, created as a clean-room reimplementation of the original games - the author hadn't played any of the series' games himself. It features support for up to four human or KI players and multiple included tilesets (with the option to download new tilesets in later versions).Each player controls one of the name-giving bugs, the goal is to be the last bug standing. The bugs will be killed when they are hit by the explosion of a bomb which the players will place on the playing field - but it's also possible to blow oneself up when not being careful. In the beginning most tiles are blocked by items which have to be bombed away to reach the other players. Not all tiles can be destroyed, though, providing some protection from exploding bombs. Destroyed tiles may drop power-ups which can be picked up by any player, e.g. to increase the power of the explosion, decrease the time until a new bomb can be placed or change the time until a placed bomb explodes.Aside from the graphics one notable difference compared to the Bomberman series is the behavior of the bombs, as they will destroy all destructible tiles within their range (i.e. if the bomb has a range of three fields, then the explosion will not stop after the first destroyed block, but destroy all destructible blocks (and extras) three fields to the left, right, top and bottom).
