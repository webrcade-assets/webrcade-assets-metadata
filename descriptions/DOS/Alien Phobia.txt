Alien Phobia is a single-screen shooter. There are exactly three moves available: walking forward (arrow key up), turning around (arrow key left and right) and shooting (enter, holding the key results in constant fire). Aliens enter the screen from all directions and the goal is to kill as many as possible before the player is inevitably overwhelmed. Sometimes a killed alien leaves behind a flame thrower which allows to kill aliens more effectively - as soon as the ammo is used up, the player automatically switches back to the standard pistol with unlimited ammo. When the player is defeated (there is a health bar which is depleted when an alien is touched), the game ends and maybe the player can enter a name into the highscore list. Only the number of killed aliens is relevant for this.
