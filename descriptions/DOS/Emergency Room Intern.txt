Emergency Room Intern is the second game in the fairly long-running Emergency Room series by Legacy Interactive, released two years before Emergency Room 2. In this one, the player starts as an intern at Legacy Hospital, and is trying to rise through the ranks and eventually become the hospital Chief of Staff.
Gameplay is similar to other Emergency Room titles - the player needs to diagnose patients through examination and various tests, and then prescribe the appropriate treatment. The game contains 50 all-new detailed cases, each of which is expected to take approximately 30 minutes to successfully treat.
