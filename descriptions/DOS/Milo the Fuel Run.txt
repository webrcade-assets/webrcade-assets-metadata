Milo: the Fuel Run is a side scrolling platform game with you being a skater trying to save the world's supply of the chocolate malted beverage Milo. You must skate/jump/grind through various levels collecting tins of Milo, stomping bad guys and finding new tricks in order to reach the end of each stage, many of which have a boss. Can you stop the evil doctor and his dastardly evil plan to steal all the Milo in the world?
Powerups you can find:
- Skateboard - collecting this earns you a extra life.

Milo tin - collect these to increase your health.

1st ollie - allows you to jump high on your skateboard.

2nd ollie - allows for a even bigger groovy ollie then before

tricks+grinds - allows grinding on certain objects to avoid damage.

Flips - allows you to flip your board and (possibly?) deal more damage to bad guys
