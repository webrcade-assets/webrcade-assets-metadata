Hugo III: Jungle of Doom is the third and final installment in the EGA adventure series. The game features the same engine as in previous Hugo games, along with some new features. These include a turbo button, and a "hints" feature. 
In this game, Hugo and his girlfriend Penelope crash in a jungle somewhere in South America, where Penelope is soon bitten by a poisonous snake. As Hugo, the player must venture through the jungle, confront a witch doctor and try to find the "pool of life".
The Hugo series later received a fourth installment, this time in the form of a 3D first person shooter, Nitemare-3D.
