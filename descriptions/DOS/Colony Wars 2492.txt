These 27 parts are divided in 3 components – weapon, vehicle and special. The robots were built in 3 factories (for every component you need another factory). The factories need the resource Angarium, which must be collected from the planet’s surface. In Colony Wars 2492 is no base management. The factories and all other buildings are on the map and must be conquered.The maps have one of 4 different surfaces (snow, desert, etc.).
