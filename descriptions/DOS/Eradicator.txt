The planet Ioxia is vital to your society, as nowhere else provides the vital element Mazrium. However, its long dormant alien forces have been woken up, and must be destroyed by a one-man army. You must fly into the Citadel to destroy its power source.
Eradicator combines first-person shooter action and puzzle solving, with an ability to toggle 3-rd person view. There are 20 different weapons, with the missiles you control after launching perhaps the most unusual. The single-player levels plus five more are all available for multi-player action.
Three distinct characters are on offer: choose from Kamchak the lizard or humans Dan and Eleena. The first levels of the game vary depending on which character you choose.
