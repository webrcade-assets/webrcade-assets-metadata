War Planets: Age of Chaos is a real-time strategy game directly based on the Trendmaster's War Planets toy line. It offers four armies each with their own planet, fighting each other. Krag are based on Rock, Biowolf on Bone, Kryos on Ice, and Darkones on the planet Beast. For each race scenario there are three practice levels followed by a normal level, and then a new one is opened up after each win. Each planet consists of three defense levels and then six ones were the other planets need to be weakened and defeated.
At the start of the game units are requisitioned ahead of time and are called in via a teleporter pad. Moving is done with a right click, shooting with the left mouse button. The troops need to be positioned carefully as they hurt each other when they are in a line of friendly fire. Only one unit can be moved at a time. Six types of units are offered per planet, and the amount that can be brought in depends on the energy available for teleportation. Missions generally revolve around defending or conquering a facility.
Rock has access to a mine tower, hovercraft, stealth tank, dozer, hero, and drone. Bone deploys a missile launcher, disk thrower, war dog, sawblade tank, hero, and drone. Ice enters battles with a jump jet launcher, death spinner, tank, grappletank, hero, and drone. Finally, Beast uses a darkjet launcher, darkwhaler, darktank, darklord, darkhero, and a drone.
