Having recovered Grelminar's Staff in Dark Designs I: Grelminar's Staff, a group of adventurers must now journey to Mount Delkeina, traverse the dangerous tunnels there, defeat an evil warlord, and close the dimensional gate he is using to build an army of monsters. This sequel features the same gameplay as its predecessor, though some minor enhancements have been made, like giving clearer names to spells and pooling gold for the whole party rather than giving it to individual characters. It is possible to import a party from the previous game or to start over with new characters.
