Diamond is a simple Boulder Dash variant. The player character is an adventurer whose aim is to grab as many diamonds as possible from the mines in the Andes. Here, corporations had built automated mines to extract the diamonds, but these are now abandoned and haunted by an ancient spirit called Xathe. Only brave adventurers such as the player character dare enter the mines in the hopes of navigating the perilous tunnels to get rich.The goal of each level is to collect a fixed amount of diamonds and reach the exit. Additional diamonds above the given quota may be collected for extra points, as there is no time limit. There are various hazards such as boulders that may fall and crush everything beneath, mining equipment that runs amok, and ancient spirits.Diamond was released as freeware by its author, and includes a built-in level editor.
