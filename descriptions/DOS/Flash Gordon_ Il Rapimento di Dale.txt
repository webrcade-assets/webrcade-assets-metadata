Flash Gordon and Dale Arden board Dr. Zarkov's rocket ship to reach a planet on a collision course with the Earth. Upon crash-landing on the mysterious planet, Flash and Dale face the minions of Ming the Merciless, who plans to take Dale as his bride. Flash avoids capture and must find outside help in order to enter the fortress and rescue Dale.This action adventure was produced by the Flash Gordon comic publisher for Italy and distributed through newsagents just like the comics. As Flash, the player wanders the alien planet across fixed two-dimensional screens. The game has an emphasis on combat, with frequent monster encounters that can be dealt with using bare hands or a laser pistol. The standard basic interaction, inventory and multiple-choice dialogue are on offer. However, unlike later adventure games by Holodream, the cursor does not change shape when hovering over an object of interest, thus requiring a degree of pixel hunting.
