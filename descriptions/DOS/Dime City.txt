Dime City, a fictitious American town in the last 30 years of the last century, is the scene of this business simulation in the gangster environment. With one of 4 companies you try to reach your aims â€“ being governor and godfather of Dime City. With (bank-)raids, blackmails or prostitution you raise your money. With the money you can buy cars and people for your crime-activities, stocks or immovables. Worth mentioning are the sudden attacks to your competitors. These are little top-down action games.
