Building Perspective is a logic game for multiple systems.
The player can view an array of buildings from either the left, right, front, or back. Taller buildings will obscure shorter buildings, and not all buildings can be seen from any one viewpoint. Buildings range in height from 1 - 9. The player attempts to guess which building is in each position, and place them from a top-down perspective. The player can work with a 3 x 3, 4 x 4 , or a x 5 array of buildings, with the challenge being progressively more difficult with a larger array. All commands are via keyboard, with menu commands to choose from different gameplay options.
