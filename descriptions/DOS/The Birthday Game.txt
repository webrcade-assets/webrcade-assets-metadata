This is a puzzle platforming game. You control the Birthday Mobile, which has both wheels and a levitator, and are tasked with collecting cake ingredients from each level. Remember that you can't collect ingredients not found in a cake, and you can't fall off any ledges or disconnect your levitator without your wheels on the ground. Messing up means you'll need to restart the level.
This game was released as Shareware. The registered version includes a codewheel that lets you complete the game, the ability to add a custom message to the game, and a level editor.
