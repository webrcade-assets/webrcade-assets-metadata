Creep Clash is a 2D fighting game that pits 3D polygon "creeps" against one another in a battle to reign as the next Lord of Necrovania. Players can choose one of four creeps: Pumpkin Pyre, Lugwin Van Vampirebat, Frankenclod, and Demon Spawn. Each character can perform multiple moves and one character-specific attack. Creep Clash's battles take place at midnight at the "Ancient Battleground of the Mists of Cemetoria."To complete the game, players must assume leadership of the creeps by defeating every other character in combat, thus opening the Great Door to the Living on Halloween night.Creep Clash features three different modes of fighting: player vs. computer, player vs. player, and training mode. The game's graphics consist of polygon graphics for characters fighting over non-interactive static backgrounds. Creep Clash features MIDI background music, and a lengthy graphical introduction with still pictures and digital voiceovers.
