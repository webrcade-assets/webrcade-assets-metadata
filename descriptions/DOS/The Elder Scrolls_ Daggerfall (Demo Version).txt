One of the earliest interactive demo versions of The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall includes a single unique dungeon called the Pit of Jagadha. The demo also has built-in preview features, including interactive demonstrations of the character generator, spell maker, item maker and potion maker, none of which however affect actual demo gameplay.Only one character is available for play in the demo, which is a pre-generated 16th level male Breton Spellsword called Magni Ersthaven. Some of the character's attributes, as well as the starting equipment are generated randomly each time the player enters the dungeon. The layout of the dungeon itself is always the same, but types and locations of certain monsters change when the game is restarted. The character may not level up but is able to change equipment and use an array of powerful high-level spells from the spellbook.Being based on a very early build of Daggerfall, the demo features numerous differences from the final release of the game, noticeable in the interface, graphics and certain game mechanics. Some of the game features are disabled, and there is no way to save or load a game in progress.
