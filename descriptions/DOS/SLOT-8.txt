The game SLOT-8 is a simulation of an 8-way pay slot gambling machine.
You are presented with the slot machine screen, and a starter capital of $100. Betting is 1-8 dollars, the bet is increased with the spacebar. Enter-key pulls the handle, and the symbols randomly change with accompanying noise. Winning combinations/patterns are presented on the right of the screen. Depending on how much you bet, your score is added from different rows, i.e. if you bet $1, only the middle horizontal row is counted, and if you bet $8, all rows, columns and diagonals are counted for matching patterns. The active rows are indicated with highlighted numbers on the left and top of the screen.
Each time you win, there is a musical tune played, different for every pattern. If you lose all your money, the game is over. If you win enough, you end up on a scoreboard.
