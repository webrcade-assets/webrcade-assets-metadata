Pride and Prejudice is a 1–6 player computer game of courtship and romance in Regency England.
Each game is played over a 15 week period, where each turn represents 1 week.  Each player creates a female character between the ages of 21–30, who is a poor but honest spinster.  Their families have raised a sufficient sum of money for them to attend London high society for a 15-week period; they will attend one major social event weekly.  Their goal is to earn an offer of marriage from one of the six available bachelors of varying degrees of wealth, or be banished to a life of loneliness or cheerless country marriage.
The player competes against various human and computer opponents.  Each character has statistics in the essential characteristics of beauty, wit, ballroom dancing, equestrian ability, and musicianship.  There are three levels of computer difficulty, and bachelors have an unknown level of appreciation of female abilities and inclination to marry, both of which must be overcome to achieve a marriage proposal.
Each week the player receives offers to tutoring, gossiping with the Duchess, or attending social events.  During different social events the player can demonstrate their abilities to those attending, with skill level determining the impression made. During play, the player can receive hints on other male or female's characteristics from gossiping with the Duchess of Elderberry.  They can also spread disparaging rumors regarding other Spinsters at that time.  Men disinclined to marriage may unexpectedly book passage to India during these 15 weeks.
At the end of each game, each player is given a score based upon the compatibility, age, and wealth of their marriage.
