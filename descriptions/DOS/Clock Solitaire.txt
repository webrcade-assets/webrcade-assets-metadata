In these days where card games abound and compilations can contain hundreds of games it's easy to forget that it was not always so.
Clock Solitaire is a single player, shareware game consisting of just one solitaire variant. It is played entirely with the mouse, the player clicks on the pack to deal and then moves cards around to their corresponding position in a clock face arrangement. This form of solitaire is one where there is very little strategy, success or failure depends entirely upon the deal of the cards.
