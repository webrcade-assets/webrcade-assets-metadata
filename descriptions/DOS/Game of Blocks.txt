Game of Blocks is a single-player block moving puzzle.The game window consists of two parts. The lower part is a wide low picture wall, there are six to choose from, and the upper part is used by two flying 'brickbats' one good and one bad. When the game starts the image in the lower part of the screen is converted to blocks and scrambled. Using the arrow keys and the spacebar the player manoeuvres the good brickbat to pick up blocks and drop them into position to reassemble the original image. While they are doing this the bad brickbat is also moving blocks around randomly as well as trying to kill the player's good brickbat by dropping blocks on them.The game is entirely keyboard controlled. This game was redeveloped for Windows by its author, the later version was renamed Brickbats.
