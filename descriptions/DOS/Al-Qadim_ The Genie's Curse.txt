The gameplay alternates between visiting friendly areas, where the hero can talk to characters (including choices of dialogue lines and moral behavior), and exploring dungeons, where enemies must be fought in action-based combat. The hero can use melee weapons, a slingshot for ranged attacks, or cast magic spells. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies; the player can raise the statistics of the protagonist should he gain a level. Acquiring special items and training may also permanently increase certain attack parameters.
