Slime is an adaptation of Ataxx. This board game takes place on a 7x7 square board, with both players starting with two pawns in the opposite corners. Each turn, a player can move one of his pawn two spaces away, or clone a pawn onto an adjacent square. Putting a pawn next to an opponent's pawns converts them to the player's pawns. The game is finished when one of the players has no more pawns, or when the board is filled completely, at which point the player with more pawns wins. Some squares on the board are blocked and inaccessible to either player; their layout in each game is chosen randomly. There is a 20 second limit for the human players to move.The game offers both human-vs-human and human-vs-computer (with three difficulty levels) play, as well as the option to pit two computer players against each other. During the game the player can pass a turn (up to five times), or ask the computer for a hint as to which pawn should he move next.
