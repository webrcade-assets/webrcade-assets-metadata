Choo Choo Minder is a puzzle game consisting of 45 levels. On each level the player should compose a train of carriages in proper order, controlling a locomotive and toggling the railway switches. The wagons need to be moved along the track so that they are eventually attached to the locomotive in a certain order. Wagons can be pushed by train or pulled by train. Some intersections of rail tracks are equipped with switches, changing the position of which selects the direction of further movement. For the successful completion of the level, it is necessary that the correctly assembled train left for the main line and went to the previously specified direction. Moreover, this should be done in a natural way - headfirst, when the locomotive drags the cars behind it, and does not push them backwards. To complicate the task, another train periodically passes along the main road, which may collide with a train and then the level will have to start anew. The game may be saved in progress to restore it later. Scores are given for the faster solution of the puzzle. Top scores are stored in top six table.
