You're Restless Ralph Runabout, hunting for Dr. Sleeptite in his Nightmare Factory deep beneath the Mojave desert, where the mad scientist is working on his latest invention: a machine for creating nightmares.  Six levels of this underground complex await, as chock-full of ladders, platforms and fire-poles as any arch-villain's lair.  Complete each stage by collecting all of the good Doctor's Nightmare Capsules and reaching the exit door - but be sure to avoid Sleeptite's loyal henchmen, the horrendous Killer Pillows, who would love nothing more than to torment you in the night...
