In this game the player controls Joshua, the leader of the Jewish people after the death of Moses. Joshua must lead the Israelites into the Promised Land (Canaan), but there are many puzzles and obstacles that stand in his way - falling rocks, hostile soldiers and other things. Using his horn and other special weapons to defeat enemies, Joshua will face some of the nations mentioned in the Bible, such as the Hitties, the Amorites, the Gibeonites, and the Gezerites.
