SLASH'EM is a NetHack variant that continues the development of an earlier variant, SLASH. As such, it is essentially similar to NetHack, but expands the game with new player roles, races, monsters and items. Additionally, SLASH'EM incorporates the high-resolution graphical user interface from AllegroHack, offering three graphical modes: large isometric tiles, large top-down tiles and small top-down tiles.
Like SLASH, SLASH'EM is a backronym that stands for Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic. The game is free and open source, with "official" binaries provided by the author for several platforms, along with the source code.
