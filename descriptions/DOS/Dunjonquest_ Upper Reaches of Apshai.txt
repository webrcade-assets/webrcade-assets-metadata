Upper Reaches of Apshai is an expansion module for Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai, featuring a new dungeon (four levels with 150 rooms), and even something like a background story: You have to discover the secrets of Benedict's monastery and the cottage of Merlis the Mage.Otherwise, gameplay is pretty much the same and resembles other graphical Roguelikes / mainframe DND-Clones: You're in control of a solo character, running through a dungeon, killing monsters, getting experience, evading traps and finding treasures.
