This freeware, fan-made sequel to Spear of Destiny comes with all-new sprites, weapons, and exploding barrels.
Want to find out what really happened to Adolf Hitler after the war? Why his body was never recovered? What did the Nazis do after escaping persecution? Who got hold of the so-called powerful mystical Spear of Destiny? This game boasts 23 levels including secret ones.
In 2011 the game was ported to Windows using SDL, allowing it to run natively on modern PCs using a wide range of higher resolution graphics. To mark the game's 10th anniversary, this conversion was accompanied by an all-new map-set for extra challenge, though the original 2001 maps can still be used.
