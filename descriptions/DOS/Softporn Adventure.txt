This is an unofficial port of the original version.
The game was made by the developer based on his admiration for the Apple II version. The developer was able to recreate that version faithfully since he had a printout of the original Applesoft Basic code to base his version on. It was so faithful to the original version that Al Lowe even contacted him and requested this version be on Leisure Suit Larry's Greatest Hits and Misses!.
