Star Fortress is an unofficial PC conversion of the popular arcade game Star Castle. The player controls a small spaceship that is attacking the large and heavily defended Star Fortress, which is protected by several layers of energy shields and can launch homing torpedoes or fire a powerful blast from its main cannon. Both of these attacks can obliterate the player's ship in one hit, so the objective is to avoid these attacks while using the cannon to pound through the shields and ultimately destroy the fortress. After successfully doing so, the situation repeats itself, but with increasingly more dangerous enemy behaviour, which is typical of arcade games. The playing field takes up the entire screen and wraps around, meaning that if the player or the torpedoes go beyond any of the screen's borders, they will immediately emerge at the opposite side of the screen, which allows for some tricky manoeuvring by the player.Star Fortress was originally marketed as shareware, but as of 2006 the full version is available as a free download from the author's website.
