SIMSpace is a single player, shareware, space, 'flight and combat simulator'. The object of the game is to complete as many missions as possible, the game ends when the player 'dies' or when they have failed three missions.
The action takes place on the bridge of a starship. Missions are received from Space Force HQ on the main screen which the player must then execute. While the game may cut away to show brief scenes there is effectively only one screen on this game and that is the bridge of the starship. All the controls the player needs to navigate, fight, defend, communicate, etc are there together with the game controls to save, exit, and match the game to the speed of the player's CPU.
The game's features include a boss key, over fifty types of mission, game editors, modem play and more.
