The famous crazy-scientist Dr. Bacterio was experimenting with hens to let them grow to the size of a horse, thus trying definitively to end the hunger in the world.  But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the city putting eggs on the street.  But certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the egg crushes on his head.
This is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the famous Ibañez's comicbook saga, "Mortadelo y Filemón", known as "Clever & Smart" or "Flip & Flop" outside Spain.
