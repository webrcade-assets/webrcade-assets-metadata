Journey To The Centre Of The Earth! is a single player game which has nothing to do with the Jules Verne classic. This game, episode one in a trilogy, was released as shareware while the other games ;* Episode 2 : Adventures at the Centre of the Earth, andEpisode 3 : Escape From the Centre of the Earth!had to be purchased.In this game the player takes control of a character that looks like a ball with four legs sticking out of it who from the planet Cranium. The home planet is in trouble, civilisation is declining, so your world leader has sent you on a mission to collect ten things from Earth. These items are knowledge, life, wisdom, prosperity, youth, honour, health, happiness love & peace, each item corresponding to a new level of the game.The items are hidden beneath the surface of the Earth and the player must guide their character through the underground maze to find them. Armed only with a laser the player must manoeuvre around the machinery that makes the world work and avoid creatures who live in the maze as they search for the key object. Along the way the player can collect money. This is important as it enables the player to pick up usable items that may help or harm, (these are not documented and it is up to the player to work out which is which and just what effect they have).The player starts the game with two lives but during the game there are items which can bestow an additional life.
