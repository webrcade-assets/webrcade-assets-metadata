J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers is a role-playing game following the second book in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is a direct sequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I. Controlling multiple characters from the book, players struggle to reach the Two Towers on the ultimate quest to destroy the One Ring.The gameplay is quite similar to that of the first game. The players navigate the parties of characters over top-down environments, fighting enemies and performing quests. Since the storyline of the second book splits into several independent journeys of different characters, the game also switches between different controllable parties.
