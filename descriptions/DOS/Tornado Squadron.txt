Tornado Squadron is a combat flight simulator that was created with Domark and Simis's Flight Sim Toolkit (FST) construction set. As a Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot of a Tornado IDS fighter-bomber, the player is tasked with various missions during a fictional conflict with unspecified "hostile intruders" that threaten Britain's home territory. The theatre of operations comprises several islands with friendly and enemy airfields and other installations. Playable scenarios range from base defence to air support to tactical strikes against enemy ground targets.The game has ten missions, with some starting on the runway and others in mid-air, at various day or night hours. Scenarios are launched from a graphical user interface that is originally not part of the FST toolkit or engine, being a slightly simpler version of the interface menu found in Jaguar GR1, another FST game by the same author. For example, mission briefings are displayed as simple DOS text messages with no graphical background. Similar to Jaguar GR1, the main menu also allows to view some of the 3D models of planes used in the game.Tornado Squadron was released as freeware by its author.
