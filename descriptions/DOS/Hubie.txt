Hubie is a single player platform puzzle game, where you control a small round figure (named 'Hubie') with legs and antennas.The game puts Hubie in a series of rooms with block obstacles between him and an exit, and the objective is to push, break or bypass these objectives in whatever way possible and get to the exit for the next room - there are 17 rooms in the unregistered version, registering the game adds 100 more plus some new objects like mirrors that can reflect light beams.Hubie can break some objects by banging against them, he can push objects (but not pull them - only magnets can do that) by blowing air-puffs against them, he can climb objects, and also use his antennas as helicopter-like rotors for short flights. Springs can be used as trampolines to jump higher, and there are also balloons, fans, explosives and magnets among other things to move objects and help Hubie escape the rooms.
