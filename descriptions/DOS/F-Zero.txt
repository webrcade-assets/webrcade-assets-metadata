F-Zero is a fan game based on the SNES game of the same name. It offers the same kind of futuristic hovercar racing as the original, but with high-resolution (800x600) graphics, 3D-rendered cars and an assortment of tracks based on those from the original.The game includes four tracks, whose layout is based on the tracks from the original game, but with features like turbo and jump pads newly arranged. Gameplay also follows the original closely, with the car having limited power that is decreased on collisions but can be repaired in the repair area, turbo boosts awarded after a completed lap and finishing in the top positions necessary to advance, with only a limited number of lives available.
