Daehyeoljeon (Great Fighter) is a Korean-made versus fighting game.
There are only two modes in the game: one player versus computer AI and two-player mode; there is no story mode and no discernible background plot. Players can choose between eight available fighters: seven men and one woman. Each character has his or her own home court, usually a modern urban location such as city streets or fighting arena. Characters use traditional punches and kicks to fight each other; in addition, there are combination attacks that can be performed by combining jumping with the aforementioned moves. Attack and defense ratings as well as the game's speed can be customized in the options menu.
