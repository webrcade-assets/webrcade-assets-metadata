Little did you know, getting ready for a rest, that you'll be awoken by screams, lights going out, and your examiner being eaten alive by huge rabid rats!Psionics is a simple sci-fi dungeon crawler in which the player must escape from a maze-like space station. Apart from finding a couple of items that will help you in the way, you'll be often facing mutated animals, which you may defeat not only using weapons, but also your psionic powers.
