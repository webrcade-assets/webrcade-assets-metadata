Beer Trivia tries something that very few games (only Rockstar and BarneySplat come to mind) attempt: to simulate inebriation in textmode. It plays as a multiple-choice trivia game, with lurid questions such as adults of drinking age might exchange at a local tavern, with one difference: if you get a question wrong, you have to "take a drink". Who can get drunk on virtual booze, you ask? As the character gets progressively more and more smashed, more and more of the text characters are replaced by random garble (the game's billed "intoxication simulation!"), making it more difficult to interpret questions and identify even known answers. The more drinks your player consumes, the greater the chance they will pass out, getting turfed from the game until the following day. One further exceptional racy element is the player's ability to have the correct answer to a failed question displayed in exchange for the virtual removal of a virtual garment -- up to three per day, beyond which even the computer doesn't want to contemplate. For registered users (only $10!), six bonus packs of additional questions on various subjects were available to bolster the 75 questions that came with the shareware installment.
