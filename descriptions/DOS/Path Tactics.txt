Patch Tactics is a math strategy game for one or two players.Each player or a computer opponent controls a robot which must move across a series of numbered platforms. Each turn, the player is given three random numbers from 1 to 10, and must devise a true mathematical equation, with the number placed in the "move" square representing the number of positions a player will move forwards. The goal is to move across the entire board, and be the first player to reach the bottom of the screen from the top. If a player lands on a square occupied by another, that first player occupying the square is sent back 10 spaces. There are X's on the screen that will allow the player to drop down a level if they land on them. Players can compete with a variety of mathematical functions including counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
