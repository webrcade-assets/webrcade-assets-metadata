CyberBox is a puzzle game where the objective is to reach the exit in a series of rooms. Each room contains a series of 'sliders', which can be moved in the directions of the arrows, 'pushers' which automatically move boxes when able, 'zappers' which can only be traversed in one direction, and 'selectors' which can only be pushed via other blocks, but may or may not block the player. Unlike Soko-Ban or similar games, any number of 'sliders' in a sequence can be pushed, as long as the arrows line up properly.
There are 16 rooms in total to overcome before the game is complete. The game has a limited number of retries and will also end when out of retries. The game will record a score based on the number of moves used per puzzle for your attempt, where fewer moves is better.
