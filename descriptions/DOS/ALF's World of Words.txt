ALF’s World of Words is an educational game based on the TV cartoon ALF: The Animated Series. The game consists of three different word-related challenges, each following the same rules. Before starting, players select their desired difficulty level and the number of levels they wish to play. As they progress through the game, solving problems correctly earns them points: three points for a correct answer on the first attempt, and one point if they need a second try. After two incorrect answers, the game reveals the correct solution and moves on to the next question. The ultimate goal is to accumulate as many points as possible. Upon completion, players have the option to print out a certificate.Here are the three word games within “ALF’s World of Words”:Prefixes & Suffixes: In this challenge, players are presented with a word and must choose from four prefixes or suffixes to create a new word.
