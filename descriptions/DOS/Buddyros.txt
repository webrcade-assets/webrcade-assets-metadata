Buddyros is a logical game with simple rules. The game combines elements of Boulder Dash, Dyna Blaster and Sokoban. The goal is to collect all the keys from the board and get through to the exit door to the next level without getting killed. At each level (of which there are around fifty, but the built-in editor lets players create more) the player character may expect stones to crush him, antigravity and levitating stones, bombs, dynamite sticks, walls, wagging hammers and even sponges.
