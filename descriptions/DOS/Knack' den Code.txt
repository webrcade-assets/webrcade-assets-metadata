In this puzzle game you have to correctly guess a sequence of colors.You have six colors (white, blue, green, magenta, black, red) and four empty boxes. Selecting a color will place it into the empty box. Once all four colors are set, the game will compare it with the hidden set sequence and show you the amount of correctly placed colors and the number of colors which are in the sequence but at the wrong place. You now have five additional turns to correct your sequence so that it matches the hidden sequence. (Note: the same color can be used multiple times.)
