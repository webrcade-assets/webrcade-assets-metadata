Ruckus Poker is a card game simulation published as Volume Sixteen in the popular Coffee Break series. Four poker varieties are available: 5 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud, Chicago, and Hold 'Em. You can select one of them or just play a random game. There are three computer-controlled opponents to be chosen out of eight players with different bios and personalities. Two of them, sitting in front of you, are shown animated and will share their optional thoughts from time to time. On-line help is available, including the tutor who could be asked for a suggestion, as well as statistical tracking of every play with percentages of winning and losing hands.
