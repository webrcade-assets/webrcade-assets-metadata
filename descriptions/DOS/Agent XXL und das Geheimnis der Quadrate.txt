There have seldom been stranger ways of recruiting people: When espionage fan Gunter Bunt takes part in a competition put on by his favourite magazine "Top + Secret", he unexpectedly gets the message that he is chosen and hired as an agent with "XXL authority", and gets some spy equipment and a mission. His assignment is to find the four Magic Squares - ancient Aztecan artifacts - and rescue a fellow agent who went M.I.A. in search of the artifacts.
Agent XXL is commercial game which advertises the German chocolate brand Ritter Sport. The game is a classical point and click adventure with cartoony graphics and an apparent influence from LucasArts titles. You control Gunter on his quest to retrieve the Magic Squares and the missing agent. The interface is quite similar to Sam & Max with full-screen graphics and the usual commands (look, take, use,...), which are chosen by clicking the right mouse button.
