Spectrum Sorcery is a strategy game for two players (human or computer), based on Spectral Sorcery for the Atari ST. Two wizards fight on a grid of colored pads. Their goal is to change the entire grid to their own color.Each turn, a wizard gains energy, and can use that energy for various actions. Actions include pass (do nothing), move (move to an adjacent pad and stomp), stomp (change the color of the pad you're standing on to your color), convert (turns the pad you're standing on to your color), transmute (change all adjacent pads to your color), blitz (change the color of the pad you're standing on, and all adjacent pads (recursive) to your color), teleport (move to an arbitrary pad in the grid), lock (prevent changing the color of the pad you're standing on), unlock (break a lock on the pad you're standing on), release (remove all locks you've placed), and help (let the computer choose an action).There are multiple board layouts, from 5x5 to 10x10, as well as some odder variations. The game was distributed as Shareware, with no restrictions.
