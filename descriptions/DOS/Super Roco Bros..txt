Super Roco Bros. is a side-scrolling arcade platform game that is vaguely similar to Super Mario Bros., but not an exact copy. The player controls a cartoonish character called Roco Roco, a hot dog chef who is transported to an alternate dimension in search of his elder brother Pepe Roco. On his quest, Roco Roco will need to overcome numerous minions of his arch nemesis, the giant peanut Peano, before facing this threat himself.Gameplay consists of navigating the levels, collecting coins and defeating enemies by jumping on top of them.Super Roco Bros. was marketed as shareware. The shareware / demo version contains just four levels out of 16 in the registered game. It was created with the DIV Games Studio development kit, and shares similarities with the sample game The Castle of Dr. Malvado.
