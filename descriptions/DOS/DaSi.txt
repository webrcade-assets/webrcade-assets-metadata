Nothing less than a computerized spirit board (of which the Ouija is the best known), DaSi lets you commune with whatever technologically-savvy spirits may be channeling through the astral plane near you using an ordinary computer mouse as the planchette, spelling out messages letter by letter. It just lays down the infrastructure -- you've got to bring the spooks yourself.
