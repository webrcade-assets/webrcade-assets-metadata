Land of the Unicorn is an educational game for vocabulary practice that contains three activities: synonym review and quizzes, antonym review and quizzes and The Quest of the Silver Unicorn. The first two are for drilling and practising words while the third is the actual game.
In the quest game, the player controls a unicorn, Kelsany, who is looking for a magic necklace that will save his land from doom. The necklace can be found in one of five castles and the gameplay involves navigating through the maze-like gameworld and collect the keys that will open up each castle. As the player moves around the game will stop periodically and ask questions. There are multiple choice questions involving synonyms and antonyms and fill-in questions that involve anagrams. By answering questions correctly the player is awarded with gold. The gold is needed to pay bridge trolls who otherwise prevent the player from crossing rivers. The game ends when the player unlocks the door leading to the castle that contains the necklace.
