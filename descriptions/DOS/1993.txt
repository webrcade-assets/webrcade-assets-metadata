This New Year 1993-themed game features Santa Claus and his encounter of the third kind. Flying at the bottom of the screen, Santa Klaus throws wrenches from his sleigh to the rockets of two aliens flying at the top of the screen. The only player's action is "to throw a wrench", but it should be done taking into account the velocity of all the rockets, and the condition that more points are given if higher alien catches the wrench instead of lower alien. All wrenches caught by the aliens lead to the points for the player. Highest scores are stored in the top ten table.
