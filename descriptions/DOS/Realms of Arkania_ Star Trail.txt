The united orc tribes have attempted to invade the region of Thorwal, but their plans were foiled by a group of valiant adventurers during their earlier quest. However, the orcs have regrouped and are planning to attack another, more vulnerable area. An elf ambassador summons the party to the city of Kvirasim. It appears that an artifact known as the Salamander Stone has to be recovered in order to unite the races of the elves and the dwarves in the struggle against a common enemy. Yet not everything is as simple as it seems: as the party advances towards an abandoned dwarven mine that may hold the answers to their questions, someone else makes it clear that cooperation between the two races is not desired by everyone in the country.Star Trail is the second installment in a German-made role-playing series based on the RPG system Das Schwarze Auge ("The Dark Eye"). Visually and gameplay-wise, the game is very similar to its predecessor, with its pseudo-3D towns and dungeons, isometric battle screens, detailed options for tactical combat, as well as skill-based character creation and advancement. The sequel offers more side quests as well as more personalized and varied events during the party's travels, which often compel the player to make choices.
