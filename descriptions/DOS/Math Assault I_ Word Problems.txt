Math Assault I: Word Problems is a one or two player, shareware, educational title for grade levels 2 - 7.
The story behind the game is that the country of Greecia is a place where people live in darkness. Their land has been controlled by a god called Apathy for thousands of years. Zeus planned the downfall of Apathy by teaching the people the wisdom of numbers, this made them strong and they were able to overthrow the evil god and his minions and imprison them.
Now, a century later, the people have forgotten Zeus' teachings. Apathy and his crew are out of prison and the only hope for the future is a legendary warrior who will master the world of numbers and destroy all evil in the world.
The game is played in two parts. In the Chamber of Numbers the player must answer a series of math questions which are expressed in words rather than in symbols, hence the name Math Assault I: Word Problems. So instead of being asked, say, 2+2=? The player is given a question like 'Apollo has 2 goats and Zeus gives him 2 more, how many goats does Apollo now have?'
By answering correctly and quickly the player gains health points, weapons points, and possibly some of Zeus' bonus points. When the player has answered enough questions correctly they advance in rank and are allowed into the combat part of the game.
The combat part of the game is a two dimensional, scrolling, platform game in which the player must defeat each one of Apathy's minions until, on the eighth level, they defeat Apathy himself on Mount Olympus.
There are three levels of difficulty, a choice of six warriors - three male and three female, optional sound, a save game option and re-definable action keys. The developers claim the game will take between thirty and eighty hours to complete.
