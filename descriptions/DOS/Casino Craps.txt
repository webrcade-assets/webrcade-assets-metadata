The game simulates Casino Craps, a gambling variant of the dice board party game. The player joins the table with certain amount of money in cash and starts to play. There are three computer players and a stickman seated at the table. The player places various bets (Pass Line, Come Line, Free Odds, Place, Field, Hardways, Center Table) against the bank and tries to win as much money as possible. If the player runs out of money, the casino loans him more money, and the stickman is changed at the table. The rules of the board game are accessible via in-game help.
