In this game you are playing as a just elected mayor of the small Bavarian village Tupfingen. It is no serious political simulation but a snappy satire of the Bavarian lifestyle and their politics.
When you start your game you have to choose your political goals, e.g. support the agriculture or become the site of the Olympic Games. The most important businesses of Tupfingen are tourism, agriculture, small business enterprises and clubs. Of course every one of them wants you to support them and every one has lobbyists in the local council which have the power to foil your plans if dissatisfied. If that's the case you have to bribe your way to success - but not with official money but with the winnings of your butchery (which success depends also on the political situation).
Every round lasts a few minutes in which you have to adhere deadlines to every important decision which arises, e.g. negotiations with estate agents or potential investors. Also there is the matter of expanding the agenda for  the next local council meeting. On these meetings you have to enforce your plans against your political enemies - with arguments or bribes. A special gimmick are humorous videos from the German news magazine "heute journal" with the original newsreaders where they comment on your successes or failings.
The graphics are consisting solely of stills, Bavarian folk music accompanies you during the game.
