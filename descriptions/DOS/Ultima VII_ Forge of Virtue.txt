Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue is an add-on disk to Ultima VII: The Black Gate that adds new areas and quests to the game.
Once the disk is installed and a previous game is loaded (or a new one begun), an earthquake shakes Britannia, signalling the rising of the Isle of Fire from the oceans. The Isle was last seen in Ultima III, serving as the stronghold of Exodus. And while Exodus was destroyed, some of his essence remains in the Dark Core, which must be destroyed to rid Britannia of his evil once and for all. To accomplish this, several tests of virtue must be passed, originally designed by Lord British as part of the Quest of the Avatar.
The rewards of completing the add-on's quests are plentiful and can make the main game easier: the Avatar's stats will be raised to their maximum and a new, powerful weapon will be made available, able to vanquish even the most dangerous foes with a single strike.
