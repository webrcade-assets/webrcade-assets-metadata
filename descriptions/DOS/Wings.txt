Wings is a Thrust -style 2D cave-flyer shooter, played primarily as a multiplayer game but also featuring a single-player mode. Playable by up to eight players, either as teams or in free-for-all combat, the game involves each player flying a small, V-shaped ship, in a parallax-scrolling, physics-simulated environment, trying to defeat enemy players in various game modes.
Players can choose from several different ships, with varying flight and combat characteristics, and a large variety of different weapons and devices. The game features destructible environments (including both terrain collapse and burning), fluid dynamics (such as water flowing, spilling and pooling), and configurable physics simulation, including variable gravity and air resistance.
Wings can be played in split-screen, LAN, Internet, modem or serial multiplayer, and the author has released a modding tool for adding custom ships to the game. It is succeeded by a sequel, Wings 2.
