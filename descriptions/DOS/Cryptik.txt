Cryptik is a cryptic jigsaw puzzle. After dividing up the picture into pieces, the pieces are converted to only show the major colors. Swap pieces until all pieces are in the right place. Scoring is done by the number of swaps needed, and the number of hints used.The Shareware version comes with two VGA images. An additional SVGA picture was distributed separately due to space. The registered version removes the nag screen and includes two more images. The program accepts custom images.
