Animal is a product tie-in to Unilever brand Peperami, a spicy pork salami sausage. The 'Peperami Animal' was launched in 1993 advertising with the slogan 'It's a bit of an animal'.
This surreal adventure takes place in the town of Snackopolis, where tension between cookies, vegetables and other snack-creatures is on the rise. Just before the mayoral election, the current mayor and top candidate Dr. Pepereinstein is kidnapped while he is cloning Peperami. In addition, the cloning device was tampered with, with horrible results. As Peperami, a walking and talking sausage, you investigate and seek to rescue the mayor and to clean up the mess left from the cloning.
You explore over 130 hand painted locations around the city, talk to other snacks to find clues, solve puzzles, and fight the bad guys. The game is a traditional point and click adventure with the exception of two DOOM -style first-person shooter sections at the end of the game.
