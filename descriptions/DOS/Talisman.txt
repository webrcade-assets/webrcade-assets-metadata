Usually it displays a magnifying lens for "look", a hand for "use", and a chest for "take". Some objects have a candle to "ignite", doors have a "open" icon, and so on.
The inventory is always visible at the bottom of the screen. As the number of objects increase, it can be scrolled down with the right-side arrows.
Clicking in one of the characters initiate dialog, with a list of questions at the bottom replacing the inventory temporally. The main character can't move freely on the screen, he only goes from hotspot to hotspot. To make him leave a room, the player has to click on an exit and select the "exit" icon.
