Jane's Combat Simulations: Advanced Tactical Fighters is the sequel to USNF. The game uses the same engine as USNF, with updated aircraft shapes and terrain. One of the new features is a comprehensive Jane's research suite on all the game's aircraft, weapons, vehicles, ships, etc.
There are two campaigns (Egypt 1998 and Vladivostok Russia 2002), various of single missions, an in-game mission creator, and a quick mission creator. Replay value was further increased by Duosoft's toolkit, which allowed players to greatly modify the game with custom add-on libraries. The game focus is on futuristic aircraft and campaigns, with many of the flyable aircraft still in development at the time of the game's development. The flyable aircraft are F-117 Nighthawk (Stealth Fighter), F-22 Raptor, XF-29 FSW, XF-31 EFM, ASTOVL (JSF), B-2 Spirit and Rafale C.
