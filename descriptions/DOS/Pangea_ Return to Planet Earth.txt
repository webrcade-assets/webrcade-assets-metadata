Pangea: Return To Planet Earth is an interactive story told in comic strip format. It is the first episode in a series with Pangea: Purgatory planned as episode 2 though there is no evidence that this was ever released.
The story is set in the far future when the Pangea Corp has grown to such a size that it has absorbed all countries and runs 'The Order' which now governs the world. The population is divided into three main groups;* the privileged and productive who live under The Order's protection

the expendables who are basically the psychotic rejects, they live earth's the old cities which are now penal colonies
the rebels, often called moles, because they live underground now the Earth's surface is barren and hostile

Earth developed the faster than light drive in 2269 and has explored the galaxies. They have come into contact with the three main races that are out there - the Karaskians, Nikonians and Turborans. Among the people whose home is now the stars is Dak, some sort of space mercenary/trader. Dak's father was once the leader of the rebels and the story starts when Dak is asked to return to Earth, to negotiate a treaty between the rebels and the expendables.
This episode covers the events between Dak and his Nikonian companion approaching Earth orbit through to their preparation to set out to meet the leader of the expendables in a prison city called Purgatory.
The story has no sound such as music or effects as such but it does have a branching plotline and a bleep is used to alert the player when a plot choice has to be made. The game was programmed in MMGRASP - the MultiMedia GRaphic Animation System for Professionals
