Arcventure: The Romans is the first game in the Arcventure educational series that teaches kids aged seven to eleven about the ancient civilisations. This game focuses on the ancient Romans and how they lived.
The game takes players on a simulated archaeological dig based on the actual Woodchester site in Gloucestershire, unearthing a range of Roman artefacts, some of which they can identify using the built-in database and some of which require them to journey back to ancient Rome. When in Rome players can explore a Roman villa and question the Romans and Britons who work and live there. In this way, the ancient world is brought to life and the past is made as accessible as the present.
The game comes with a teacher's book, a teacher's book supplement, two maps and two expedition cards.
