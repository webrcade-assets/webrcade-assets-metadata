An updated take on both Pong and Quadrapong, where either two or four players bounce a ball around a square court; each player moves a paddle along one edge of the playfield. The game counts misses, so the objective is obviously to "score" lower than the opponent(s) by not letting the ball slip past your paddle. Optional features allow the playfield to rotate (as one might glean from the title), but also to zoom, wobble and display vectorized demo-style 3D effects.
