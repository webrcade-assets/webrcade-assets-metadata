Adventure Game Creator (later known as Adventure Game Studio) is a game engine for classic point-and-click adventures. Most importantly, it also comes with a demo game: Demo Quest.This short demo game exists to showcase the engine’s features. It was included since the first release and has grown over time alongside the engine’s feature set. The goal of the game is simple: traversing through the screens and solving one or two puzzles to open the closed door at the end. The UI closely mimics Sierra's SCI engine, featuring four icons (walk, look, use, talk) that change with a right mouse click and can be used to interact with items or characters. Hot spots are marked when moving the mouse over them. One of the screens scrolls while the others are split-screen.
