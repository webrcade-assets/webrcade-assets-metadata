Arcy 2 is a puzzle game in which the player takes control over a smiley face that has to solve several one-screen levels. To finish a stage, the player needs to collect all keys and then reach the exit. However, there are of course some obstacles to overcome, mostly in the form of enemies. These behave in predictable ways, e.g. spiders just move forward and turn left or right when reaching an obstacle or gogglers look in a direction and move towards the smiley when it moves into their sight. Other elements are stones (can be moved), water (can't be crossed, but filled up with stones), one-way streets or bonus balls which give additional points when collected.The game can be saved at any time, but the level restarts when loading it. There is no time limit, a limited amount of lives (every touch - or in the case of snakes, glimpse - is instant death) and a high score list.
