Janosik is an enhanced port of Atari game of the same title. Graphics and audio aspects were adapted to the 16-bit computers, boards entirely remodeled. The game introduced some new elements, like animated short scenes or new types of obstacles.
The game world is divided into forest, village and castle areas. Armed with a shepherd's axe and precise jumping ability Janosik must defeat all the enemies to free Maryna.
This platform game is loosely based on the story around Juraj Jánošík, a XVII / XVIIIc. Slovak highlander, leader of Carpathian brigands. In Poland the legend was revived by a popular TV series from 1970s, making him a fictional XIXc. gallant folk hero, who only robs the rich Austrian nobles to help oppressed local peasants, "Robin Hood way".
