Tommy's Crosswords is a single-player crossword game.
This game comes with thirty-nine pre-made crosswords and an editor so that players can create and share their own puzzles. In Solution mode it has two cheat modes, one gives the player the current letter, as indicated by the cursor, and the other gives the entire word. In Creation mode there's an optional encryption feature to prevent others cheating.
There are also two command line switches one to force a colour display and another to force a monochrome display.
