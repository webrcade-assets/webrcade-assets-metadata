The public demo version of CyberMage: Darklight Awakening includes a unique scenario that was specifically designed to demonstrate various aspects of the game, sample some of the weapons, vehicles and Darklight powers, and combat diverse enemies. The only aspect of the full game not present in the demo is interaction with NPCs and plot progression.
In the demo, the player's objective is to fight through a large mazelike complex in order to shut down a secret combat training facility. Weapons and power-ups are scattered throughout the area, and to improve Darklight powers the player might also need to find a temple and defeat its zealot guardians.
