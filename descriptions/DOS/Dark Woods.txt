Dark Woods is an ASCII turn-based game where the player controls a hero fighting against orcs. The goal is to clear out the enemies in each level while avoiding death. Some enemies can be defeated with the sword in close combat, while others have to be taken out with ranged weapons (that have limited ammo). The game has six levels and ammunition for ranged weapons does not carry over between them.
