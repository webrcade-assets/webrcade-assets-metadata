The hero in Bloxinies is none other than the extended-ASCII smiley face character - the one that holds the very first position in every self-respecting DOS codepage. This jovial figure is out on a hunt for gems, hidden throughout a series of puzzle-based rooms. The game borrows elements from both Sokoban and Boulder Dash : to finish a level, all crystals must be picked up to unlock the exit door; boulders can be pushed around and rearranged at will.
The treasure chambers have a major infestation of big, nasty spiders, which instantly kill anyone who wanders next to them; no more friendly are the dart-shooting contraptions that zap anything in their line of sight. Naturally, some cunning is required to get past these hazards and grab the valuables. No editor is included, but level maps are stored in a plain-text format, and the instructions to modify them (or creating new ones) are available.
