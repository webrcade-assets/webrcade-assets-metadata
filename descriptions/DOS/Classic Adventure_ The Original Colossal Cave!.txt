Classic Adventure: The Original Colossal Cave! is a version of the text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure developed by Will Crowther and Don Woods which has spawned so many copies and variants over the years.
This is a 370-point version that was developed in MS-PDS FORTRAN. It starts, as most versions of this game start, "You are standing at the end of a road before which is a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully."
The player then explores the environment, encountering snakes, dwarves, treasure, traps and usually death.
