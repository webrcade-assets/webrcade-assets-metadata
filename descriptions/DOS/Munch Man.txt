Munch Man is a Pac-Man variant for one or two players, featuring a few unusual twists. The basic gameplay formula is the same as in Pac-Man : the player controls a yellow round character who eats dots in a maze while being chased by ghosts. However, here the screen only shows a small part of the maze at any given time, with the entire maze only represented by a tiny minimap in the bottom right corner. The other unusual feature is a two-player mode where the second player controls a ghost. Additionally, the game has a "Haunt mode" where ghost sometimes become nearly invisible and thus harder to avoid.
Munch Man was originally sold as shareware, but in 2003 the developer made the full version freely available from their website.
