This program helps its user to learn American Sign Language.  Using vector graphics, it allows the player to look up the signs for various letters and words; it can even read a text file on screen in ASL at variable speeds.  Once the user has studied sufficiently, the program offers a quiz mode where it displays signs and requires the user to type in what they mean.  The program is quite configurable, even allowing the user to specify whether the signs displayed on screen should be right- or left-handed.
