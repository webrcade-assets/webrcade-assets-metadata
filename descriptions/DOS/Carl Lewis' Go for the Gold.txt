Carl Lewis' Go for the Gold is an action game allowing you to play as an athlete training for the Olympic decathlon. The player may practice first before entering competition, starting in high school, then college, national, and eventually world track meets. A full set of rules for each track and field event (100m sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m sprint, 110 metres hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, 1500m run) is included, as well as contemporary USA and world records, and Carl Lewis' short biography. The final challenge is to go against Carl Lewis himself (who provides comments and tips to the player throughout the game).
