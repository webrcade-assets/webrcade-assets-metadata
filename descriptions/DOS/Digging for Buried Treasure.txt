Digging for Buried Treasure is a single player, mouse controlled game in which the player has to discover treasure, uncover it and then identify it.The game area is divided into four windows;* Top Window: This is yellow and runs the whole length of the screen and it contains a short piece of text describing the tool or function that the mouse is hovering overBottom Window: This is blue and like the top window it runs right across the screen presenting random clues about the piece of treasure being soughtRight Window: This contains the treasure hunting tools which range from a brush to TNT and six functions General Help; Treasure Map; Revel & Guess; Play Again; Toggle Sound On/Off and LibraryLeft/Main Window: This shows a picture, sometimes a photograph sometimes a painting. These images are not searched for clues, rather the player uses the tools to remove parts of the image to reveal what is beneath rather like a scratch card.The player uses the tools to attack the main image hopefully finding the treasure beneath, the brush being the most delicate removing just the tiniest amount while the TNT removes a decent square. Once the image is wholly or partly revealed, though in practice this is not necessary, the player moves on to the 'Revel & Guess' function where they are shown the complete item and then asked to select it from a line-up of three pictures.
