Driving cross country brings the natural urges of food and gasoline. Turning off the highway and into the sleepy little town of Dead Rock, you  unwittingly drive right into a hellish nightmare.
Trapped in Dead Rock with no obvious escape route, this text adventure game puts you at odds with the minions of hell itself. While exploring the town and the surrounding area you'll be challenged with puzzles, hellish creatures and interesting people of every kind. Some folks in town will need your help, others will offer to help while some will try and stop you.
With nearly 250 rooms to explore running the range from shops in town to coal mines to a very strange place very far from Dead Rock, adventurers will have hours of fun tackling the challenges as they unravel the dark secrets behind the malevolent force trying to take over.  There's only one way out of Dead Rock but several different ways to get there.
