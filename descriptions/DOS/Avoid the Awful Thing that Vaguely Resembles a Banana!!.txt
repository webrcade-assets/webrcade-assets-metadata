In this text-mode game the player controls a spidery-looking thing, which prowls the random, wrap-around playfield trying to dodge the titular ASCII monstrosity.  The screen is littered with Small Red Things that Passably Resemble Flowers, all of which must be collected in order to proceed to the next round; some of them will have a "power pill" effect (temporarily allowing the player to devour the enemy for points).  Later stages introduce additional foes that get faster and meaner as the game goes on, including a Brown Object that Looks Somewhat Like a Hamburger.  Needless to say, any run-ins with these evil edibles will result in a most ghastly demise.
