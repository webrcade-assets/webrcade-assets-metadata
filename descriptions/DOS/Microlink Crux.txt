Microlink Crux is a two player game which can be played as a single player game against the machine. The game gets its name from the crosses the players have to place on the board. These crosses are composed of four coloured bars, they may all be different colours or two, three or even all four may be the same colour. The object of the game is to place crosses onto the 7x7 game area such that all touching bars are of the same colour. The more difficult the match the higher the point score for placing that piece.
The game is played over three rounds with each player taking turns in attempting to complete the grid. The rounds get progressively harder with just three colours being used in round one, four colours in round two and five in the final round. Scores are given at the end of each round but it is the final cumulative score that wins the game.
The game is keyboard controlled, it keeps a record of the player's wins and losses and it has a screensaver mode if left inactive for too long.
