No Future is a fun little edutainment title developed by EGO Software and commissioned by the Federal Environmental Agency of Germany.
Take the role of a time traveler / city developer taken back in time to the 1900's to a pristine island called FUTURE.
The local populace though living in this paradise suffer from poor nutrition, low life expectancy, no industry, no town and a non-existent economy. As the traveler from the modern world it is up to you to develop the islands potential over the next 100 years.
Build up industry, farming, energy, transportation and waste, all whilst keeping an eye on the various environmental conditions of your island (e.g. Soil Quality), be sure to not destroy the environment whilst building up the island
