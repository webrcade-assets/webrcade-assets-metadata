Tetcolor is a single player, keyboard controlled Tetris -style game.
Although the game looks and plays like Tetris with the same kind of falling block shapes, it is not a Tetris game. In Tetris whole rows are removed when completed, here cells are removed when three or more cells of the same colour are aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
The game plays on a single screen. It is controlled by the numeric keypad, 4 & 6 move the blocks left and right while 5 & 8 rotate them. There seems to be no key that alters the order of the coloured cells within the falling blocks nor is there a key that hastens their descent. The game has basic sound effects and a pre-populated high score table.
