Veritech: Variable Fighter Simulator is a flight simulator based on the Veritech/Valkyrie fighter featured in the Robotech/Macross anime series. In this game, you are able to fly a Veritech fighter, but you are restricted to the Fighter and Guardian/Gerwalk modes, the giant robot Battloid mode being unavailable to play. The initial release (version 1.4) contained four missions, the first mission being a training mission. The flight simulator portions of the game were built using Flight Sim Toolkit.
