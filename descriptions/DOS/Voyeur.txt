Voyeur is a single player, adult, text-based adventure.In this game the player is standing outside Kim's house looking in through the window, Kim is seventeen and her parents are out. The player is armed with a thought transference device which allows them to suggest a series of basic actions to Kim - Look At; Walk To; Change Room; Open; Get; Use; and Quit. These are combined with items in a small inventory which largely consists of furniture but other items appear in the list as they are discovered in cupboards etc. Keys need to be found and then used to unlock drawers and chests.There are four rooms in the house to explore, the kitchen where the game begins, the bedroom, the bathroom and the dining room. By taking Kim into different rooms and suggesting actions her libido will increase to the point where she gradually loses her inhibitions which is when the adult content can be explored. The game's objectives are to nudge Kim into a state of arousal which will lead to 'kinky' solo sex, the more sex the higher the score - a top score of 690 is possible.The game has a 180 minute timer in which it must be completed, in addition if there is a prolonged period of inactivity the game will 'Quit To BBS'.
