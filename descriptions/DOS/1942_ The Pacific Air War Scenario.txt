The add-on scenario disk to 1942: The Pacific Air War offers a multitude of new features. Players can now join the American or Japanese Armies in addition to the Navies. Thus six new land-based planes are available: the P-38 Lightning, the P-40 Warhawk and the P-51 Mustang for the Americans, and the Ki-61 "Tony", the Ki-84 "Frank" and the N1K "George" for the Japanese. Also added are new missions in the Philippines and New Guinea campaigns.
Finally, a modem play option is added, allowing for two players to fly cooperatively or go head-to head in more than 200 missions especially designed for multiplayer.
