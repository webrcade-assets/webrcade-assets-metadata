Thunder, the school bully, has gotten you detention. This obviously requires revenge, so you craft the perfect spitball. But Thunder has crafted the perfect snotball, and has it out for you.
Spitball is a maze game where you control a bouncing ball. While you can point the ball in a specific direction, (as well as speed up and slow down your ball) as soon as it hits a wall, it will bounce off. Your goal in each level is to reach the exit, but standing in your way are a lot of walls, a bounce limit, and an enemy ball. If you run out of bounces or the enemy ball touches you, you will lose a life and have to restart the level.
This was distributed under the Shareware model. (Incorrectly called Freeware in the game.) The free version comes with 15 levels. Registering would get five extra levels, plus a level builder.
