Quatris is broadly similar to Tetris or the like, as the goal is to fill rows using pieces that fall from the top of the playfield. Complete enough rows, and move on to the next level. Levels may differ in their size, in falling speed, in the number of rows required, and in the number of rows of garbage blocks that the level starts with. This game also has bombs and super bombs. Bombs destroy the lowest row of blocks on the field. Super bombs clear the entire field (after a few seconds). Also, while the game usually just features the classic Tetris-style tetrominoes, there is a chance that an oddly-shaped piece shows up.Finally, if the sum of the blocks in the row adds up to the "Quatris Number", you get three bombs, one super bomb, and bonus points.This game was distributed as Shareware; only the first three levels are playable in the unregistered version. The full version has 15 levels, plus more gameplay after all 15 levels have been completed.
