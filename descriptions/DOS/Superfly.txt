The objective of this game is to kill all flies. This is done with a fly swatter, controlled with the mouse cursor. Each time the fly swatter is next to a fly, the fly is killed and becomes a dead, indestructable object. The fly swatter can not move through a dead fly; neither can living flies. Each level has preset walls and bonuses. A bonus can mean that instead of a fly swatter, the user controls a spray so that dead flies disappear instead of becoming indestructable objects.
