Necrons is a tactical war game with RPG elements set in an Eastern medieval kingdom of a low-fantasy world. The war is represented on a zoomed-out map, and units are ordered around to engage into attacks on enemies or conquer castles. Encounters are large scale battles and take place on a separate, more detailed screen, where the player commands regiments of soldiers. Different terrain types and slants factor into the strategy.
