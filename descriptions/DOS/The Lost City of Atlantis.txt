The Lost City of Atlantis is a side-scrolling, 2D action platform game which, unusually, starts with a naked male protagonist.
The story behind the game features Raghim, a Phoenician merchant who wants to travel and be successful but didn't really know how to go about it. Then, one day in a Greek market, a lizard gave him a map into Atlantis and set him on his travels. He starts the game naked and defenceless. His task in each level is to collect seven crystals and give them to the wizard lizard who will then let him leave the level. Of course there are monsters to avoid/overcome so Raghim must collect pearls which can be traded for weapons and should he get hurt there are 'life jars' and food to be collected.
This is a shareware game with two levels of difficulty that comes in three parts:* Episode One is set in ancient Greece and was released as a shareware game.

Episode Two is set in ancient Egypt where Raghim fights deadly insects.
Episode Three is set in Atlantis, here Raghim finds the kings have turned all people and creatures into deadly robots.
