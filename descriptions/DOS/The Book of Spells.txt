The Book of Spells is a point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Tommy, who is approached by the High Priest in his bedroom. Tommy learns of a tale about Evil Warriors that came to capture his land of Geravania 10,000 years ago. Although they fought hard, alongside their wizard, Gerle, ten pages of their Book of Spells were lost to them. The Evil Warriors threatened to return in 10,000 years time and that is where you come in. The High Priest informs you that you will be known as Aarh on this adventure and that it will be your job to retrieve the missing pages. This game is the first chapter on your journey to restore the Book of Spells.
