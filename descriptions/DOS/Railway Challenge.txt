Railway Challenge is a strategy game in which the goal is to build a rail connection between two cities - and faster than the two AI opponents. However, building the railroad itself is the smaller part of the challenge because the player also has to supply the infrastructure needed for the job, e.g energy supply, material transportation and the locos. This is handled by contracting enterprises which deal with those aspects. The game itself is completely menu-based with sub-screens for each single company; the whole scenario is shown as overhead map with abstract symbols. The game features three different locomotives (electro, steam and diesel) which slightly change the requirements and 15 scenarios.
