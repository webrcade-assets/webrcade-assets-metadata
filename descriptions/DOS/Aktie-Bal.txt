Aktie-Bal is a shareware puzzle game consisting of three episodes, each containing 25 levels. The second and third episodes are provided after purchasing the full version.In this game, players control a ball that must collect all the flags and reach the end within a specified time limit. Each level features various elements that either aid or hinder the ballâ€™s progress. These include deadly obstacles like fire, collectible bombs (used to vaporize specific walls), and elevators. The elevators are essential because the ball is able to fall off ledges but lacks the ability to jump. Pressing a button moves the ball one tile, and if the button is pressed multiple times, the game executes all commands without the possibility to stop it.
