Total Knockout: Championship Female Boxing! is a boxing game featuring an international all-female cast, presented as high-resolution pre-rendered sprites. The player's character is viewed from behind, with only a transparent green outline visible, similar to Toughman Contest or Super Punch-Out!!. Each match comprises two or three two-minute rounds, and is won by either knocking out the opponent or having more stamina left when the time runs out. In addition to left and right punches and blocks, every of the ten available fighters has her own special moves. Matches can be played against AI opponents with adjustable difficulty levels, or with other users over network.
