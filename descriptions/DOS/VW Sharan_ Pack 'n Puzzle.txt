VW Sharan: Pack 'n Puzzle is an advergame made to promote the first generation of the Volkswagen Sharan. The goal is to put stuff (people, animals, objects) into the van and arrange it so everything fits in. Some things need to be combined in order to take lesser space in the car, for example you can put a small child in a baby carriage. There are five levels in all. The idea behind it is to show how many space a Sharan has to offer.
