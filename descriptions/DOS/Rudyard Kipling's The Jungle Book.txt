Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book is a point-and-click adaptation of the classical story The Jungle Book. This animated story book adventure features the Paintbox Pals - Sally, Jazz, Winston, and Nick - as it is a part of the Story Painting Adventure series which also includes the games Around the World in 80 Days and Peter Pan.
The player is presented with several situations and problems created by the story's antagonists or the environment. Help is always available thanks to the Paintbox Pals, the player's friends who watch over the story. The player can interact with the story's scenes via the Pals, which are four different animated artistic tools: a paint brush, a pencil, an eraser, and a paint sprayer. This results in solutions to the problems and features humorous dialogues and animations.
The Paintbox also features an hourglass character which is used for rewinding time, and a book character which is used for tasks such as loading, saving et cetera.
The educational aspect of the game is about improving the player's reading skills, broadening vocabulary, and encouraging decision-making and artistic expression. For example, the pencil can be used to draw things in a connect-the-dots style, or the paintbrush can be used to color objects to be different colors depending on the situation.
The player can experience the game many times in many ways - each pass is different depending on the player's choices of what to use when an obstacle occurs in the story. While the majority of the story remains the same during each pass, every one of the Pals provides different solutions at various times and only some of the Pals present a solution for a given situation.
