Cosmic Ambush is a Space Invaders like game for one or two players. It uses pre-rendered graphics for most game objects and level backgrounds. The objective is to shoot down advancing alien aircraft, which, in addition to the classic square formation, may attack in waves or swarm around the player. Accordingly, the player's ship does not only move horizontally, but in all directions, although you always fire towards the top of the screen (some projectiles may travel diagonally).There are several types of aliens, each yielding a different score when shot down. Enemies may drop various powerups, including an extra life, shield and weapon upgrades. The player also has a limited supply of smart bombs that can instantly clear the screen of all aliens at once when activated.The player's craft can withstand more than one hit from enemy fire or collisions with alien ships, but the shields slowly wear down. Although ammo is unlimited, constantly firing the main weapon will make it overheat and stop operating.In the two-player mode, players take turns at beating the game. Once player one loses a life, it's the second player's turn to start the game. If player two is shot down, player one continues from where they left off etc.The game was developed and released as freeware. There are 31 levels.
