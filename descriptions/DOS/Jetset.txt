Jetset is a text mode 747 flight simulator, possibly the very first made for PC. Its code, in BASIC, was published on November 1982's issue of the BYTE magazine.Except during take off / landing, where the runway is visible, all you can see are the plane's panels and controls, which you can operate using the keyboard. Despite its minimal interface, Jetset is realistic as it relies on a good physics engine.
