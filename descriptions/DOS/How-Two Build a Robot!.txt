How-Two Build A Robot! is a single player, shareware, platform game in which the player must collect all the parts needed to build a robot and take them to the laboratory where they are assembled. Naturally there are obstacles to overcome, in this case there are gates, lifts and barriers to navigate around, switches to switch, a stock control robot that takes components to its stock room, and the whole game must be completed before the supply of battery power runs out.The game is entirely keyboard-controlled and has basic sound effects such as bleeps and whistles.
