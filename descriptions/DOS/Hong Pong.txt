Hong Pong is a Pong variant set in five different war zones (including one hidden) and with tanks instead of paddles. Played with two tanks, one on each side of the screen, players need to prevent a spinning nuke from touching their side of the screen, while shooting missiles at the opponent or forcing the nuke to hit his side. In the middle of the screen different kinds of vehicles pass and these hurt the player when touched. It is also possible to activate a shield to block the incoming missiles, but while it is up firing is disabled.The game can be played by two players simultaneously on a single screen with a single keyboard. There are four vehicles to choose from, three difficulty levels, a practice mode, and an rendered opening and ending cutscene sequence.
