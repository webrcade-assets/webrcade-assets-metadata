IBM's adaptation of the perennial board game known as Othello/Reversi, in which two players exchange turns placing chips on the game board, attempting to enclose consecutive chains of the opponent's pieces between two chips of their own. A straight or diagonal line of chips thus trapped will switch sides to the capturing player's color; when all possible moves are exhausted, the player with the most pieces on board wins. Verso may be played against a fellow human contender or versus the CPU.
Traditionally, the opening layout places four chips (two for each player) at the center of the board. This is the default, but this particular rendition of the game includes a board editor, which lets you modify the initial arrangement of chips by changing their numbers and positions. If the game has you stumped, you can request a display of all available moves (or one recommended move); you can even undo your last move in a pinch.
