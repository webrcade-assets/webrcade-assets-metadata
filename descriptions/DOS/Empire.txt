Empire is similar to the classic game Risk, but with more complexity. As with Risk, the goal is to control all countries on the map, with reinforcements arriving every turn, which can be used to attack neighboring countries. However, instead of a single type of military unit, Empire features seven: army, navy, air, carrier, army base, navy base, and air base. Each has different movement restrictions. (Armies can move to adjacent countries, navies can move across ocean spaces, air can attack any country on the same continent, and bases can't move.) Other abilities include nukes and alliances.Empire was distributed as Shareware. The unregistered version can only have a single human player, and eight computer players. It also lacks most unit types, significant options, and ends as soon as a single player controls a quarter of the map.
