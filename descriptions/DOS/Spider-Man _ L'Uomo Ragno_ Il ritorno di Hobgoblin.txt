Simulmondo's Spider-Man is an Italian series of games that were originally distributed through newsstands, and Il ritorno di Hobgoblin (The Return of Hobgoblin) is the first episode.
The game is mainly a point-and-click adventure game, where you collect and use items, and look for evidence. Some places have their own separate close-up screen, where different icons for actions appear. There's also some side-view action elements, as you have to fight generic thugs to get through some stages.
