Bridge 4.0 is the fourth in a series of bridge simulators for multiple systems.Entirely text-based, Bridge 4.0 allows the player and their computer companion to bid against two computer opponents and then play out the hand. Gameplay consists of rounds of bidding, followed by actual card play. Bridge 4.0 is laid out in columns similar to the newspaper, and the program reviews the bidding, keeps track of the score and tricks taken, and will inform the player of any illegal bids or plays made. At the beginning of each game, the deck is randomized based upon a seed value, allowing the player to replay interesting hands at a future date.
