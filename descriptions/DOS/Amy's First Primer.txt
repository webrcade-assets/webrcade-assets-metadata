Amy's First Primer is a collection six early learning mini-games to teach young users navigation, logic, counting and ABCs. During gameplay the game will not criticise for any mistakes made, allowing for the player to experiment with the keyboard until the right answer is found. For the second, third and fourth activities completed successfully, the player will be treated to the ABC song, while the last two activities remain continuous.
