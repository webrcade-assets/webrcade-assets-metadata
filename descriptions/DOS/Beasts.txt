Beasts is an adventure game with a horror-themed sci-fi story but most of it is only suggested, not shown. The game is a classical adventure game, in color. The view is in the 1st person, so you seen what the character sees, in a frame that takes a quarter of the screen.You can interact with the scene using three different actions: look, use (or pick) and the inventory. You can then get description of items, usable objects or commands of the scene, and get clues to solve the few puzzles of the game. As you can pick objects from the scene, you can use them later elsewhere by using the inventory icon. All controls are mouse driven, the keyboard is not used.At the beginning of the game, you are woken up by a loud scream and will have to figure what's going on in your mansion. Soon, you will face the horror that is set there, and the hideous Beasts that are now in your house.
