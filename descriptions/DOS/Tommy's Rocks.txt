Tommy's Rocks is a DOS shareware game.The player controls a character that can be moved left & right along the bottom of the screen. Rocks fall from the top of the screen. Being hit by a rock ends the game so the player must dodge the rocks in order to survive.One point is scored for each rock that misses the player and hits the ground.There are nine levels of difficulty. The higher levels of difficulty have a greater number of rocks falling from the sky and the level of the ground is raised so the rocks have a shorter distance to fall and the player has correspondingly less time to dodge them.As the rocks fall they build up in piles across the bottom of the screen. In levels 4 and above the player cannot move left / right across the screen if the next heap is more than three blocks higher than their current level.The game records the top ten scores for each level of difficulty.
