Thunder Strike is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up in a futuristic setting. It utilizes parallax scrolling and pre-rendered sprites, somewhat similar to Stargunner. The player controls a flying craft armed with a gun, missiles and bombs, and must survive against waves of hostile airships, flying mines and other hazards. All weapons have limited ammo, but can be resupplied by collecting weapon pickups that float around. Other useful power-ups might be found as well, such as shields.The game has no plot, which was a deliberate choice by the author. The objective of each level is simply to reach the end while scoring as many points as possible by destroying enemies.Thunder Strike was marketed as shareware. The unregistered version contains the first level out of eight in the full game.
