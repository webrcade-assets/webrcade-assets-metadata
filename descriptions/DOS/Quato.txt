Quato is a word game played on a 5 x 5 grid that looks superficially similar to the board game Boggle but in practice does not play the same way. Each tile in the grid has a letter on it, and the player (single player only) attempts to spell as many words as possible within the given time limit of three minutes by sliding the tiles around the grid. Words are automatically recognized from the game's included dictionary of 80,000 words. The player's end score is computed based on the length of the words and the value of the letters used  to compose the words.
