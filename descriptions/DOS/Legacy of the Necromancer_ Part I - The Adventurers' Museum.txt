In Legacy of the Necromancer: Part I - The Adventurers' Museum, the player visits a museum which holds 20 of the most famous treasures of all time. Well, at least it did until the last renovation during which the protective spells had to be disengaged. A wizard took this opportunity and summoned an imp which promptly stole all the treasure! The player's goal is to explore the nearby cave and bring it back.In order to win the game, the player needs to solve puzzles by collecting items (the inventory can hold six) and entering commands into the parser. It supports most commands and abbreviations found in Zork. Like in those classic adventure games, the player can die and render the game unwinnable with certain moves. Resource management (determined by the number of moves) includes thirst, hunger, air (when underwater) and lamp power.This game is the first part of the Legacy of the Necromancer series. Although all three parts were released simultaneously and share the same gameplay mechanics, they could be purchased and played individually.
