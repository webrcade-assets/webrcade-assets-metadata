XInvaders 3D is a fixed-screen arcade shooting game with 3D wireframe graphics, heavily inspired by Galaga and Space Invaders. The player's ship is viewed from behind, while the alien armada is advancing towards the screen in the familiar rectangular formation, trying to shoot the player down. The objective is to destroy all aliens before they collide with the player while avoiding their projectiles. Occasionally, a flying saucer appears in the background and flies across the screen, and shooting it down earns the player extra points.The game was originally written for the X Window System (X11) to be run on Unix-like platforms, hence the name. It was eventually ported to DOS and Windows as well. XInvaders 3D is freeware and its source code is available under the GNU GPL license.
