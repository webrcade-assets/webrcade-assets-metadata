Madman is an RPG by solo developer Dr. Dungeon of Ultizurk fame. It uses the same enhanced Ultizurk III engine as Wraith (and, like Wraith, is a standalone game with its own self-contained story).
The player assumes the role of a character who lands his ship on a strange island. Some mad wizard cast a spell of forgetfulness upon the inhabitants, and it is up to the player to find out what's going on.
Gameplay is similar to Dr. Dungeon's previous game, Wraith. It has a mouse-driven interface and highly interactive environments akin to Ultima VII. Any object in the gameworld can be picked up or used. Conversations involve picking questions from a list, which NPCs will then reply to. Combat is a simple real-time affair of walking next to an enemy and clicking on it until it's dead. The game features custom character creation where the player can choose the sex and class of his character. Available classes are fighter, druid, ranger, and paladin.
The game was remade in 2017 as Dr. Dungeon's Madman!.
