Requiem For A Heavyweight is a single player boxing game.
This is an unusual boxing game in that there are no pictures of boxers, no keyboard button-mashing tactics to throw a punch, no actual violence at all.
The player selects two boxers from a list of all-time greats and sets the number of rounds they will fight over. For each round they then select a boxing style for each boxer and the game does the rest, simulating the fight blow-by-blow. 
At the end of each round, the boxing style of each boxer can be adjusted so, for example, a boxer who's behind on points can go for the big finish.
At the end of the last round, the judges rule on the winner.
The game is entirely keyboard-controlled and it keeps rankings for each boxer.
