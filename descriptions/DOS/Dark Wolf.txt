Dark Wolf is a single player, shareware, keyboard controlled platform game.
The story behind the game is told in the first dozen or so screens, one phrase at a time. The opening text reads Where the twin rivers meet at the edge of the known world Terinar is at the brink of war. The Silver Moon & White Fire are in conflict. The king and his inner circle, seem to be the only ones capable of stopping the inevitable war. At the king's palace ..."
At this point the player is summoned to meet the king who, in a similar style, sends the player to the Silver Moon at Rysada as a diplomat so, after selecting one of the three difficulty settings, off you go.
The game is a 2D, side scrolling platform game in which the arrow keys control movement and A/S/X/Z select and use items and spells.
It is very easy to die in this game and, unless the game has been saved, it really is Game Over!
