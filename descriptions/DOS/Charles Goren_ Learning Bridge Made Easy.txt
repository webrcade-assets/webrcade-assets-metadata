Charles Goren: Learning Bridge Made Easy is a bridge teaching tool for the Apple II.
Based upon works by famed bridge columnist Charles Goren, this game endeavors to teach the player improved bridge playing technique. The software helps the player with hand evaluation, bidding, and direct competitive. Gameplay consists of a number of quizzes, where the player must answer questions on point value, or what they think is the most appropriate next play. Finally, there are 100 pre-built hands, where the player must play through the whole hand, answering which moves they believe are most appropriate, and being prompted if they choose incorrectly.
