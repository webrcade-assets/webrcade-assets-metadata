Future Conflict is a real-time strategy game that is an almost verbatim replica of Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer. The way units are controlled and base structures are managed is identical to Command & Conquer, and even the resource mineral, Argolite, will slowly damage any infantry unit which walks over it. The selection of units is also very similar to Westwood RTS games: there are riflemen, grenadiers and missile soldiers, jeeps and tanks, artillery units and even helicopters.
The game has a single-player campaign that spans 11 missions in which the player controls government forces (orange) against unspecified rebels (green). Also included is a two-player multiplayer mode over IPX, and the skirmish mode against up to four AI players, with a small selection of skirmish maps available. It is also possible to play user-made maps and scenarios.
Future Conflict was created by Chris Jones (author of the Adventure Creator / Adventure Game Studio) and distributed as shareware. While registration was not mandatory and the free shareware version is not limited in any way, registered users would receive a map editor, mission creator and the ability to create their own units.
