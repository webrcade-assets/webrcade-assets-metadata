Lucullus is a Hebrew adaptation of the classic board game Risk, renamed after a Roman general who, according to legend (or so the game claims), had invented a similar game in ancient times. 2 to 6 players may compete for world domination; in a two-player game, a third participant is represented by the computer, which controls a weaker, neutral army only capable of defense.
The familiar objective remains the same: destroy the opposing armies and conquer the world. First, the 42 territory cards are divided between the warring parties, who must distribute their armies among them. Each game turn begins with reinforcements, where additional armies are allocated; then comes the battle stage, with the results determined by a dice roll. Finally, the current player is allowed one transfer of forces between adjacent areas. Cards are awarded for conquered territories - a series of cards (three with the same symbol) can be traded in for reinforcements.
