An educational title which appropriately delves deeply into the subject of volcanoes: their formation and classification, the geological and physical aspects of volcanic activity, and its impact on people and the environment.  The information is delivered in the form of animated slideshows divided into chapters, each peppered with a series of thought/review questions to stimulate the learning process.  Two more interactive challenges test you on your knowledge - a true-or-false quiz which presents 10 questions on the subject matter, and a matching quiz where you must pair corresponding terms from two columns of data; both provide feedback and score based on your performance.
