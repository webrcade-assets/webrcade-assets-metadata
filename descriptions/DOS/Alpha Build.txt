Alpha Build is an educational game that teaches alphabet skills to children. The player controls a penguin called Perry who has to climb ladders to pick up letters and then drop them onto the correct truck. The aim of the game is to build a city and to do so three sets of trucks have to be loaded with letters. Each stage involves loading eight trucks which will then drive away and construct the city. First the frame is built, then the surface and finally it is coloured.
There are eight levels of play. The first four levels involve simple letter recognition, upper and lower case matching and alphabetical order. Level 5 adds words to the game while level 6 to 8 are word challenges in which some of the needed letters are hidden.
