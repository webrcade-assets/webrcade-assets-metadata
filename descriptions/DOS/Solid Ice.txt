Solid Ice is an ice hockey game. It carries the NHLPA license and thereby features real NHL players but not the NHL license which means all teams are made up although they resemble the real teams in some ways. The game has a built-in editor which can be used to modify both teams and players. This includes names and statistics but also the teams' logos and uniforms.
The game features single exhibition games and a tournament mode which despite the name is a league where teams play each other a selectable number of times. The league can include any number of teams and in each match the player can choose to control either of the teams. There is also an option to auto play matches. The game uses two dimensional sprite graphics that are viewed from an angled side view perspective. Matches can be played against an AI or against another human player. Joysticks, mouse and keyboard can be used to play the game.
Options include disabling certain rules (two line passes, icings and offsides), fatigue and auto line changes as well as the length of periods (from three to twenty minutes). It's also possible to choose a referee profile: blind, normal or strict.
