Devyat' princev Ambera is an adventure game based on Nine Princes in Amber (1970), the first novel from the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny. It follows the adventures of Carl Corey, who wakes up in a hospital with amnesia, escapes and starts searching for answers. After a while he discovers his true identity, his mission and a fantasy world hidden from the eyes of mere mortals. A lot of work has to be done.
The gameplay is linear and consists of several loosely connected elements: a simple point-n-click adventure, a number of quick-time events and 9 stand-alone puzzles. The story is told through dialogs that follow the text of the novel closely. The game comes with 2D hand-drawn characters and pre-rendered backgrounds.
