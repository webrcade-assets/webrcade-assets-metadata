Battle Tank: Barbarossa to Stalingrad is a computer wargame for multiple systems, covering the events of Axis invasion of the Soviet Union from June 1941 to May 1943.
Players can control the Axis and/or the Soviet sides, or the computer can take on one or both roles. The game is text-only, and originally came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of their and the enemy's units. There are a total of seven scenarios to choose from, and the player can also create custom scenarios.  The player takes on the role of scenario commander, and issues orders to different units.  Groupings may or may not follow commands, and messages and reporting may become skewed to represent fog of war.
The player receives a limited weather report each turn, and game play progresses in 1-hour segments.  Each turn units can report in to give their current condition.  Every hour, the player can either request a general report or give orders to groupings.  General report provides the current location of each company, and their current level of engagement.  Individual groupings can be ordered to report, move, advance, attack, retreat, screen, hold, or special orders.
