Moraff's Monster Memory is an updated version of Moraff's Memory. It is a one or two player game based on the card game Concentration.
In the single player game the object is to match all pairs of cards in the fewest possible turns.
In the two player game players take turns selecting pairs of cards, if they select a matching pair they score points and get another turn. The player with the most points wins.
The game is played on an 8x6 grid where every cell is identified by a upper or lower case letter. All the pictures are child friendly monsters. It has no high score table or sound and is played entirely with the mouse.
