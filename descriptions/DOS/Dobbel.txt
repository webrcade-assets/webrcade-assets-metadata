In Dobbel the player has five dice and a playing card with the numbers from 5 to 30 on it. The objective of the game is to mark all the numbers on the playing card. This is done by throwing the dice and adding the values on the faces of the dice. For example, when the player throws 1 , 5,  3,  4 and 5 and marks 18 on their playing card if it's not marked yet. Each round the player throws the dice five times. After each throw the player can decide to hold some dice and only throw the remaining dice. When all five dice show the same value, a random number is marked on the playing card.
