Fury: The Nightmare Begins! is a top-down action game similar to Berzerk. The player must navigate through a maze of single rooms, each screen starts with several enemy robots, avoid their shots and return fire, kill the robots to clear a path to one of the exits to advance to the next screen.Each room consists of is a 4x5 grid of walls, pink walls can be shot by both the player and the robots. Shoot a hole in the wall big enough to be able to pass through to other exits. The cyan walls are solid and cannot be destroyed. The robots can also shoot each other, so just avoiding the robots at the start of a level for long enough will sometimes kill off most of them.The game uses digitized voice samples, in what the game refers to as BigGuyVoice. At the start of each game a digitized voice says "First you will die, and then you will lose the game!", and after losing your last life it says "Your game is over ahaha". Other voice samples include "go after him, you fools" and "the humanoid must not get away" when exiting a room, and "ow ow ouch!" when the player is killed.
