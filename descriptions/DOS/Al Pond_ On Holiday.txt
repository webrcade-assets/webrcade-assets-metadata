Al Pond: On Holiday is a short game which is meant to bridge the gap between Al Pond 2 and the never-released Al Pond 3. After his adventures, Al decides to go on vacation on Pawaii Island. Unfortunately, danger has a way of finding him...In contrast to the second part of the series, Al Pond: On Vacation goes back to using Sierra's AGI engine. The gameplay is unchanged: the player gives commands over the parser and collects items to solve puzzles.
