Aladino is an action game loosely based on the Arabic folk tale “Aladdin.” In the game, the player must solve three levels and defeat a boss to save the girl. The levels are isometric and consist of interconnected rooms, each with up to four exits. To complete a level, the protagonist must locate all hidden magic lamps and deliver them to the djinn, who resides in one of the rooms. Along the way, the player will encounter various enemies that deplete their health bar with each hit. Some enemies must be avoided, while others can be defeated with sword swings. Additionally, each level has a time limit.
