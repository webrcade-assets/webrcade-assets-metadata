Checkers is a single player, shareware implementation of the traditional board game.It is played entirely via the keyboard and has functions for changing the colour of the pieces, the board and for printing out the moves made in the game.Piece selection in this game is unusual, the rows and columns are numbered and the player selects the column of the piece they wish to move. The game then picks the piece in that column that can be moved and repeatedly shows it first in its current position and then in its new position. If this is the move the player wishes to make, they press ENTER to confirm. If it's not, they use the up/down arrows to select either a different destination square or a different piece.This game does not recognise quadruple jumps.
