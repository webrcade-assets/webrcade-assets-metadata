This is another variation on Lunar Lander, where a rocket in free-fall must be guided to a safe landing on the lunar surface. As gravity takes its toll on the landing craft, it can be rotated in four directions in order to apply the desired thrust. Each push of the thrust button costs a unit of fuel - the first lander starts with 60, and each successive lander inherits the previous one's unused fuel, plus an extra 25 units. There's also an emergency thrust control, which applies a good upwards push (at a large cost of gas).If the rocket makes it to a flat surface without incident, the player gets 250 points; a crash into uneven ground (or into another rocket!) will end the game. The top ten scores are recorded and saved.
