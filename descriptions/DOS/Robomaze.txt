Robomaze is a top-down maze exploration and shooter game, and the first in the Robomaze trilogy.The player has to navigate a robot through a maze moving from room to room, collecting bullets and rockets, shooting other robots to survive as well as shooting walls to pass through parts of the maze. There are 3 weapons, which are standard bullets, rockets and a laser. Each weapon requires their own ammunition, additional ammunition will be dropped by enemies when they die or sometimes hidden inside walls. The rooms have all sorts of different walls, blue walls ricochet the bullets, some walls require rockets to be shot. Some rooms have two teleport chambers, enter one to emerge from the other, this can be used to get past unbreakable walls. All enemies as well as the damage to walls is reset every time the player re-enters a room. Presumably the ultimate goal is to find an exit to the maze.The game features tank-like controls, meaning press left and right (J and L keys) to rotate, and press I to activate the engine or K to stop the engine, i.e. move forward or stand still. Press space to shoot and press return key to switch to the next weapon. Each time the player is hit a life is lost, lose all lives and it's game over, however there are effectively infinite continues. Continuing the game will reset and respawn all enemies, but the passages the player has shot through the wall as well as the player position are not reset.
