In this educational trading simulator the player takes on the role of a maritime merchant in the Eastern Mediterranean, sailing from port to port and dealing in regional goods.  The objective is to conclude seven days of commerce with the highest possible profit.
Three different ports may be visited (in Israel, Turkey and Egypt), where three types of trade goods are bought and sold - copper, olives and grain; the prices differ in each location, and fluctuate daily.  But riding the volatile market will be the least of your problems: the high seas are rife with dangers - from storms to pirates - and random events may take a toll on your fortune, like navigational errors, burglaries or even dock worker strikes.  You may decide to play it safe, or to brave such risks as rough weather, nightly voyages, and sailing with an overloaded ship.
All these hazards may result in damage to your vessel, which can incur costly repairs. Pirate encounters are especially unpredictable, but the odds can be stacked in your favor if you hire some armed escort ships.  Other incidents are somewhat luckier, like the occasional bargain at a harbor or coming across a derelict vessel.  Your hard-earned cash can be put in the bank for safekeeping, or kept on hand for contingencies; whatever your profits, all stored goods must be sold at the end of the week, as the score is calculated based on your total earnings.
