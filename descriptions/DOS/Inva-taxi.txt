Pentti-Antero Sillanköykäys has been severely disabled for his whole life. After his 27th birthday he starts seeing prophetic dreams which help him to miraculously cure himself. He feels an urge to contribute something back to the society and starts a taxi service for the disabled; the Inva-taxi.
Even though Inva-taxi was originally meant to be a simple joke, it was one of those games that spread in Finnish BBS systems. The gameplay is based on a unique feature: speech recognition by the player. The player listens to the incomprehensible mongling of instructions given by disabled people and tries to select the right destination for the taxi ride. There really isn't any more content in the game than listening to the samples and clicking the right spot on the map.
