Rolling Jack is a Boulder Dash clone. On each level, the protagonist (a smiling, red ball), who can move freely in 4 directions, must collect all the coins and then go into the exit.
There are numerous dangers in the levels: rocks which fall when there is free space beneath them, and which can kill our hero by falling on him, or block his progress and make him unable to complete the level; flying screws and chattering teeth, which fly along walls and kill the hero if they collide with him (the chattering teeth must be killed, e.g. by dropping rocks on them, as each such a monster contains 9 necessary coins); grenades that explode when they fall or when something falls on them; rotating spheres that push the hero in a particular direction; one-way passages; and pushable blocks that must be pushed intelligently.
The hero can find bombs that he can set up at any point; they then explode after a while, destroying any neighboring objects (apart from certain, indestructible walls).
The game features a level editor which allows for the creation of up to 120 custom levels.
