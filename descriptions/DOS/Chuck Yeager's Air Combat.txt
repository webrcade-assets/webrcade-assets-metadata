Chuck Yeager's Air Combat is a flight combat simulation. Fight over 50 missions with Chuck Yeager's advice on your side. You can use the mission builder to create your own missions if the history-based missions don't offer enough challenge. Replay modes let you fast forward and rewind through a recorded battle, including a 3-D "cube" visualization that helps analyze what happened.
