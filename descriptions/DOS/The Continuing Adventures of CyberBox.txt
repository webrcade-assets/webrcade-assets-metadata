The Continuing Adventures of CyberBox is an unofficial sequel to the block-pushing puzzle game CyberBox by a different author. Unlike Cyberbox II, which is the direct sequel made by CyberBox ' creator, The Continuing Adventures of CyberBox takes a more conservative approach to the original playing mechanics, although new elements are introduced as well, and adds more puzzles by various authors, including the original CyberBox levels by Doug Beeferman. The main difference is that each level/room is still confined to one screen, while Cyberbox II introduced much larger levels.
As in CyberBox, the objective of each level is to guide the player character to the room's exit through a maze, blocked by various boxes that can be moved according to different rules: some may only be pushed vertically, some only horizontally, and some move only when they are pushed by an adjacent box and not by the player. Unlike Soko-Ban, The Continuing Adventures introduces boxes that can be pulled but not pushed, again, only in certain directions depending on which sides have "handles" for the player to hold on to. Similar to the original CyberBox games, boxes can be pushed in stacks.
The Continuing Adventures of CyberBox was first marketed as shareware: the basic game was free to download and distribute, but users could order the Deluxe Version with even more rooms and the ability to load and play custom levels. Even though the free basic game included the level (room) editor, users could only create and playtest their own levels, but not load the creations of others. In 2011, author Edward D. Collins made the Deluxe Version free to download as well.
