The story takes place in a fantasy world. In a barren region called Farhun, there is a fertile group of island called Sodar. The dragons of the east try to conquer Sodar which results in a cruel war between them and the humans inhabiting Sodar. While the humans can kill all dragons but one, the remaining dragon - Fasthar, the Devilish Wyrm, defeats the the humans and establishes a cruel reign over Sodar. He names one of the islands after himself and builds his residence, a tower, at the highest place of the island. Fasthar demands human sacrifices every solstice and threatens to kill everyone coming even remotely close to his tower. However, a brave knight finally sets out to defeat Fastharn once and for all.
The Last Knight is a platform game. Its presentation is somewhat reminiscent of Capcom's Ghouls 'N Ghosts, but it plays differently. Your main attack is jumping on an enemy's head. You can find weapons like daggers, but they can only be used a limited number of times. Items are placed in chests. To unlock a chest, you must find a corresponding key. There three kinds of keys (gold, silver and bronze).
