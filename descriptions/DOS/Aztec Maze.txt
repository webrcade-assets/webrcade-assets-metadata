Aztec Maze is a Pac-Man variant that replaces the protagonist with an archaeologist called Adventure Bob who collects treasure in an Aztec tomb while being chased by evil spirits. Bonus fruit items are replaced by "idols". The game offers no other deviations from the classic Pac-Man formula, with a similar maze layout and powerups that temporarily render the ghosts helpless.
Aztec Maze was sold as shareware, with just two out of ten levels in the unregistered version. The game was created with the DIV Games Studio suite, and appears to be directly based on the template of a sample Pac-Man clone that was included with it.
