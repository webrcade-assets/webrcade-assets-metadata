This is an adaptation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard, itself an expansion of the folk game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The revision was created by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla and later featured in multiple episodes of The Big Bang Theory under the revised moniker Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The modified version was first used to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between Sheldon and Raj in 'The Lizard-Spock Expansion.' It was mentioned again in 'The Rothman Disintegration,' where Sheldon explains the rules to Penny and Barry Kripke.Instead of the usual three choices, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock adds the additional options of "Lizard" and "Spock." Lizard beats Spock and Paper, while Spock defeats Rock and Scissors. Lizard can be defeated by Rock and Scissors, while Spock can be defeated by Paper and Lizard.
