Mad News is a German business simulation. You are chief editor of a tabloid newspaper. With spectacular stories you try to increase your paper's circulation (and your account balance). You also can earn money with adverts in your paper. Two other papers are in competition with you.
This is the unofficial sequel to Mad TV.
