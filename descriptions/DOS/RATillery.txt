An artillery game inspired by Gorillas, only with warring rats instead of antagonistic apes (and even lower system requirements). The rival rodents are having a bit of a territorial dispute over a warehouse full of savory restaurant supplies, and are determined to solve it by the time-tested means of lobbing fiery death at each other.Either player may be human or computer-controlled (two computer opponents can challenge each other, too) and the number of rounds can be configured per game. A shot is taken by entering an angle and a velocity, and watching the projectile fly; if one of the vermin is hit, the other scores and another round begins - with a new random arrangement of crates. The usual artillery formula is extended with some additions: adjustable air resistance, an optional suspended crate which absorbs unlucky shots, and the option to hide your typed input values from the other player.
