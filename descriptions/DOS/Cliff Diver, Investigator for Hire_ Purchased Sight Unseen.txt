Purchased Sight Unseen is the second game featuring P.I. Cliff Diver.
In this game Cliff attends an auction where he chances on an argument between the Beverly Skapes and the auctioneer. Beverley's sister, Cynthia, was a talented but blind painter - all her creations were from memory. Cynthia was murdered and some of her works are being sold by a Monsieur Valeux against what Beverly claims were Cynthia's wishes. Cliff takes the case looking for evidence of wrongdoing.
