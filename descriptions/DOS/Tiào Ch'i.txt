The strategy board game Chinese Checkers is unrelated to checkers, nor does it originate in China; nevertheless, this particular adaptation draws heavily on Chinese themes. Ti√†o Ch'i translates to "jump chess", and computer AI players are given the names of deities from the ancient Chinese pantheon. Each player controls a contingent of numbered tiles, but in the graphical version these can be replaced with pictorial tokens, representing the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac.
2 to 6 players may participate, with each player attempting to relocate all his tokens to the opposite side of the star-shaped game board. One piece may be moved per turn - either by advancing a single step onto an empty space, or by a series of jumps over other tokens. Human or CPU control may be chosen for each player; all computer opponents have a unified skill level (Novice, Expert or Master) which may be changed in mid-game.
