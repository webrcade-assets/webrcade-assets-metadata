Made by the Israeli company Makh-Shevet, Cruel World is a tribute to the famous game Prince of Persia, having identical gameplay and looking very similarly to the classic platformer.The hero is an innocent citizen who was thrown into a deep dungeon without trial and explanation. The goal is to escape from prison. Just like the prince, the hero must perform a variety of runs and jumps, fight enemies (skeletons and others) in real-time combat, and occasionally solve environmental puzzles.
