Deep in the Xon system lies a source of absolute power, protected by dangerous creatures known as the Octaxon. Weighing the risks, an adventurer named Parsec dons a jetpack suit fitted with a two-level bolt emitter and heads out in search of his prize.Parsec Man 3D is a minimalist action platformer shooter, with a stripped-down design and visual style similar to those of much later indie games like Fred Wood's Love and Daniel Remar's Hero Core. Owing partially to the game's support of red/cyan anaglyphic 3D glasses, its presentation largely consists of simple, distinct shapes in just a few colors: black, white, a medium gray, red, cyan, and various shades of purple.Parsec, the titular hero, is controlled mostly with the numerical keypad, with his main shot mapped to the spacebar and his extra-powerful plasma bolt tied to the "A" key. In levels with gravity, the "7/Home" and "9/PgUp" keys are mapped to lateral jumps. The character has a limited supply of plasma bolts, and must collect more from [P] icons in the environment.The game's overall structure is semi-linear, with a planet select screen at the start and end of each level. The level orientations and compositions vary, from side-scrolling platform action to free-floating shooter segments; from a linear, objective-based design to an open-ended, exploration-heavy structure. Each level is also distinguished by a distinct visual scheme and set of challenges, including collapsing bridges and 3D mazes.Often the design makes constructive use of the game's 3D effect, to offer occasional puzzles which pop into relief when played with the correct glasses, yet for the unequipped player can also be traversed with a bit of trial-and-error.
