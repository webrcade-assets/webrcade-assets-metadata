The demo version of Star Wars: TIE Fighter includes one unique mission which takes place during the Imperial assault on Hoth. The player takes the role of a TIE fighter pilot whose squadron is tasked with the destruction of the Rebel repair yard in the Remitik system in order to prepare an ambush for the retreating Rebel spacecraft that might escape the attacking Imperial fleet on Hoth. This results in rather intense space combat, including a bonus encounter with a powerful A-Wing Rogue enemy. The demo mission was not included in any other release of the game.The TIE Fighter demo, being based on an early pre-release build of the game, shows various differences from the final version, such as a different cockpit design, spacecraft models, sound effects and music, some of which were carried over from Star Wars: X-Wing at that stage of development.
