Jump! is an arcade game of guiding a permanently bouncing ball through a vertically scrolling field of obstacles. The ball always moves in a vertical direction (thus making it look like vertical scroller). Player can freely control the ball's movement in a horizontal direction and affect the speed of vertical movement. Features of the field include holes which make the player lose a ball upon contact, arrows that hasten the ball or reverse vertical movement, black holes that work as teleporters, walls that block ball movement, switches that make some walls disappear, etc.
