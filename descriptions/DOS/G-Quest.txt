G-Quest is a puzzle/adventure game that combines a block-pushing puzzle in the vein of Soko-Ban with a maze exploration game where items are collected for points. The player controls a yellow ball that moves around a mazelike environment which contains gems of different colours, boxes that may be pushed, and various obstacles.
The objective is to collect all gems, move all boxes to special areas, and reach the level exit. Obstacles include coloured "doors" that may be opened or closed upon walking over a floor button of the respective colour, and one-way tiles which will push the player in the direction that the arrow on the floor is pointing. Some items (including certain pushable boxes) are hidden beneath a question mark and are only revealed when the player bumps into it. Unlike the traditional Soko-Ban game, levels take up more than one screen, but a schematic map is displayed at the bottom.
G-Quest was marketed as shareware, with seven levels in the unregistered version, and 50 levels in the "Deluxe" registered game.
