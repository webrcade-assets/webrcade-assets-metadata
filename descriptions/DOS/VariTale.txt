VariTale is an early BBS door implementation of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure hypertext, allowing users to read through and extend up to three stories per installation (15 in the registered version!) via an oldschool command-line interface. Unconventionally, the author of a given chapter is not given the option of dictating which options follow their passage: that choice is given instead to the writers of the future chapters.Comes bundled with two sample adventures, The Secret of the Broken Sword and Space Terror! The latter is more nominal than the former, but both exhibit the vaguely cheeky insouciance that characterises Pinnacle 's humorous writing.
