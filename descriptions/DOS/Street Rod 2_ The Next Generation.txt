The main premise of "Street Rod 2" stayed the same as in the prequel. You buy cars, repair and customise them and finally race with the opponents. Your ultimate goal is to beat the existing king on three courses that if you do you get to regain your long lost crown and take home his girl, again. Time line has changed and the story takes place six years later. It means that there are different vehicles to choose from.The interface is thankfully the same. There are some improvements concerning the way the cars can be maintained. Next to the transmission, tyres and engine with its manifold and carburetors, the player can mingle with differentials and exhaust system (including mufflers). The chassis can also be altered (as in the prequel) but additionally bumpers also can be changed. Unfortunately the stickers can no longer be placed on the car. There are 3 venues to race. Next to well known from the first part drag race and road race (called Mulholland Drive), there is also an aqueduct race with obstacles on the road that the player has to overtake along with being careful not to flip the car over on the sloped aqueduct walls. There is also one more addition - every Wednesday night the player can compete in a drag race competition called "Grudge Night" where the player is required to set a "breakout time" after which the player must defeat all opponents without running faster than their breakout time. There are also more possibilities to car crash that can result from hitting rocks, drains, barriers and bridge supports at any speed or from passing through roadworks at speeds greater than 50 miles per hour. The system of betting money or pink slips stayed intact. Gameplay is pretty much the same however the controls are a bit tighter.
