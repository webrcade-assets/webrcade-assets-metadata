High School Confidential is the sixth of Softside Magazine's Adventures of the Month, published for multiple systems.
Welcome to John Handley High School in Winchester, Virginia. You are about to embark on a journey through high school in which you are seeking your diploma. Before graduating, you must first pass a minimum of 6 subjects. In each class there are 3 activities to complete, and if you do all 3, you will get an A in that class. Doing a single activity correctly will reward the player with a D, which is sufficient to pass a subject. The player must navigate the school to access different classrooms and facilities. The player must take care not to get caught in the hallways without a hall pass, or spend too much time outside of school, or they are at risk of receiving a suspension. At the end of the term, the player receives their report card.
All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and restore feature.
