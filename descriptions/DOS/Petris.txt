Petris is a single player shareware game which plays a bit like Tetris, however unlike Tetris the blocks do not fall automatically - they are steered into position with the arrow keys. This game has four levels of difficulty:Level 1: The easy gameLevel 2: Like level 1 but there is a time limit during which the block must be droppedLevel 3: Here the block cannot be flipped, what you see is what you dropLevel 4: Both prevents a block being flipped and has a time limit during which it must be droppedThe player scores points for each completed row.The game is entirely keyboard-controlled, has sound effects, and uses character graphics.
