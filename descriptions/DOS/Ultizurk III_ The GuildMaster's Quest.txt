Basic interaction with the game world is accomplished by using the mouse, talking to NPCs requires the player to type keywords highlighted in yellow. The game boasts a great degree of interactivity, with the player being able to manipulate most items in a way they would behave in real life (e.g. fill a bucket with water and then put a burning torch out with it).The shareware version of The Guildmaster's Quest is a complete adventure, and upon registration, the user would receive the second part called ULTIZURK III: The Mobius Mind.
