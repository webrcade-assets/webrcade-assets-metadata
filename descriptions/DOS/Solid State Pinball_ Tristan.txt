Solid State Pinball: Tristan is a pinball simulator which features a single medieval-themed board (hence the title) displayed in a single screen with score and bonus indicators filling the rest of the screen. Includes multiplayer hot-seat support in which each player plays a ball and switches when losing and also features the ability to nudge and tilt the machine, besides regular paddle controls.
