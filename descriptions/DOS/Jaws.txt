Jaws is a strategy and arcade game for multiple systems.
Based upon the movie Jaws, the player plays as captain of a fishing ship with the goal of hunting down the elusive shark Jaws. Starting in Bar Harbor, Maine, the player must equip a fishing vessel with crew, fuel, food, weaponry, and ammo. The player can travel to various ports on the east and west coast of North America. While at sea, the player encounters shark swarms. Sharks are hunted from a side view via harpoon gun, rifle, or via scuba diving, and by killing and collecting deceased sharks, the player can sell their remains at the general store for money. The player also receives tasks from the mayor, and can purchase expensive boat upgrades at the harbor shop.
There is a practice mode, where the player can practice the different forms of combat with sharks at a variety of skill levels to hone their shark hunting.
