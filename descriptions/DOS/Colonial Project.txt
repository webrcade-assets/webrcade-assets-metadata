Colonial Project is a real-time military-economical strategy game with a Traditional Chinese interface. In this game you have to go through four missions on various planets. The surface on each planet has its own specific features (desert, forest, rocks and lava). In each of the missions there are two types of tasks are provided. The first type is to reach a certain count of colonists during a limited time. The second type is an obligatory destruction of the headquarter in the colony of enemy side. Your opponent is the very militarized Lowell Empire and battles are fought over the possession of scarce natural resources.
The natural resources in the game are realized as four different types such as uranium, oil, iron and fresh water. In the battles you can manage combat vehicles squads and give the orders personally to each tank crew. You also have the opportunity to build a variety of objects: plants, tank factories, power stations, schools, hospitals, business centers and many other facilities. A good industrial production can lead to surplus production, so warehouses can be built for storage of over-production surpluses. Every two months a commercial spaceship arrives in the colony, so surpluses can be sold.
An important element of the game is developing technology. Each of the technologies has five degrees of perfection. Technologies are grouped into three different classes: mining and manufacturing, construction and science, military vehicles and weapons. With a higher level of technological perfection the various factories and mechanisms are working more effective and faster. Therefore, from the beginning of this game you need to develop the only tool for improving of all technologies - computer hardware. If the economic indicators of your colony are strongly negative, then it will stop colony development during a short time, and gameplay will ingloriously ended.
