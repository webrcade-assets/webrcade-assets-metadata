A child has gone missing and detective Mike Rock has been hired to solve the case. Rock has to travel across the local highways in order to find out what has happened to the child, dodging deadly hitchhikers and avoiding all the usual unfortunate ends.Parts of Detective Mike Rock are a standard King's Quest -style adventure game, but get outside of a building and there are overhead driving sections. The whole game is controlled by the keyboard. Move by pressing a button, stop by pressing it again. Interactions with the world around you are done by typing, which pauses whatever action is going on-screen at that moment.
