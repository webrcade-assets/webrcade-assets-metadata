Bong Bong is a simple arcade platformer, featuring a little bunny rabbit with an unquenchable passion for sugary foodstuffs. Climb ladders, jump over traps and hop across platforms to grab every food item in sight: get them all, and the next level will present an entirely new type of delicacy to quell your appetite. Beware the scorpions, and watch out for mystery jars - most of them will get you a score bonus, but some may contain a snake.
