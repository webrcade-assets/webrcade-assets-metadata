Bullseye is a simple text-based simulation of the perennial pub game of Darts, for up to 20(!) players. The target board is divided into zones of 10, 20, 30 and 40 points, and each player in turn selects a move: fast overarm, controlled overarm, or underarm - the type of throw dictates the probable outcome. Once all throws have been scored, a new round begins, until one or more players win by reaching 200 points.
