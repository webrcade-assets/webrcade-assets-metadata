A battle has begun between you and your neighboring base, and it will not end until one of you is destroyed.
Base Conflict is a turn-based artillery game. It is two-player only, and takes place on a random map. On their turn, each player can launch a missile (at a specific angle and power), send a tank (tanks can be armed with up to three missiles, and will, over the course of a few turns, travel to the opponent and attack them at point-blank range), build missiles (each player starts with a finite number of missiles), build a tank (each player starts with a finite number of tanks), see the battle, or ask for reinforcements (which has a chance of increasing base population). A hit will cause the population of the base to decrease, (population acts as health) and will decrease the maximum power that can be used for missiles. The maximum power will regenerate over time.
