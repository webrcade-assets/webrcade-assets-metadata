Sokowahn Pro is a shareware Soko-Ban -like box-pushing puzzle game with colourful high-resolution graphics. The title is a cross-language pun of sorts, as Wahn means "mania" in German. The rules are the same as in Soko-Ban : the player controls a token that moves turn-by-turn on the playing field and can push (but not pull) boxes which need to be moved to specified squares on the field. There is no time limit, but the game will record the number of turns it took the player to solve a puzzle, and the amount of time in seconds spent on playing a level.
There are several features that make Sokowahn Pro stand out from the rest of Soko-Ban clones. First, all puzzles in Sokowahn Pro are entirely original and do not come from other sources. Secondly, there is an option to record a "movie" (replay) of each completed level, and watch replays made by other users. Players are also able to undo their moves in case a wrong step is taken. While there is no in-game music, a built-in CD player allows to listen to the user's audio CD of choice while playing. Additionally, the game comes with a level editor for the creation of custom puzzles.
Sokowahn Pro was sold as shareware, with the unregistered version containing only 20 levels compared to 100 in the registered game, and limited in other ways (the undo function only goes back one turn, there is just one save slot for a user level). Solutions for all puzzles could be ordered separately in the form of replays for the user to watch in-game, alongside a tool to convert levels from other Soko-Ban variants to the Sokowahn Pro format.
