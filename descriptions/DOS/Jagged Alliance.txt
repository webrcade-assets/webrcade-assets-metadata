Jagged Alliance is a turn-based tactical combat game with a mixture of strategy, reminiscent of X-COM games. The player hires and manages a team of mercenaries to resolve a conflict in the fictional country of Metavira, where the Fallow trees which are used for an experimental medicine are forcibly claimed by the evil Santino. Each of the mercenaries have their own personality, and some work well with others, while others do not. Their specialties vary: shooters (both long and short guns), explosive experts (to set or disarm bombs/traps), mechanics/gunsmiths (to fix and modify equipment), and doctors/nurses (to heal wounded mercenaries). Each mercenary also has a different price.In the strategic view, the various sectors of Metavira are visible. The player starts with just one sector, with a few trees for income, as they are used as a resource for a revolutionary medicine. Hold more sectors increases the number of trees held, which will increase income.When moving into an enemy-held sector, the game moves to the top-down, turn-based tactical mode, where movements are based on action points, which limits the number of actions each merc can perform per turn. The action continues until the sector is no longer contested (either one side got wiped out, or retreated to another sector, or both).After the sector is clear, native guards can be called in to hold the sector (which requires payment just like mercenaries), as well as hire more natives to process the newly acquired trees. Mercenaries need to be returned to the homebase if any one was wounded, and let the doctor/nurse treat them. Idle mercenaries at the base can train to improve their ratings. Some scripted events and some random events such as poisoned water, a virus that attacks the trees, the kidnapped daughter of a chief, and others can also occur.
