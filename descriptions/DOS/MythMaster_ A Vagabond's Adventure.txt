MythMaster: A Vagabond's Adventure is the first part in what was planned to be a series of shareware adventure games. Additional parts or sequels were eventually never released. As young Anton Schlepp, a former young farmhand from the kingdom of Ethra also known as the MythMaster, you set out into the troubled kingdom of Cafray searching for adventure.
MythMaster looks and plays similarly to classic Sierra adventure games like King's Quest with 16-color EGA graphics, keyboard controls, a parser interface, and numerous ways to die. There are 206 points to earn.
