Quadrant is another take on the Star Trek school of games: protect the Federation by ridding it of the Klingon menace.  Your part of the galaxy is composed of 8x8 quadrants, each with 8x8 sectors - a sector may either be empty or occupied by a star, a friendly starbase, or a Klingon warship.  You're in command of the USS Enterprise, a prestigious position which chiefly involves typing numbers to interact with the text-based interface.
This time around, the Romulans, Tholians, etc. are staying out of it: the Klingons are your only enemies.  You may choose the total number of starbases and enemy ships, or let the game decide at random.  Impulse power is most useful for traveling inside a quadrant, and the warp engines for traveling between quadrants (though both work for either purpose).
As in other Trek variants, you're equipped with photon torpedoes, phasers and shields, all of which (like your engines) consume energy. You may use your dual-range scanners to map out your environment, send out probes to explore it. Battle may result in damage to your systems; they can be repaired by resting, or by docking at a starbase, which also refills your energy reserves. And when things get too rough, you always have one final option... the self-destruct button.
