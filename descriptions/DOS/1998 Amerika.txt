1998 Amerika is a shareware game similar to Risk but instead of using a map of the world and fighting for countries, this game uses a map of America and the battles are for states. Though this game is based on Risk it does not adhere to the rules of that game, for example when a player wins a battle they win propaganda cards which can be traded for armies.
