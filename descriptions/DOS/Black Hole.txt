A puzzle game that consists of a field of light green squares, framed by dark green squares. Blue and pink balls emerge from the dark green squares and roll randomly around the main field. You can't control them, but you can click an empty square to add a barrier that will direct the balls in one direction or the other.If two balls of the same colour collide, they colour the block with that colour. If balls of different colours collide, they both disappear ("fall into a black hole") and the square where it happened becomes dead space. If a ball of a certain colour passes through a block of the same colour, nothing happens, but if it passes through a block of another colour, it loses colour and becomes light green again.The goal of the game is not obvious: you must destroy a certain number of coloured blocks to move to the next level. A gauge is displayed on the left of the screen that representing the distance from the goal amount of blocks. To summarise, you must first bring balls of the same colour together to create coloured blocks, and then get balls to roll into blocks of the opposite colour.
