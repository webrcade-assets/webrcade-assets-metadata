The name says it all: an early, proof-of-concept side-scrolling platform game exercise. The player controls a little man who moves from side to side with the arrow keys and jumps in little hops continuing in the direction he was last moving. His goal? To dodge slowly falling bombs and collect the level's 39 gold coins. If not for its illustrious author, the generic game would likely have been forgotten forever. It is succeeded by Super Silverbrothers.
