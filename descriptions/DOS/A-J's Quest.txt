The character can also collect money, to buy equipment in a store at the end of each level. Different equipment lends the character, A-J Bear, different attacks of various effectiveness on different monsters. Through most of the game A-J Bear is also trailed by his pet hedgehog, Hedge, who can be of occasional aid against monsters.Depending on the game version, the order, number, and layout of levels may vary. Early versions include secret bonus stages, to be found in each level. Later versions include a more elaborate presentation, extra levels, and significant bug fixes.
