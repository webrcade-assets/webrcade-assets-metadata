The Master of Mischief is at it again. This time he has devised a great spelling bee in which he will submit robots to win the spelling bee for him!
When you first log in, you will be asked to chose a category of words (Holiday, homophones, etc.). You are then brought to a screen with three options: Crisscross, Flash Cards, and Word Search. Crisscross is a sort of crossword puzzle, but instead of clues you just need to figure out where the words go. Flash cards are flash cardsâ€¦ You hear or see a word and then spell it out. Word finder is a grid filled with letters wherein several words are hidden.
Once you finish the above you can enter a spelling bee where you face the Master of Mischief and/or his robots. Winning opens up new levels of competition such as Regional or International.
