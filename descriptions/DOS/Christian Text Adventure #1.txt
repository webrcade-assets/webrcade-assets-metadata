Christian Text Adventure #1, true to its title, is a text adventure game based on religious themes. It was developed using the "Generic Adventure Game System" (GAGS) software. The protagonist finds himself in a large white room, a lightweight armor on his body but nothing else on his person. After getting out of the room, the player explores a futuristic building and a medieval castle, occasionally solving a simple puzzle to open secret passages. Allegorical monsters (such as the "snake of Deception" or "wolf of Unbelief") are found in some rooms, and must be killed with the appropriate spiritual weapon (such as the "rod of Truth" or "sword of Spirit").After dying or winning the game, your score, the number of rooms visited and the number of turns taken is displayed.
