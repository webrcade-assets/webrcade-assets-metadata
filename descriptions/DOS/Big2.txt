Big2 is a single-player, mouse-controlled shareware card game. Big2 is said to have originated in Hong Kong where it is the second most popular game, the most popular still being mahjong. The game is normally played by four players, in this implementation the computer plays three of them North, West, East while the player sits in the South chair and, by default, is called Eric though all the names can be changed. The object of the game is to play all the cards from your hand as the cards that remain in the hands of other players will count against them.The game has optional sound effects, optional music and will keep a log of the scores. The default score ends the game at ninety-nine points but this can be customised. The game does not have an option to customise the skill level of the AI opponents. The game is designed to be played using the mouse, if the player does not have one they can use the -nomouse command-line parameter which allows them to use the keyboard to move the mouse pointer.
