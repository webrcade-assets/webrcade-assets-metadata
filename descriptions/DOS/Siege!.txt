Siege! is a game about building castles. Castles can be constructed from walls, towers, gates, and moats. After designing a castle, it's built over time, but every day there's a chance that the castle will be attacked by enemy troops. When that happens, distribute your infantry, archers, and leader. Infantry moves toward the enemy, attacking when possible, archers attack from range and can be placed on walls and towers, and if the leader is captured, the game ends. Troops will fight automatically, or can be given direct orders if needed.
