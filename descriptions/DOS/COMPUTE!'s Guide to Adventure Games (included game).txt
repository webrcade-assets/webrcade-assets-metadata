In this demonstration game, whose type-in source code is included in the book to demonstrate text adventure game programming, the player must venture into a defunct factory tower (based on a real building in Manchester, NH) in hopes of retrieving magnetic media on which is stored a copy of Crowther & Woods' inaugural adventure game, ADVENTURE. Typical text adventure adversaries of vermin and small animals interfere with the efforts, and must be overcome through the solving of standard text adventure puzzles.
Three versions of this game's source code are included in the book, for Microsoft BASIC, modified Microsoft BASIC for Atari computers, and for TI BASIC.
