Neverworld is an Italian-language adventure game with some arcade elements. The game is set in a future version of Taipei called New Tai, where you play as investigator Joshua Jam, a frequenter of both the slums of the city and of the worst areas of Neverworld, a parallel virtual world.
This was to be part of a series of magazines and games available in kiosks that would be called Raven, that would contain interconnected stories and video games all set in the same fictional world. Only the first issue with this game was released.
The game was made freeware by developer Ivan Venturi in 2010.
