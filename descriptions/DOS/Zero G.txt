Zero G is a futuristic racing/combat game made in QuickBasic that was inspired by WipEout. The player's objective is to participate in races against AI-controlled opponents, and earn credits to purchase even more powerful vehicles. There are four tracks of increasing difficulty and correspondingly larger reward for winning the race, and six racing craft (including the player's starting vehicle) with progressively better speed and other characteristics.
The player begins with zero credits and the weakest racing craft possible, and can slowly accumulate more credits by participating in races. During play, it is possible to use weapons like missiles and bombs against the competitors to win the race, and the AI pilots will do likewise whenever possible. Tracks may be played in any order but more difficult ones will likely require more powerful vehicles to stand a chance. There is neither a save/load game option, nor a scoreboard to keep track of the player's progress. There are no sound effects or music.
Zero G was released as freeware by its author.
