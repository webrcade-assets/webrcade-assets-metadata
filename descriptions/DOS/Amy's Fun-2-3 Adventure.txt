Amy's Fun-2-3 Adventure is an educational game featuring the dog Amy, with four different game modes intended to teach children how to count and to play music.
The first game mode has the player click on a number from 1 to 10 on top of the screen. Then, Amy will perform some kind of action to illustrate the numer: throwing a ball up in the air as many times as the clicked number, barking as many times as the clicked number, etc. There's also voice acting that counts out the numbers: if you click on the number 5, for example, it will count out "One, two, three, four, five."
The second game mode is a little more involved. A machine displays a number in the middle, and groups of items on the left and the right. The player has to click on the item group that has as many items in it as the number in the middle. Clicking the correct group will drop a tasty treat from the machine for Amy to eat, while clicking the wrong group will make her whine with disappointment.
The third game mode features a xylophone on which the player can play music, as well as a selection of children's songs with instructions on how to play them.
The fourth game mode has Amy repair a castle wall destroyed by a dragon. To do that, the player has to place building blocks in the correct positions. Amy will count out numbers on her paws and the player has to drop the building block onto the slot with the correct number. If she holds up five fingers, the block has to be dropped on the slot with a 5 on it, for example.
