Mandrake the Magician sets off to find his friend Lothar, who has disappeared all of a sudden. The few clues in his possession lead Mandrake to the gate of a huge yet seemingly abandoned mansion. Little does he know he has just found the secret headquarters of his arch-nemesis, the Cobra.
Mandrake: L'Ombra del Cobra (Shadow of the Cobra) is an adventure game produced by the Mandrake the Magician comic publisher for Italy. As Mandrake, the player moves across fixed two-dimensional screens. In addition to moving around, interacting with objects and talking to people, Mandrake will occasionally need to use his magic in combat. The game can be played entirely with the keyboard, though partial mouse control is also available. However, similarly to Holodream 's own Flash Gordon game, the cursor does not highlight objects of interest, therefore some pixel hunting is required.
