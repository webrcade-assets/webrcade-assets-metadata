After the events of the the first game, Al Pond has become an NBI agent and remains on Nonytoonyfatso Island. In this game, players accompany Al Pond as he investigates the case of the missing island chief. The entire game unfolds on Nonytoonyfatso Island, which consists of interconnected fixed screens.The most significant change compared to the predecessor is the use of Sierra's SCI engine instead of AGI. As a result, players can now alternatively use the mouse to move Al around. However, commands still need to be typed into the parser. Some character sprites are ripped from Leisure Suit Larry III.
