Beasley's Deathtrap is an extremely simple choose-your-own-adventure game based on pure trial and error. The game presents you with a situation and two possible options. You have to pick either option 1 or option 2 - one progresses the game and the other leads to your death. Finding the correct option usually relies on pure luck: do you take the left or the right path? Do you push the blue or the red button? There are no real hints towards which option is the correct one, so the only way to beat the game is to try out each option and note down which is the correct one, then restart from the beginning when you fail.
