Bang-ul-wa Bang-ulsai is a Bust-A-Move variant. The playing screen features a number of colored bubbles, and the player shoots one new bubble at a time into the field. This bubble has a fixed color and is positioned at the bottom of the screen. The direction is chosen by moving a directional arrow along a sphere. The bubble connects to the first field bubble it touches and can bounce off the left and right walls. When three bubbles of the same color connect, they disappear, along with any bubbles that are no longer connected to the top.Every few moves (the exact number depends on the chosen difficulty level), the playing field shrinks, moving all bubbles closer to the bottom. If a bubble touches the lower boundary, the game is lost. The goal is to clear all bubbles to advance to the next of the 50 stages.
