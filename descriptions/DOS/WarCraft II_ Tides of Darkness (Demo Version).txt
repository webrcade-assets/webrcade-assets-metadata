The demo version of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness contains two 3-mission campaigns, one for each side, with unique missions that are not included in the retail version of the game. The campaigns are more or less comparable to Act I of respective sides' full campaigns, but the maps, objectives and briefing text are not the same. This release also includes a limited version of the Map Editor that does not allow to save user created maps, or use any units, structures or terrain types not featured in the demo. A unique feature in the demo is a built-in preview slide show that describes the full game; some of the images show old, pre-release graphics of certain units and structures.
The demo was released both as an Internet download (which is no longer available from Blizzards FTP site for some reason) and on CD for retail distribution. The cut-down Internet version does not have voice-over narration in briefings and the preview slide show, and also uses a slide-show version of the introduction movie. The CD version, on the other hand, does not have these limitations and also includes CD Audio soundtrack and previews of other Blizzard products.
