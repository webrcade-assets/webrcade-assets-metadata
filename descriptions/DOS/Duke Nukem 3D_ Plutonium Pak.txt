Duke Nukem is forced back into action. It seems that the despite having their collective butt kicked back in Duke Nukem 3D, the aliens have not given up, and have now created a Queen that will be their new leader. Duke sets out to kill the Queen and teach the aliens a lesson once again.
Duke Nukem 3D: Plutonium Pak is an add-on for the first-person shooter Duke Nukem 3D. It adds a new 11-level episode, "The Birth".
This new episode includes new enemies: the Protector Drones who can slash at Duke with their claws or shoot shrinking rays at him, and the Pig Cop Tank, an impressive piece of machinery outfitted with deadly machine guns. There is also a new weapon - the Microwave Expander, which inflates aliens until they explode. And, of course, there is a new boss to defeat - the Alien Queen herself.
The Plutonium Pak also includes themes for Windows 95, screen savers, and a multiplayer bot feature.
