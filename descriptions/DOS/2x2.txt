2x2 is a game for learning multiplication tables. The game is a Tetris variant. The game takes place in the same manner, except that the player does not stack bricks but digits. The player's task is to choose the correct digit arising from a multiplication operation. If correct, the selection is deleted, if not, it remains. After three correct answers in a row one incorrect block is removed. The game allows players to configure advanced multiplication tables and determine which part of the mathematical equation they will complement.
