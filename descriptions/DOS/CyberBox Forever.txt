CyberBox Forever is an unofficial "sequel" to Doug Beeferman's CyberBox. Much like the other CyberBox fangame, The Continuing Adventures of CyberBox, Forever retains the original game mechanics (in contrast with the official Cyberbox II), but features new custom tilesets and includes 15 challenging levels. An advanced mouse-driven level editor is also provided.
The objective of each level is to guide the player character to the exit, which is typically blocked by various obstacles, most commonly pushable boxes that need to be rearranged to clear the path. Various combinations of items with specific properties, such as boxes than can only be pushed in on direction, or one-way passages, facilitate the creation of complex puzzles that may take hours to solve.
CyberBox Forever was released as freeware.
