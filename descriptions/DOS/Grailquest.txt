A game in the world of the legendary King Arthur, but adding a few more features than your "run of the mill" adventure. This game also includes adult "situations" that add to the classic motif. During the actual quest for the search of the grail, there are sub-quests to master as well. A VERY detailed graphic adventure game that has a very high-end interactive fiction storyline. This game uses a "point and shoot" interface that uses your mouse.
