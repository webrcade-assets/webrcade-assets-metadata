Destiny is a single player, freeware, text adventure based on the Christian faith. All scripture quotations are from the New American Standard Version of the bible.
Unusually the game starts when the player dies. They reawaken in a corridor where there are two doors one for sinners and one for good people. The objective of the game is to explore the various rooms where there are 'Points of Decision' or 'Turning Points' at which the player must make a choice.
In the documentation the author makes it clear that the object of the game is to win and that, in terms of the game designers intention, is achieved by getting to a final location. However the adventure toolkit used to develop the game counts a win when the player achieves a number of points so at some point the player is given a goal to achieve.
