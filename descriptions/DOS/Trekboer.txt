You find yourself in command of the starship Trekboer as your adventure begins. A deadly virus has struck earth and threatens the future of humankind. In this mission you use the starship Trekboer to search the galaxy far and wide for a cure before it is too late. Returning to Earth empty handed is not an option.
Trekboer is a graphical interactive fiction game that uses standard single-letter directions, N, S, E, W, for movement. You can also SAVE your current location on cassette for restarting later. The command parser is a standard verb-noun type. During your adventure you will encounter planets to explore, teleporters, and warp jumps.
