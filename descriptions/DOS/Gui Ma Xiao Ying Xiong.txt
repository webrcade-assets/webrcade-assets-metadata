Gui Ma Xiao Ying Xiong is a role-playing game with humorous elements. When Liao Fan and Liao Kong arrived at the back hill to visit their master, their uncle guarded at the door, so that neither of them could enter. In the monk's house not far from the entrance of the cave, they heard the monks talking and felt that there was something wrong with it. They went to the abbot's house to see the abbot, and found that he was really hurt. Wandering outside the Lohan Hall, they learned that Kong Jie is simple-minded and illiterate. In the monastery above the hall, they painted a paper document. Use this paper to cheat Kong Jie. The banned master instructed them to go to Wudang and from there the story starts.
