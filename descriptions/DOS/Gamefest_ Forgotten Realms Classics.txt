A compilation of compilations! Interplay continues to support the classic Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game series by combining their three Forgotten Realms Archives sets into one bargain priced dual-jewel package (two CD jewel boxes in a cardboard sleeve). The set includes:
Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection One

Eye of the Beholder I
Eye of the Beholder II
Eye of the Beholder III

Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two

Curse of the Azure Bonds
Gateway to the Savage Frontier
Hillsfar
Pools of Darkness
Pool of Radiance
Secret of the Silver Blades
Treasures of the Savage Frontier

Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Three

Dungeon Hack
Menzoberranzan
Blood & Magic
Baldur's Gate Chapters I & II

Although there is no hard copy documentation, this compilation does come with two code wheels for 'translating' the copy protection on Hillsfar, Curse of the Azure Bonds, and Pool of Radiance. Collectors will also note that this exact same set of games was released by Interplay as the Forgotten Realms Archives Silver Edition in 1999.
