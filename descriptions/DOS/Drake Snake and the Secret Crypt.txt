Drake Snake and the Secret Crypt is a platform game where the player controls the eponymous Drake, who came to Africa in hopes of finding treasure. His plane crashes in the middle of jungle and Drake finds himself inside a cave complex.Drake explores the 13 levels of underground caverns and tries to find the exit while avoiding or killing the enemies within. Enemy creatures involve man-eating plants, spiders, birds and scorpions. Some enemies kill Drake instantly, while others just drain his health (not to mention that Drake's health is constantly falling slowly). Drake's main assets include: his jetpack which allows him to fly (but has limited fuel), a gun (with limited ammo) and bombs which can be set on the ground. Some walls can be blown up with bombs.
