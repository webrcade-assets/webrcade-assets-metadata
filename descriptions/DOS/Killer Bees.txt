In this simple mouse-driven shooter, you protect a man who enjoys hanging out under hives full of angry bees.  Not the brightest thing to do, perhaps, since he also seems to be rather allergic - a single sting will make him drop dead on the spot.  Be that as it may, the bees attack in groups of four, and your job is to pick them off in the air using your crosshair.  Try to exterminate as many as you can before one of them reaches the man and puts an end to his poorly-chosen hobby.
