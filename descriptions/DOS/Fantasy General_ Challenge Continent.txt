Challenge Continent is a free add-on for Fantasy General, consisting of a five-battle mini-campaign designed for experienced players. In this scenario, the Council of Five has decided to launch its rebellion against the Shadowlord with a campaign against Aelcar the Shadow Wizard on the Isle of Four Winds. While Sir Kalador is tasked to lead the assault, the player is in charge of the smaller force held in reserve, just in case.
