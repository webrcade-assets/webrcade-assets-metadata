Lost Gold: The Search For The Lost Dutchman Gold Mine is a text adventure about finding The Lost Dutchman Gold Mine. You have taken a thirty day vacation from work, loaded your motorhome with supplies, and driven off to a camp ground near to the Superstition Mountains. The bad news is that you left most of your supplies at home. The good news is that there's a fairy willing to send you back to 1895. The bad news is that there isn't an obvious way back home.
While the game follows the usual text adventure rules, it has a move limit in the form of your grubstake. It starts at $1000, and decreases by a dollar for every action you take.
The game was distributed as shareware, but without missing features.
