A strategy game played on a 3x3 board; each tile has two sides, one black and one white, and the game begins with the board in a random state. A tile can be flipped by entering its number on the keyboard, but only if it is currently white. Flipping the central one will also flip the four tiles connected to it; a corner piece will flip the 3 surrounding ones along with it, and the tiles in the middle of each edge cause the entire edge to flip.
The game keeps track of elapsed time and the number of moves made. To win, the player must flip the tiles until the central one is black, and all the others are white. If all tiles are flipped to the black position, the game is lost.
Flipper was included as part of the Mind Boggle compilation from Keypunch Software.
