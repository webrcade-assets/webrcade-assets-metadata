Connect4 is an implementation of the Milton-Bradley tabletop game Connect Four for a single player. In an 8×8 grid, the player and computer take turns to drop tokens of their color into one of the columns. Tokens drop the bottom-most row that is still vacant. The goal is to create a row, column, or diagonal line of four tokens in one's own color, while preventing the opponent from doing the same first.The game offers one difficulty level, and the player can choose whether they want to go first, or the computer should make the first move. A column for the next move is chosen by typing one of the numbers 1–8 on the keyboard.
