Written as an entry for the 100KB PC Game compo at the Inscene 2000 demoparty, Out 'M' Up is a simple futuristic scrolling shooter: blast your way through endless alien attacks without getting blasted yourself, and try to take down as many of the oncoming hostiles as possible, as they keep pouring out from the top of the playfield.
Your feisty little fighter ship can withstand a few hits from enemy fire, but once all power is gone - a life is lost. Some of the vanquished foes will drop power-ups, allowing you to upgrade your ammo type and firing speed. The alien assaults come in waves; when the final wave is done with, the game will loop back to the beginning.
