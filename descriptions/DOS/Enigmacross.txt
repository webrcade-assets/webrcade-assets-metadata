Enigmacross is a single-player, shareware word game, which is an adaptation of the "acrostic" word puzzle (a variant of a crossword). It comes with seven puzzles and the option to create more. Additional puzzles were promised on registration.
The game area is divided into three areas:

The top half of the screen is the puzzle to be solved. This looks like a standard crossword but it is not, when completed the puzzle will reveal itself to be a passage of text with the spaces removed.

Below the puzzle is a second grid. In the supplied puzzles this is a single row of around twenty cells but there is scope for it being much bigger. When the player clicks on a cell they are given a clue to a word. When they enter their answer, the letters of the answer are transferred to the main puzzle, whether the supplied answer is right or wrong. When all the words are correctly entered, the puzzle is complete and the passage of text can be read in full. The initial letter of each entered answer remains in the 'clue grid' to show which questions have been answered and which remain. When a puzzle is completed, these initial letters can form an additional solution, e.g. the original author and source of the passage of text.

The lower third of the screen contains the controls for starting, saving, printing and solving a game together with the button to commence construction of a new game.
