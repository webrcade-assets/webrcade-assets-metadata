"PC Basket" is the first game of the "PC Basket" series, a saga of budget prized games that blend a database of the Spanish basketball teams of the era and a basketball simulator.
Since this is the first in the series, it is the most limited in scope. The team database only includes 8 teams, their internal data (statistics, player names) corresponding to the 1993 league, and the basketball simulator is almost bare bones.
In fact, when using the simulator the player is limited to "shouting" a couple of instructions to the players, such as "pass the ball" or "try to score", something that the game proudly calls "coach mode".
