Time Hunter Pinball is a pinball simulator with only one table, a preshistoric jungle theme. The table layout is quite strange, since it is divided in two parts, left and right. You start playing in the left part on the screen, and you aim to reach the right part. The view is top-down, but it's non-scrolling. Like any pinball, there are targets, ramps, blocks, and so on. The game features a highscore table and the sound can be toggled on/off from the main menu.
