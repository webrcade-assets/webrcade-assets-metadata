This remake of an obscure game from 1983 adds new graphics, sounds and music while maintaining the simple but unique gameplay of the original. The player controls a blue X called Zippy, moving it through a labyrinth filled with dangerous obstacles and dead ends. The maze moves independently from the character, and the main objective is to keep shifting position to avoid collision with the surrounding red brick wall that stays in place. Zippy can collect certain objects like grass and plums, but dies when touching the wall or certain hazardous environments and enemies.
