Dead of Night is a side-scrolling action-adventure game set in the world of Ancient Greek mythology. The protagonist is a citizen of Athens called Heropheles who is tasked by Zeus and the other Olympian gods to help prevent Hades from merging the world of the living with the Underworld. Heropheles journeys into Hades' realm and must overcome various perils to complete his quest, restore order to the world, and save his brother.The player character can move left and right, jump and crouch, and climb ladders. There are several different weapons to be found and used throughout the game, including a sword, a bow, a mace and a whip, each with several attack modes. The Underworld is full of monsters from Greek mythology, such as Minotaurs and Harpies, alongside more generic undead creatures, skeletons and zombies.The released version of Dead of Night only contains the first quest given by Zeus to Heropheles: to slay the Hydra and retrieve the map of the Underworld. The continuation of the story is hinted at but was apparently never done, otherwise the game is feature-complete.
