The Trooper is a hack-and-slash action platformer set during the Crimean War. As a British cavalryman, mounted on horseback and wielding a sword, your mission is simple: kill the Russian soldiers before they kill you - with their muskets, mortars and quick-draw handguns. Each stage requires you to fill up your "kill" meter; once you've butchered the necessary number of enemy soldiers, you're free to make your way to the exit. Your slain foes will randomly drop power-ups, giving you temporary invulnerability, extra lives, and even a fireball-shooting sword.
Done in tribute to Iron Maiden and their song of the same name. The author has also released a cover of the song (in .XM FastTracker format), which can be used in-game as background music.
