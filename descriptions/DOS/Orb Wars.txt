The Voltrath have been mining planets in order to make the ultimate weapon, and you have been given the Schzion fighter armed with planet busters to stop them.
Orb Wars is a game about destroying planets in a solar system using limited ammo. The planets, your ship, and your shots all orbit a star at the center of the map, and you need to carefully consider gravity in order to hit the planets. There are three galaxies; you move to the next level after running out of shots. The second galaxy adds comets that have odd orbits. The third galaxy has multiple planets orbiting each star.
There is also a two-player mode. Here, the first player to shoot the other player 10 times wins. There is unlimited ammo in this mode.
Orb Wars was distributed as shareware. The registered version has Sound Blaster support, the shareware version just has PC speaker.
