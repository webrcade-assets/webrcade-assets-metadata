In 226 AD, King Li Shimin of Qin launched Xuanwumen, a coup set in Tang Dynasty in China. Under the cover of loyal generals, the princess, who was pregnant, fled to TuJue in the Western Regions. She sought to be anonymous, living in seclusion, and received the courtesy of the local people. Time flies and the Tang Dynasty developed into a powerful empire with prosperity. The descendants of the prince had to live in seclusion in the deep mountains and accumulate their courage in order to recover their great career. One night, in a luxurious manor on a hill outside Broken Leaves City in the Western Regions, a confused mother dreamed that Taiplatinum was flying into her arms. Subsequently, a boy with an extraordinary appearance was born, and his father named him Li Bai. This game is a role-playing game about the adventures of Li Bai.
