Major Stryker is another of Apogee's attempts to make a commercial-level shareware game. It's a rather typical shoot-'em-up vertical scroller with EGA graphics.
The player fights through waves of Kreton alien enemies to reach the end of each level, with hostages to rescue along the way. The shipâ€™s weapons consists of beam projectiles (which can be upgraded six times, but is reverted to level one if hit), and limited zap bombs, which clear the screen. There are also various power-ups in the form of letters and temporary shields. After every two levels, the player fights a Kreton boss, which has a certain weak point to shoot multiple times.
