Alchemy is a puzzle game. When starting a new game, the player is presented with a few basic elements (e.g. fire, water, air) which are represented by icons or words. The goal is simply to drag two or more elements together to create different substances, e.g. water and soil combine to a swamp. Those can then be used to create more substances or dismantled if desired. After players have progressed to more advanced technologies, they may discover shortcuts to create certain substances faster or in larger quantities. It is also possible to receive more of the four basic elements with a simple button press. There is no defined goal except experimenting until everything has been discovered.
