Ma≈Ça Ortografia is an educational adaptation of the classical concept of snake games. The player has to guide a worm through a board full of letters. The player must feed the worm with a missing letter from a word displayed above to score points and gain access to the next level. However, feeding the worm makes it grow longer. The worm loses a point when he bites its own tail, hits a border wall or swallows a wrong letter. The game setup allows to choose one of two movement modes - continuous or at the player's request.
