Bug Adventure is an educational title in 'Adventure' series that is composed out of a set of activities and small games developed for young children and aimed at teaching them about the world of insects.
'Activities' that kids can engage into include an illustrated and animated 'Bug Reference' (Encyclopedia), 'Bug Storybook' that narrates some short tales from the lives of the arthropods, 'Honeycomb Theater' with short videos of the insects in action, a separate section of 3D pictures (intended to be viewed with 3D glasses), and two games: 'Can you find me?' (the task is to identify the bug on one of the four provided pictures by its description) and 'Who am I?' (where kinds have to name the insect basing on its close-up picture).
