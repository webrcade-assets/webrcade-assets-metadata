Baccarat is an implementation of the Baccarat card betting game, in the Mini-Baccarat version. Players take no influence on the progression of the hands in this game, they merely bet on the outcomes. Bets can be placed on a win for the Player's hand, the Banker's hand, or a tie. Bets on two or three of these positions can be combined for one hand. A scorecard shows the outcomes of each hand, and the dealt cards are displayed on the screen.Apart from adjusting bets manually, the game also offers automated betting systems, such as Martingale or D'Alembert. Once a system is selected, players can continue to normally progress through the hands and see their bets adjust automatically according to the system, or they can enable the Auto Play feature to run a given number of hands in a row. This also works when no betting system is activated, in which case the bets stay the same for all rounds.
