The first entry in the acclaimed 'Blue Destiny' trilogy. This is a first-person cockpit shooter where players pilot a GM to hunt down the mysterious 'Blue Destiny' unit. The game features a gritty, realistic take on the Gundam universe, focusing on the tactical feel of piloting a giant robot. Missions involve both search-and-destroy and defensive objectives. This first volume established the trilogy's high-quality 3D engine and its compelling side-story narrative set during the One Year War.
