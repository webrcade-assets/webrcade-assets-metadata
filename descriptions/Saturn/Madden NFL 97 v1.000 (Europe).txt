The Saturn version of Madden 97 marked the series' move into the 32-bit era. It uses the 'Liquid AI' system to provide more realistic player behavior and features all the teams and players from the 1996 NFL season. The game uses a 2D-on-3D engine, with sprite-based players on a fully 3D polygonal field, allowing for dynamic camera angles and smooth scrolling. The European version includes all the deep play-calling and season modes that made Madden the premier name in American football simulations.
