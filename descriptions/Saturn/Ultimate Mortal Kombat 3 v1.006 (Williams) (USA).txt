The definitive version of MK3 for the Saturn, Ultimate MK3 brings back fan-favorite characters like Scorpion and Kitana while introducing new ones like Ermac and Rain. This US version is a highly faithful arcade port, featuring massive sprites and high-resolution backgrounds. It includes the series' signature brutal Fatalities and the new 'Animality' finishers. The Saturn version is widely regarded as one of the best home conversions of the game due to its responsive controls and the inclusion of the full arcade intro and ending sequences.
