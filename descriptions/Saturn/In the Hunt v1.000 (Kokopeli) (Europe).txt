Developed by the team that would go on to create Metal Slug, In the Hunt is a visually stunning submarine-based shooter. Players navigate through detailed underwater environments, blasting through massive naval fleets and ancient sea monsters. The game is famous for its incredible 2D pixel art and destructible environments. The Saturn version is a very faithful port of the arcade original, though it experiences some slowdown during the most chaotic moments. It remains a standout 'cult' shooter for the system due to its unique setting and art style.
