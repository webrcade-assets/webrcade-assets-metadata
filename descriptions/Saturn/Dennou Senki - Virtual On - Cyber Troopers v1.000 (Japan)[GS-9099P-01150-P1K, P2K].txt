A landmark title for the Saturn, Virtual On brings the high-speed arena combat of the arcade to the home. Players pilot 'Virtuaroids,' giant mechs designed by Hajime Katoki, engaging in 1-on-1 battles using long-range lasers and close-quarters energy weapons. The game is designed for the Twin Stick controller, which allows for complex dashing and jumping maneuvers. This initial Japanese release captures the frantic energy and tactical depth of the arcade original perfectly.
