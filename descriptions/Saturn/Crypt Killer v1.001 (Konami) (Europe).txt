A port of the arcade hit Henry Explorers, Crypt Killer is a horror-themed light gun game where players explore various mythological locations like ancient Egypt and underwater ruins. The game features branching paths and massive, screen-filling bosses. Players must shoot through waves of skeletons, gargoyles, and other monsters while collecting weapon power-ups like shotguns and Gatling guns. The Saturn version supports both the Virtua Gun and the standard controller, offering a frantic arcade experience at home.
