A stylish 2.5D platformer where players control Johnny, a rock star who travels to the underworld to rescue his guitar 'Anita' from a demon. The game features a unique pre-rendered aesthetic similar to Donkey Kong Country, with detailed, fluidly animated character models. Johnny uses his guitar as a weapon to blast ghosts and monsters, and can even use it as a jetpack-style hover device. The European version features a high-quality jazz and rock-infused soundtrack that complements the game's cool, musical theme.
