Arcana Strikes is a tactical role-playing game that heavily incorporates card-battle mechanics. Battles take place on a grid-based map where players move their characters and utilize a deck of cards to perform attacks, summon creatures, or cast powerful defensive spells. Outside of battle, players explore a fantasy world and collect new cards to customize their strategy, making it a unique hybrid of tactical positioning and deck-building.
