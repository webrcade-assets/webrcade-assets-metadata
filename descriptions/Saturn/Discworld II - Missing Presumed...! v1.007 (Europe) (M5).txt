A sequel to the original Discworld adventure, this game is based on Terry Pratchett’s beloved fantasy novels. Players control the inept wizard Rincewind (voiced by Eric Idle) as he tries to convince Death to return to his job. The game features beautiful, high-resolution hand-drawn animation that looks like a high-quality cartoon. The puzzles are notoriously difficult and rely on 'Discworld logic,' but the witty writing and faithful adaptation of the source material make it a delight for fans of the books.
