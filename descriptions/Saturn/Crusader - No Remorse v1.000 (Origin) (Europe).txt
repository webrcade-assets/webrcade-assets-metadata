An isometric action game where players take the role of a 'Silencer,' a defecting elite soldier for the World Economic Consortium. The game is famous for its highly interactive and destructible environments—almost everything on screen can be blown up or manipulated. Players use a massive arsenal of high-tech weapons and can even hack into computer terminals to control enemy turrets. The Saturn version successfully translates the complex PC controls to a gamepad and includes the original's atmospheric FMV cutscenes.
