Based on the cult comic book by Rob Schrab, Scud is a unique hybrid of a side-scrolling action game and a light gun shooter. Players control a robotic assassin on a quest for self-preservation. The game allows for two players to play simultaneously: one controlling Scud's movement like a platformer, and the other aiming and shooting at enemies. It features a zany, irreverent sense of humor and a distinct art style that faithfully recreates the look of the comic book. It supports the Virtua Gun for its shooting segments.
