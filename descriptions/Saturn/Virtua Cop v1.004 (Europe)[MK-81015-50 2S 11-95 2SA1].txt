The European version of Virtua Cop, optimized for PAL televisions. This release maintained the high-intensity gameplay of the arcade, requiring players to have fast reflexes to earn 'Justice Shots' by disarming enemies rather than killing them. The game features a memorable soundtrack and tight, responsive controls that translate perfectly from the arcade cabinet to the Saturn controller or Virtua Gun. It is a must-play title that highlights the system's ability to handle complex 3D environments and fast-moving polygonal objects.
