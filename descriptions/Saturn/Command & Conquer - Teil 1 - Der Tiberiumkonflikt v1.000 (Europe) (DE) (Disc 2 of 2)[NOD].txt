The second half of the German Tiberium Conflict release, containing the Brotherhood of Nod campaign. Players follow the charismatic and mysterious Kane in a quest to overthrow the GDI world order through guerrilla warfare and advanced technology. The game includes the 'Covert Operations' missions directly on the disc. The Saturn version supports the Sega Mouse, which is highly recommended for managing the complex unit movement and base-building mechanics that the game requires.
