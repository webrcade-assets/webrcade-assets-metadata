Clockwork Knight 2 builds upon the foundation of the original with more complex level designs and a wider variety of interactive elements. Players must guide Pepperouchau through stages like a toy-filled kitchen and a room full of clocks, using his key-blade to attack enemies and interact with machinery. A notable feature is the inclusion of the 'Boss Galore' mode and hidden collectible cards. The European version features the high-quality pre-rendered FMV sequences that tell a charming, toy-centric story suitable for all ages.
