Fighting Vipers introduced a more 'attitude-heavy' approach to 3D fighting compared to the more serious Virtua Fighter. The game’s main gimmicks are the armor system—where characters take more damage once their protective gear is destroyed—and the enclosed cages that surround every arena. Players can use the walls to perform wall-jumps or knock their opponents through the cage for a cinematic finish. The European version is a faithful arcade port with vibrant graphics and a catchy rock soundtrack.
