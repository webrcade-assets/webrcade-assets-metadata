Croc is a 3D platformer featuring a lovable crocodile on a mission to rescue the Gobbos from the evil Baron Dante. The game features vibrant, colorful worlds and a 'tank-style' control scheme for 3D navigation. Players must explore stages to find hidden Gobbos, collect crystals, and defeat various quirky bosses. The Saturn version is noted for its impressive draw distance and the high quality of its textured environments, serving as a solid alternative to Super Mario 64 for Saturn owners.
