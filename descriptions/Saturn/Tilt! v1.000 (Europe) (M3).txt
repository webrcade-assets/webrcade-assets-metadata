Tilt! (known as Hyper 3-D Pinball in North America) is a high-speed pinball simulation featuring six diverse tables, each with its own theme and mechanics. The game utilizes the Saturn's high-resolution modes to provide crisp table art and realistic ball physics. Tables like 'Monster' and 'Gangster' include multi-ball modes, hidden ramps, and digital mini-games on the dot-matrix display. It is frequently praised for its responsive controls and the variety of camera angles that allow players to view the action from either a top-down or scrolling perspective.
