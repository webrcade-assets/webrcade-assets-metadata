Actua Golf provides a fully 3D golfing simulation, moving away from the static, photo-based backgrounds of earlier sports titles. It features multiple camera angles, realistic physics for ball flight and terrain friction, and a variety of professional-style courses. Players can customize their golfers and compete in different tournament formats, with the engine providing real-time lighting changes and a detailed commentary system that reacts to the player's performance.
