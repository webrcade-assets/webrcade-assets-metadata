One of the Saturn's earliest standout titles, Clockwork Knight is a 2.5D platformer set in a house where toys come to life when the humans are asleep. Players control the bumbling but brave tin soldier Pepperouchau as he fights through a giant-sized living room and bedroom to rescue the Princess. The game was a visual showcase at launch, featuring digitized sprites and 3D background elements, all running with a catchy 'toy-pop' soundtrack that defines the early Saturn era.
