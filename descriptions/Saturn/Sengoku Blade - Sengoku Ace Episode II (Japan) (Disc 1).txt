The sequel to the vertical shooter Sengoku Ace, this game switches to a horizontal scrolling format. Developed by Psikyo, it features beautiful 2D sprites, a feudal Japanese fantasy setting, and eccentric character designs. Players choose from characters like the shrine maiden Koyori or the monk Tengai. It is known for its tight controls, 'charge shot' mechanics, and branching paths.
