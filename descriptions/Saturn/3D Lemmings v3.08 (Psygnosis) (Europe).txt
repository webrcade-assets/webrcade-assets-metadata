3D Lemmings takes the classic puzzle formula of the franchise and moves it into a fully three-dimensional environment. Players must navigate a set number of lemmings from an entrance to an exit by assigned specific tasks like digging, building bridges, or acting as blockers. The 3D perspective introduces complex multi-layered environments, requiring players to rotate the camera frequently to manage the pathfinding of their mindless charges across 100 challenging levels.
