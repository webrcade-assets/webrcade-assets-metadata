The Japanese release of the arcade motorbike hit. Known for its intense sense of speed and the challenging 'Manx' circuit, which features dozens of dangerous corners. This version is prized for its technical polish and the inclusion of various hidden modes (including a 'Sheep' racer). The Saturn port was highly praised for how well it translated the complex arcade geometry to home hardware, maintaining the excitement and difficulty that made the original a staple of mid-90s arcades.
