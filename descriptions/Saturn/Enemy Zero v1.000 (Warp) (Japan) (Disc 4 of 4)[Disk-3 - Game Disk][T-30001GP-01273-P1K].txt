The final disc of the Enemy Zero saga. This disc leads to the climax of the story, featuring the most intense 'invisible' combat sequences and the final escape from the doomed space station. Like its predecessor 'D', the game features multiple endings based on the player’s choices and efficiency. It remains one of the most polarizing and innovative horror titles on the Saturn, famous for its difficulty and its masterclass in sound design.
