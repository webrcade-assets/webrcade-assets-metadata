The initial European release of Sega's hockey franchise. The game uses a mix of 3D environments and pre-rendered player sprites to deliver a fluid and visually consistent experience. It features realistic checks, slap shots, and goalie saves, all presented with a polished arcade-style interface. This version includes the 1995-1996 NHL rosters and offers several league and tournament formats, serving as the foundational hockey title for many European Saturn owners.
