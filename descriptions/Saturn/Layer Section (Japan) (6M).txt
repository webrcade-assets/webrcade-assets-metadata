Known as RayForce in arcades and Galactic Attack in the West, this Taito shooter is a masterpiece of the genre. It features a unique 'lock-on laser' mechanic that allows players to target enemies on a lower plane of depth while shooting down enemies on the main plane. The Saturn port is famous for its 'TATE' mode support, allowing players to rotate their monitors for an authentic arcade vertical screen experience.
