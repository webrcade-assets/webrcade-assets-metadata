Robotica is an atmospheric, corridor-based FPS where players pilot a state-of-the-art 'Deadalus' battle-armor into a sentient skyscraper known as the Wulfrag Tower. The tower's central AI has gone rogue, and players must fight through floor after floor of automated security drones to reach the core. The game is known for its dark, claustrophobic atmosphere, smooth 3D movement, and a minimalist UI that enhances the feeling of being inside a mechanical suit. Each level is procedurally generated, ensuring a different layout for every playthrough.
