Tetris Plus adds a unique 'Quest' mode to the classic block-clearing formula. Players must clear lines to help a small archaeologist character named the Professor reach the bottom of the screen before a spiked ceiling crushes him. The game features various themed stages based on ancient civilizations like Egypt and Atlantis. The European version includes a standard classic mode and a competitive two-player mode. With its charming characters and high-energy music, it provides a fun and frantic twist on the world's most famous puzzle game.
