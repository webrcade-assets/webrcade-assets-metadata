A masterpiece from Sonic Team, NiGHTS into Dreams is a high-flying score-attack game set in a dream world. Players control NiGHTS as they glide through 3D loops, collecting 'blue chips' and 'Paralooping' enemies to clear stages. The game is designed for the Saturn 3D Control Pad, offering fluid, 360-degree analog movement that was revolutionary at the time. The European version captures the game's whimsical atmosphere and soaring orchestral soundtrack, providing an experience that is both relaxing and intensely competitive.
