The Saturn version of Rayman is widely considered the definitive way to play this 2D classic. It features lush, vibrant hand-drawn graphics and an incredible CD soundtrack that far surpasses the 16-bit versions. Rayman must travel through six whimsical worlds to rescue the Electoons and defeat Mr. Dark. The game is famous for its steep difficulty and its imaginative character designs. This European 'M3' version includes localized support for English, French, and German.
