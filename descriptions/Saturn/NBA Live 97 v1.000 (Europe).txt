EA Sports' NBA Live 97 brought a more serious simulation approach to the Saturn. It was the first in the series to use 3D polygonal players, allowing for realistic interactions and diverse shooting animations. The game includes a comprehensive season mode, player trading, and the ability to create custom athletes. The European release is noted for its polished presentation and the depth of its stat tracking, providing a solid alternative for players who preferred the official EA Sports style of simulation.
