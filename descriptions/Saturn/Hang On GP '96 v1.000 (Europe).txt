Known as Hang-On GP in the US and Hang-On GP '95 in Japan, this is the 32-bit evolution of Sega's classic motorcycle racing franchise. The game features multiple 3D tracks and a variety of bikes to choose from. It attempts to blend arcade speed with more realistic bike physics, requiring players to lean into turns and manage their speed carefully to avoid wiping out. The European version features smooth performance and multiple camera angles, including a handle-bar view for maximum immersion.
