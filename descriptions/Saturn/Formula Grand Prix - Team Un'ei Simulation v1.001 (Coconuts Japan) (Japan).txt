A deep and technical Formula One management simulator. Instead of driving the cars, players take on the role of a Team Manager, responsible for everything from hiring drivers and mechanics to developing new parts and managing pit-stop strategies during races. The game features realistic data and requires a high level of strategic thinking to climb the rankings of a full racing season. It is an excellent example of the niche 'management' genre that flourished on the Saturn in Japan.
