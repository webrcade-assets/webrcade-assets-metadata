The Saturn port of Duke Nukem 3D is a technical marvel developed by Lobotomy Software. Instead of using the original Build engine, they rebuilt the game using their custom 'SlaveDriver' engine, allowing for true 3D environments and impressive colored lighting effects that surpassed the original PC version in some aspects. This version includes the full 'Atomic Edition' content and features a unique hidden multiplayer mode that supports the NetLink modem. It remains one of the most fluid and visually impressive first-person shooters on the console.
