A legendary title from Treasure, Guardian Heroes blends traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up action with deep RPG elements and a branching narrative path. Players can choose from multiple characters, each with a massive move list inspired by 2D fighting games. The game features a unique 'three-plane' movement system and massive battles involving dozens of sprites on screen at once. With over 30 possible endings and a chaotic six-player versus mode, it is frequently cited as one of the greatest games in the Saturn's entire library.
