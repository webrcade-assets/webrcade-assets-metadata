The game that revolutionized the light-gun genre by introducing full 3D polygonal environments and enemies. Players act as a police officer clearing out various criminal hideouts, using a 'Lock-on Sight' that changes color to indicate how close an enemy is to firing. This initial Japanese release was a major technical showcase for the Saturn, featuring smooth 3D movement and reactive environments where glass and crates could be destroyed. It remains a foundational title for the system and the genre as a whole.
