A compilation of two of Taito's most beloved arcade classics. Bubble Bobble tasks players with trapping enemies in bubbles across 100 levels, while the sequel, Rainbow Islands, focuses on creating rainbow bridges to climb to the top of vertical stages. This version is prized for its arcade accuracy, featuring the original soundtracks, secret rooms, and branching endings that made the arcade originals legendary.
