The sequel to the cult classic Dragon Force, this title expands the massive real-time tactical battles to include new unit types and a more complex magic system. Players lead armies of up to 200 soldiers in spectacular 2D battles. This specific version includes a comprehensive English fan translation by Verve Fanworks, making the deep political narrative and complex strategy systems accessible to Western players. It is widely considered one of the finest strategy games ever produced for a 32-bit console.
