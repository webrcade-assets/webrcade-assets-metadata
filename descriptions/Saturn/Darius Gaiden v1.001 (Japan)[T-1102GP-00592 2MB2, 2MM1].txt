Widely considered one of the greatest horizontal shooters ever made, Darius Gaiden is famous for its massive robotic fish bosses and its branching level structure. Players control the Silver Hawk fighter and can capture enemy 'mid-bosses' to fight alongside them as drones. The Saturn version is a nearly arcade-perfect port, maintaining the vibrant colors and the incredible, avant-garde soundtrack by Zuntata. This specific Japanese revision includes several minor bug fixes to the boss behavior and scoring system.
