Strahl is a cinematic action game that uses high-quality anime footage to tell its story. Like Dragon's Lair, players must input directional or action commands at precise moments during the animation to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies. The game features a classic fantasy narrative involving seven magical light fragments. This Saturn version is noted for its clean video playback and the quality of its traditional cel-animation. It is a challenging test of memory and reflexes, offering a high-stakes 'playable anime' experience that was a staple of the CD-ROM era.
