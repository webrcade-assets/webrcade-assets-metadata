NBA Jam Extreme moves the classic over-the-top basketball series into a fully 3D polygonal engine. The game retains the signature 'On Fire' mechanics, gravity-defying dunks, and shove-heavy defense of the originals but adds new 'Extreme' moves that are unique to each player. This European release features the iconic voice of Marv Albert and a fast-paced arcade feel. While a departure from the 2D sprites of earlier entries, it remains a high-energy, fun multiplayer experience that emphasizes style over realism.
