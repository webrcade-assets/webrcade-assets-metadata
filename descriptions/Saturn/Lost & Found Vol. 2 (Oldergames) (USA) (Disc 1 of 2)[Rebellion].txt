A unique homebrew/archive release from Oldergames. This disc contains 'Rebellion,' a game that was originally intended for release in the 90s but was cancelled. It is a 2D side-scrolling action-platformer that showcases what indie developers and archivists can achieve on the Saturn hardware. This volume serves as an important piece of 'lost' gaming history, providing players with a look at a title that would have otherwise remained forgotten in a development studio's vault.
