The German-localized version of Kenji Eno's cult classic 'D'. This disc contains the beginning of the cinematic journey, featuring dubbed or subtitled dialogue that brings the story of the Harris family to a German audience. The game's minimalist UI and focus on immersion were revolutionary, using a 'virtual' cinematic camera that moves between pre-rendered scenes as the player interacts with objects and moves through the environments.
