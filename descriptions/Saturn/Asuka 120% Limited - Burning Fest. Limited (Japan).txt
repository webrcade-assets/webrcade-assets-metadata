A cult-classic 2D fighting game developed by Fill-in-Cafe. Set in a high school, clubs (like Chemistry, Biology, and Tennis) battle for budget funding. It is renowned for its fast-paced, combo-heavy gameplay, simple controls, and the ability to 'clash' projectiles. The Saturn version is widely considered the definitive home console release, featuring smoother animation and better balance than the PlayStation version.
