The European multi-language release of Olympic Soccer. This title was one of the first 3D soccer games to feature a diverse range of camera angles and a sophisticated replay system. It offers players the chance to lead their favorite nation through the grueling Olympic qualifying stages and into the finals. The game's engine allows for smooth 360-degree player movement and features a responsive control scheme that rewards tactical passing and well-timed headers. It serves as a solid representation of the mid-90s soccer simulation genre.
