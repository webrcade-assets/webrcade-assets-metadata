An updated follow-up to Koutetsu no Senpuu, Sakusen File features a new set of scenarios and refined gameplay balance. The game includes several 'what-if' missions that allow players to change the outcome of historical battles. The 3D battle engine was polished to include more detailed unit models and smoother transitions. For strategy fans, this title offers even more depth and tactical variety than the original, providing hundreds of hours of high-stakes military simulation that pushes the Saturn's processing power to its limits during the complex AI turns.
