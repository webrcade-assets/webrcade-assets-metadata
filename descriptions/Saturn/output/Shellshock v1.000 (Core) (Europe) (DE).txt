Developed by Core Design (the creators of Tomb Raider), Shellshock is a gritty first-person tank combat game. Players take control of the M1-A1 Abrams tank as part of a mercenary squad. The game features a unique 'gangsta rap' aesthetic and soundtrack, giving it a distinct urban attitude. This German-localized version features translated text and voice work, as players navigate 3D battlefields to destroy enemy fortifications and hardware. The gameplay is fast and mission-based, focusing on heavy artillery destruction and squad-based objectives.
