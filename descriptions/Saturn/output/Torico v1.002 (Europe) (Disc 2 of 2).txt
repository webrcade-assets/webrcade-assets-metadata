The concluding half of the Torico mystery. Fred journeys into the more surreal layers of the world, uncovering the truth behind his past and the nature of the strange realm he inhabits. This disc contains the game's more difficult puzzles and the multiple cinematic endings. The high-quality CD-audio soundtrack and the somber, gothic tone made it a unique cult classic for European Saturn owners, offering a slow-paced and deeply emotional experience compared to traditional action games.
