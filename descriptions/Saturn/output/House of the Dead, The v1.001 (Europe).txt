The home port of Sega’s legendary arcade light gun shooter. Players navigate a zombie-infested mansion, blasting through waves of undead and grotesque bosses. The game is famous for its branching paths—which change based on whether the player rescues civilians—and its fast-paced, visceral combat. While the Saturn version suffers from some graphical compromises compared to the arcade, it remains a highly playable and essential part of the system's light gun library, especially when played with the Virtua Gun.
