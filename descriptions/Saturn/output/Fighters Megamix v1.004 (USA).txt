The North American release of Fighters Megamix. This version refined the balance between the Virtua Fighter and Fighting Vipers characters, ensuring that both playstyles were viable. It remains a must-have for the Saturn, serving as a 'love letter' to Sega fans of the 90s. With over 30 characters to unlock and a wide variety of arenas, it offers more longevity and variety than almost any other fighting game on the console.
