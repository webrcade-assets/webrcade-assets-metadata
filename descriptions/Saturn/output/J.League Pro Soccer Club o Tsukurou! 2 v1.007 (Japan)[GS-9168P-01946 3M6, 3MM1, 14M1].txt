The second installment in Sega’s wildly popular J.League management series. Players act as the owner and manager of a professional Japanese soccer club, handling everything from player trades and contract negotiations to stadium upgrades and ticket pricing. The game features a much more robust database and deeper simulation mechanics than the original, with matches playing out in a 3D engine. It is a highly addictive business and sports hybrid that established the 'Saka-Tsuku' franchise as a mainstay of Japanese gaming.
