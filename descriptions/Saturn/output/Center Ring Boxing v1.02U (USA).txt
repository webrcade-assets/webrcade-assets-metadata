Known in Japan as Victor Boxing, Center Ring Boxing is a fully polygonal 3D sports simulation that attempts to capture the weight and impact of professional prize fighting. Players can create a custom boxer and rise through the ranks in a deep career mode, upgrading attributes like speed, power, and stamina. The combat engine features a unique perspective that gets closer to the action than traditional 2D boxing games, allowing for strategic bobbing, weaving, and counter-punching.
