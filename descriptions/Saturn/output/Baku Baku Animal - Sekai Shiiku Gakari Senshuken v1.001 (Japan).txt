A fast-paced falling-block puzzle game where the objective is to clear your screen by matching animals with their favorite foods. For example, a panda block must be placed next to a bamboo block to clear it. The game features a competitive versus mode where clearing large chains of blocks sends 'garbage' to the opponent's screen. The Japanese version features charming, high-energy voice acting and a humorous story mode following a young girl vying for the title of Master Zookeeper.
