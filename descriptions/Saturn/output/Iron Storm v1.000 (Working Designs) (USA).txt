Known as World Advanced Daisenryaku in Japan, Iron Storm is a deep hex-based tactical wargame set during World War II. Players can choose to lead the forces of the US, Germany, or Japan through a series of historical and 'what-if' scenarios. The game is famous for its 3D battle animations that trigger when units engage, which was a major visual upgrade for the genre at the time. The Working Designs localization is highly regarded for its detailed manual and the polish it brought to this technical simulation.
