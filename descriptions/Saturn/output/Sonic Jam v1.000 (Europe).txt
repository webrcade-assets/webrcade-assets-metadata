Sonic Jam is a premium compilation featuring pixel-perfect ports of Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles. Unlike other collections, these versions allow for customized difficulty and fixed physics bugs. The centerpiece of the Saturn release is 'Sonic World,' a fully 3D environment where players can control Sonic in an open-world setting. This mode acts as a museum, containing a cinema for viewing commercials and animations, a music house, and a gallery of historical artwork. It is widely considered the best retro compilation of the 32-bit era.
