Based on the popular anime and manga series (known as 'Those Who Hunt Elves'), this RPG follows a trio of humans and their Type 74 tank as they travel through a fantasy world searching for elf fragments to return home. The game features a humorous narrative and a turn-based combat system where the tank plays a central role. Disc 1 covers the beginning of their quest, featuring high-quality anime cutscenes and a unique mechanic where you must 'search' elves for magical tattoos.
