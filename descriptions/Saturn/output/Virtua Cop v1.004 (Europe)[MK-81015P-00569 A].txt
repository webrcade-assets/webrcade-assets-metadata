An alternate European revision of Virtua Cop. This version features several minor bug fixes and data optimizations for the PAL hardware. The core gameplay remains the definitive 3D light-gun experience of the mid-90s, offering a high level of challenge and a focus on high-score chasing. Its use of the 'Active Sight' system made it accessible to new players while offering deep strategic possibilities for experts trying to maximize their efficiency and minimize civilian casualties.
