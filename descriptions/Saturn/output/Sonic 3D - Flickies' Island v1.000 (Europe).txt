Sonic 3D (known as Sonic 3D Blast in the US) takes the Blue Blur into an isometric 3D perspective. Players must explore stages to find and rescue Flickies—birds that have been turned into robots by Dr. Robotnik. The Saturn version is the definitive edition of the game, featuring vastly improved 32-bit graphics with transparency effects, a completely new and atmospheric Redbook CD soundtrack by Richard Jacques, and impressive fully-polygonal 3D bonus stages that showcase the system's processing power.
