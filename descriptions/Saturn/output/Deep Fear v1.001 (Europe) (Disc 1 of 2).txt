Deep Fear is a survival horror game set in a deep-sea research facility called 'The Big Table.' Players control rescue operative John Mayor as he battles mutated creatures after a mysterious meteor crash. The game innovates on the Resident Evil formula by allowing players to move while aiming and introducing an air-management system where certain rooms can run out of oxygen. Disc 1 sets the stage for the isolation and tension, focusing on exploration and the initial outbreak.
