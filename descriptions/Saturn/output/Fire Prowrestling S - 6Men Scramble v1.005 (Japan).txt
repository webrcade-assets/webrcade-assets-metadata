Fire Pro Wrestling S is widely considered one of the greatest 2D wrestling games ever made. It features a massive roster of characters clearly inspired by real-world legends, a deep edit mode for creating custom wrestlers, and a timing-based grapple system that rewards skill over button-mashing. The '6-Men Scramble' title refers to the chaotic multi-man tag matches and Battle Royales that the Saturn hardware handles with ease. Its depth and customization options have given it a legendary status among wrestling fans.
