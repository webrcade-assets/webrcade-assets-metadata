The Saturn remake of the Sega CD title 'Mansion of Hidden Souls.' This version features significantly upgraded 3D graphics and smoother transitions between rooms. Players explore a surreal mansion filled with butterflies that contain the souls of trapped humans. The game is a moody, first-person adventure focused on solving environmental puzzles and uncovering the tragic narrative of the mansion's master. This Japanese version is prized for its atmospheric lighting and improved audio, providing a more immersive 'ghost story' experience than the 16-bit original.
