Based on the first three films in the Alien franchise, Alien Trilogy casts players as Ellen Ripley as she cleanses the LV-426 colony, the Fiorina 161 prison, and a crashed derelict ship. The game is a dark, atmospheric FPS where players must manage limited ammunition and health while fending off Facehuggers, Chestbursters, and various evolutions of Xenomorphs. The Saturn version features impressive lighting effects that heighten the sense of claustrophobia and dread.
