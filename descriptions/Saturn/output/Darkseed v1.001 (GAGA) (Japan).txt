Darkseed is a psychological horror adventure game famous for its art design by H.R. Giger (the designer of the Alien Xenomorph). Players control Mike Dawson, who discovers a portal to a 'Dark World' after moving into a new home. The game features a real-time clock, requiring players to be in certain places at certain times to solve puzzles. The Japanese Saturn release features localized text and a high-quality presentation that preserves the unsettling, biomechanical atmosphere of the original PC release.
