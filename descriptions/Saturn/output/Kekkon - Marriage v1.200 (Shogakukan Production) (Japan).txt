A unique simulation game focused on the theme of finding a marriage partner. Players interact with several different female characters, participating in dates and social events to determine compatibility. Unlike younger-skewing dating sims, Kekkon focuses on more mature themes of life planning and long-term commitment. It features high-quality 2D character designs and a heavy emphasis on dialogue choices. The game's structure is influenced by popular 'trendy dramas' of 90s Japanese television, offering a slice-of-life experience.
