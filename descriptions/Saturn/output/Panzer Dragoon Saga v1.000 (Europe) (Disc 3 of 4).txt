In the third chapter of this epic saga, the conflict between Edge and the Imperial forces reaches a boiling point. This disc contains some of the game's most iconic boss encounters and the exploration of the massive 'Imperial Capital' zone. Players continue to evolve their dragon through several specialized forms (Attack, Defense, Agility, and Spiritual) to handle increasingly difficult tactical battles. The story begins to converge on the true origin of the dragon-riding warriors.
