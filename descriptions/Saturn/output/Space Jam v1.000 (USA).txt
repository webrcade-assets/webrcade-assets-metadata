Based on the 1996 film, Space Jam features 2-on-2 or 3-on-3 basketball gameplay between the Tune Squad and the Monstars. The game uses digitized sprites of characters like Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan, set against pre-rendered courts. It includes various Looney Tunes-style power-ups and mini-games based on scenes from the movie. The gameplay is fast and arcade-oriented, focusing on easy-to-pull-off dunks and humorous animations. It captures the lighthearted energy of the film and is a fun multiplayer title for fans of the franchise.
