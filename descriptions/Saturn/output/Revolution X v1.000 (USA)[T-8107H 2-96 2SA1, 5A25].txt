An over-the-top arcade shooter starring the band Aerosmith. Set in a dystopian future where music is banned, players must use a mounted gun to fire CDs at the 'New Order Nation' to rescue the band. The game features digital video of the band members and a high-energy soundtrack including hits like 'Eat the Rich.' This US version captures the frantic, quarter-munching action of the original cabinet, offering a loud and rebellious piece of 90s arcade culture.
