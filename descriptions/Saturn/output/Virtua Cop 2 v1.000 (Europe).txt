The legendary sequel to Sega’s premier light-gun shooter. Virtua Cop 2 expands the action with branching paths, faster gameplay, and even more detailed 3D environments. Players take control of detectives Rage and Smarty as they chase the E.V.I.L. Syndicate through car chases and high-stakes bank robberies. The European version is a perfect arcade conversion, supporting the Virtua Gun for high-precision shooting. It remains one of the most iconic and replayable titles in the light-gun genre, known for its rhythmic 'Justice Shot' system.
