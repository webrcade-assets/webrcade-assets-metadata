The second disc of the Street Fighter Collection features Street Fighter Alpha 2 Dash (known as Alpha 2 Gold in the West). This is an enhanced version of Alpha 2, featuring Cammy as a playable character in Versus and Training modes, as well as several balance adjustments for the main roster. The Saturn version is often cited as superior to other console ports due to its use of the internal hardware to manage the large animation frames, resulting in a more fluid and arcade-accurate presentation of one of the series' most beloved entries.
