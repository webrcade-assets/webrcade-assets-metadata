The debut title from the legendary developer Cave, DonPachi revolutionized the 'bullet hell' subgenre. Players choose from three different ships and blast their way through five stages of intense mechanical warfare. The game introduced the 'chain' scoring system and the powerful laser attack that slows movement for more precise dodging. The Saturn version is a very faithful port, including a 'Saturn Mode' with adjusted difficulty and a high-score table that persists between sessions.
