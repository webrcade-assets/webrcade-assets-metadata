A home port of the high-speed Model 2 arcade game, Sega Touring Car focuses on the world of international GT racing. Unlike Sega Rally, this title features heavy, sensitive handling and extremely high speeds on paved circuits. The US version includes a 'Saturn Mode' with car tuning and a variety of licensed touring cars from Opel, Alfa Romeo, and Toyota. The game is noted for its intense techno soundtrack and its focus on precision driving, requiring players to learn the exact braking points for every corner to succeed.
