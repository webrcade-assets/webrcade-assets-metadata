A must-have for shooter fans, this compilation includes arcade-perfect ports of the original Gradius and its legendary sequel, Gradius II: GOFER no Yabou. The Saturn version includes various options for sound (arcade or arranged) and provides an 'intro' movie for both titles. Gradius is famous for its iconic 'Power Meter' system, allowing players to strategically choose their upgrades as they battle through organic and mechanical alien stages. This release serves as a definitive historical document of the series' foundational years.
