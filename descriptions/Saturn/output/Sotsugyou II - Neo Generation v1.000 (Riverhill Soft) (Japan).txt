The sequel to the popular 'Graduation' teacher simulation. Players take the role of a teacher at a prestigious girls' high school, tasked with guiding five unique students through their final year. The gameplay involves managing the students' weekly schedules, balancing their academic performance, physical health, and social behavior. The Saturn version features high-quality 2D art, full voice acting, and multiple endings based on how each girl’s life turns out after graduation. It is a classic example of the 'raising sim' genre that was highly successful in Japan.
