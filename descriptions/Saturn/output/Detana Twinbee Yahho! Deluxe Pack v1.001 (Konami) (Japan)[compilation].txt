A high-value compilation containing two of Konami's 'cute 'em up' classics: Detana!! TwinBee and TwinBee Yahho!. These games feature vibrant, colorful graphics and a unique power-up system involving juggling bells to change their color. The Saturn versions are pixel-perfect arcade ports with added features like a CGI intro and high-quality CD audio. Both games support two-player simultaneous play, which is the intended way to experience the series' chaotic and lighthearted action.
