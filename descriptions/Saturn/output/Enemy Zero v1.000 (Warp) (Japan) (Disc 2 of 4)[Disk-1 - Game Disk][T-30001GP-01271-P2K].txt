The first main gameplay disc for Enemy Zero. Here, the tension ramps up as players must navigate the corridors of the Aki, managing a battery-powered energy gun with extremely limited shots. Because the enemies cannot be seen, the gameplay becomes a tense exercise in auditory spatial awareness. This disc features the first major set of puzzles and the initial terrifying encounters with the station's invisible inhabitants, presented in high-quality FMV transitions.
