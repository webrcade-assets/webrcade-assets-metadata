An arcade port of the side-scrolling beat 'em up based on the film. Players choose between Batman and Robin, fighting through waves of thugs across Gotham City. The game features digitized actors and an exaggerated combat system where special moves result in massive, multi-hit combos and cartoonish gadgets. This specific version features a Portuguese fan translation by Monkey's Traduções, making the story and UI accessible to Lusophone players.
