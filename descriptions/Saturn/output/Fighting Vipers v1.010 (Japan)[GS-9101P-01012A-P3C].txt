The Japanese revision of the arcade hit. This version includes several balance tweaks and a wealth of Saturn-exclusive content, including a training mode and a character portrait gallery. The roster features memorable characters like the skater Picky and the mysterious guitarist Bahn. The game’s fast-paced, high-impact combat was a perfect fit for the Saturn’s hardware, showcasing large character models and smooth, 60FPS animation that stood out in the early 3D era.
