Known as PowerSlave in North America and 1999: Resurrection in Japan, Exhumed is a premier FPS set in ancient Egypt. Players battle alien invaders and mummified horrors using a blend of conventional and magical weaponry. It is famous for its Metroidvania-style progression, where players earn new abilities (like hovering or breathing underwater) that allow them to access new areas in previously completed levels. The Saturn version is highly regarded for its advanced 3D lighting and fluid 30FPS performance.
