FIFA 97 was the first in the series to move away from 2D sprites toward a fully polygonal 3D engine. It introduced motion-captured animations provided by David Ginola, adding a significant layer of realism to player movements. The game also featured a new 'Indoor Soccer' mode, which offered faster, more arcade-like gameplay. This European release features multi-language support and was a major step forward for the franchise's presentation and physics engine.
