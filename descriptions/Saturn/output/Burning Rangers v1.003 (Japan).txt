A futuristic action game from Sonic Team where players act as elite space-firefighters. The primary goal is to extinguish fires and rescue trapped civilians in rapidly deteriorating environments. Because the levels are filled with smoke and debris, the game uses a revolutionary 'Voice Navigation System' to guide players through the corridors. The Japanese version features an iconic J-Pop theme song and high-quality anime cutscenes that tell the story of the rookie rangers' growth.
