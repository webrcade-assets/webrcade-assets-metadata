The GDI disc for the European multi-language release of Command & Conquer. This port of the PC masterpiece was highly praised for retaining almost all the features of the original, including the iconic score by Frank Klepacki. Players must build bases, manage power consumption, and harvest Tiberium to fund a high-tech army. The GDI missions emphasize conventional military strength, utilizing heavy tanks, airstrikes, and the powerful Ion Cannon to secure Europe and Africa from Nod influence.
