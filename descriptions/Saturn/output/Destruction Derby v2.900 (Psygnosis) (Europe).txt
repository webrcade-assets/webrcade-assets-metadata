A port of the popular smash-up racer, Destruction Derby tasks players with wrecking their opponents' cars while competing on various tracks and arenas. Points are awarded for spinning out other cars and causing damage, rather than just crossing the finish line first. The game features a unique damage model where the car's performance degrades as it takes hits. The European version on Saturn is noted for its smooth performance and the inclusion of various derby-style play modes.
