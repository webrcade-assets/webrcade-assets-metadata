A home port of the Sega AM3 arcade game, Last Bronx is a 3D weapon-based fighter set in a realistic, gritty version of Tokyo. Characters use weapons ranging from nunchucks and batons to hammers and staffs. The game is notable for its 'high-res' graphics and 60FPS animation, which was a major selling point for the Saturn. The European release includes the 'Arcade' and 'Saturn' modes, providing a deep fighting experience with motion-captured moves and highly detailed urban arenas.
