Also known as Alone in the Dark 2, this title follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby as he searches for a kidnapped girl in the sinister 'Hell's Kitchen' mansion. Unlike the first game's Lovecraftian themes, this entry focuses on undead pirates and voodoo magic. The gameplay blends 3D character models with pre-rendered backgrounds, emphasizing puzzle-solving, item management, and high-stakes combat against supernatural foes.
