The home debut of Team Ninja's flagship fighting series. Dead or Alive on Saturn is notable for being one of the few games to utilize the console's high-resolution mode, resulting in exceptionally clean character models. It introduced the 'Hold' system, allowing players to counter incoming strikes, and the 'Danger Zone' perimeter which causes explosive damage to fighters who are knocked out of bounds. This Saturn version is often preferred by fans for its unique 2D backgrounds which offer a different aesthetic than the later PlayStation port.
