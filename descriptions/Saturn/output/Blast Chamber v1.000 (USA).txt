A high-stakes puzzle-action game where gravity is your greatest ally and enemy. Players must navigate 60 different 'chambers,' each a cube that can be flipped 90 degrees in any direction. Success requires careful platforming and quick thinking as you race against a literal exploding heart. The US version is known for its intense difficulty and creative level designs that utilize the 3D rotating mechanic to the fullest.
