A 'cute 'em up' vertical shooter from Psikyo. Players select from five eccentric characters, including a witch on a broom and a robot, as they search for the fragments of a magical mirror. The game is known for its fast bullets and multi-phase bosses that transform into surprising forms. The Saturn version is a high-quality port that includes a 'TATE' mode for vertical monitors and exclusive voice acting for the character-driven story sequences. Its colorful art style and tight hitboxes make it a favorite for shmup enthusiasts.
