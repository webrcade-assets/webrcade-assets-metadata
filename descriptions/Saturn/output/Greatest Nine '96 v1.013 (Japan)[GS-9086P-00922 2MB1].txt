The 1996 installment of Sega's premier baseball franchise in Japan. The game features the official NPB (Nippon Professional Baseball) license, allowing players to use real teams and players from that season. It offers a 3D-perspective pitching and hitting system that was highly influential for the genre. The game is known for its detailed statistics, various stadium recreations, and the high-energy commentary that captures the atmosphere of a live Japanese baseball broadcast. It remains a solid example of the Saturn's strength in sports simulation.
