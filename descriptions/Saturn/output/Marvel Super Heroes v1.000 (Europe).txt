A spectacular 2D fighter from Capcom featuring iconic Marvel characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Iron Man. The game introduces the 'Infinity Gem' system, where players can collect and use gems (Power, Time, Space, etc.) to gain temporary buffs in battle. The Saturn version is highly regarded as the best home port of its time, featuring massive, fluidly animated sprites and an epic boss battle against Thanos. It is a vibrant, high-energy fighter that perfectly captures the comic book aesthetic.
