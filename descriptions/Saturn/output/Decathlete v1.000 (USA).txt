Known as Athlete Kings in Europe, the North American release of Decathlete is an arcade sports classic. The game's appeal lies in its accessibility and competitive multiplayer, as players button-mash to build speed and time their button presses for jumps and throws. It features a unique 'Trial' mode where players can practice individual events to perfect their timing. The game’s colorful, slightly exaggerated character designs give it a personality distinct from more serious sports simulations.
