An innovative 'Soccer RPG' published by Enix. Instead of direct control, players act as the manager of the Japanese National Team, guiding players through training and narrative-driven growth. Matches are played out using a command-based system similar to Captain Tsubasa, where choices lead to cinematic animations. It features a deep story campaign and extensive player statistics. This title is a unique hybrid that combines the tactical depth of a management sim with the character-driven engagement of a traditional JRPG.
