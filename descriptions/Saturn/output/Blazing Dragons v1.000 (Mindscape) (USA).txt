A satirical take on classic fairy tales and knightly tropes. As Flicker, players solve inventory-based puzzles and engage in various minigames—including a dragon-themed version of arcade classics—to prove their worth. The game is packed with celebrity voice talent and features a branching dialogue system that rewards players for exploration. It is often cited as one of the best traditional adventure games available on the Sega Saturn.
