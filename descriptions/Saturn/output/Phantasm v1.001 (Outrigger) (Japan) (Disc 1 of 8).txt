Known in the West as Phantasmagoria, this is a massive 8-disc FMV horror epic from Roberta Williams. Players control Adrienne Delaney, who moves into a remote mansion with her husband only to find it haunted by a dark history of occultism. Disc 1 introduces the characters and the sprawling, highly detailed house. The game uses live-action actors against pre-rendered CG sets, aiming to provide a 'playable movie' experience that was incredibly ambitious for the mid-90s.
