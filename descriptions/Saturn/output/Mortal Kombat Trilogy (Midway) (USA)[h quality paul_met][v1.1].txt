Mortal Kombat Trilogy is the ultimate 32-bit compilation, bringing together almost every character and stage from the first three games. This 'High Quality' fan-patched version by Paul_Met addresses several technical shortcomings of the original Saturn release, including optimized loading times and improved sound quality. Players can choose from over 30 characters, including the return of the classic ninjas and boss characters like Goro and Shao Kahn, all featuring their iconic Fatalities and Brutalities.
