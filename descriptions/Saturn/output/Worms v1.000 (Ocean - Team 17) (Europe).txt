Worms is a high-energy, turn-based tactical game where players control a team of four worms across various randomly generated landscapes. The goal is to use a massive arsenal of weapons—ranging from bazookas and grenades to exploding sheep and holy hand grenades—to eliminate the opposing teams. The game is famous for its dark humor and its highly destructible environments. The European version on Saturn is noted for its crisp 2D graphics and its incredible multiplayer longevity, making it one of the best party games available for the console.
