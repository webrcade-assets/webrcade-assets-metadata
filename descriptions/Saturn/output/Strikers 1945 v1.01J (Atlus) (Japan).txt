A premier vertical shmup from Psikyo, Strikers 1945 features an alternate-history World War II setting where players pilot legendary planes like the P-38 Lightning and the Spitfire. The twist is that enemy hardware frequently transforms into massive robotic tanks and walkers. The Saturn version is a high-quality arcade port, featuring the series' signature 'fast-bullet' gameplay and multi-phase bosses. It includes a 'TATE' mode for vertical monitor support and features a high-fidelity soundtrack that captures the military-heroic tone of the action.
