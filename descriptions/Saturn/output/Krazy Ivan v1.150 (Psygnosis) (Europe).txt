In Krazy Ivan, players pilot a massive Russian mech to defend the Earth against an alien invasion. The game is a fast-paced, first-person mech shooter where players stomp through 3D environments like Russia, Japan, and the USA. Unlike more complex sims, Ivan is pure arcade action—emphasizing rapid-fire destruction and taking down screen-filling bosses. The European version features high-energy techno music and atmospheric FMV cutscenes that establish the game's gritty, futuristic setting.
