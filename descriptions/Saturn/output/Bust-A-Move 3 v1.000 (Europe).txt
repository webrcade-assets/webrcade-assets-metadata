The third entry in the series introduces new mechanics like 'rainbow bubbles' and 'gravity bubbles' that change how the board is cleared. It features a significantly larger roster of characters, each with their own unique patterns for sending garbage bubbles in versus mode. This version also includes a robust level editor, allowing players to create their own bubble layouts and share them via memory back-up, significantly increasing the game's replay value.
