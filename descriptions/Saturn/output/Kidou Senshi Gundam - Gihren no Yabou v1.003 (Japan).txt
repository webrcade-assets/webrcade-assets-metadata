One of the most ambitious Gundam games ever made, Gihren's Ambition is a grand strategy title where players take command of either the Earth Federation or the Principality of Zeon during the One Year War. Gameplay involves resource management, technological research, and massive hex-based tactical battles. The game is famous for its 'What If' scenarios—such as what would happen if Garma Zabi survived—allowing players to rewrite Gundam history. Its deep systems and massive scope made it a definitive title for strategy fans.
