Part of the Strike series from Electronic Arts, Soviet Strike moves the isometric helicopter action into the 32-bit era. Players pilot a Super Apache across massive 3D landscapes in the former Soviet Union to stop a rogue general. The game features complex missions that require careful resource management—players must track their fuel, armor, and ammunition while identifying targets. The European version includes high-quality FMV news reports that provide a realistic, cinematic backdrop to the tactical military operations.
