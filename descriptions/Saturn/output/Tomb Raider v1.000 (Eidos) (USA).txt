The North American release of the original Tomb Raider. This version pioneered the 3rd-person 'tank control' exploration style that would define the genre for years. Players must guide Lara through complex 3D environments, finding artifacts and navigating dangerous traps. The Saturn version is noted for its impressive draw distance for the time and its use of the console's VDP processors to handle the complex 3D geometry of the ancient ruins. It remains a foundational title in the history of 3D gaming.
