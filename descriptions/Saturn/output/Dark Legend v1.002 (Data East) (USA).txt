Known as Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! in Japan, Dark Legend is a 2D fighter featuring characters from Data East's Fighter's History series. It features a unique 'weak point' system where characters can be stunned more easily if they are hit repeatedly in a specific location (like a headband or chest guard). The game boasts large, detailed sprites and fluid animation, with the Saturn version benefiting from fast loading times and a high-quality arranged soundtrack.
