A technical triumph for Lobotomy Software, Quake on the Saturn uses a custom 3D engine to bring id Software's masterpiece to home consoles. While it lacks the multiplayer of the PC original, it features an exclusive 'Deathmatch' mode against bots and several exclusive missions. The game is praised for its dark, industrial atmosphere and its impressive lighting effects that successfully mimic the PC experience. The Saturn's sound hardware delivers the iconic Trent Reznor soundtrack with haunting clarity.
