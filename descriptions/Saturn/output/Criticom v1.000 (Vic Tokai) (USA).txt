Criticom is an early 3D fighting game that features a roster of alien warriors competing for a powerful relic known as the 'Limen.' The game utilizes a high-poly character aesthetic and slow-paced, methodical combat that rewards timing and knowledge of the character's move lists. It features an interesting RPG-style progression system in the single-player mode where players can upgrade their fighter's stats and unlock new moves. The atmospheric sci-fi backgrounds and unique character designs provide a distinct, if experimental, 3D fighting experience.
