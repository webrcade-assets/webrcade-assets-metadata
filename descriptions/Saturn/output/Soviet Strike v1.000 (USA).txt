The North American release of Soviet Strike is an intense, mission-based shooter that demands tactical thinking. The game engine allows for impressive terrain destruction and features hundreds of active units on the map simultaneously. The story is told through a gritty, political thriller lens using digitized video and professional voice acting. The US version is praised for its deep gameplay loop where every decision—from which fuel drum to pick up to which radar station to destroy first—has a direct impact on the success of the mission.
