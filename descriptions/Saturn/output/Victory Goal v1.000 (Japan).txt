A landmark early Saturn sports title, Victory Goal was Sega's primary soccer offering at launch. It focuses on the Japanese J.League and features all the official teams and players of the era. The game pioneered the 'Virtual Stadium' camera system, which allowed for dynamic 3D movements across a flat-textured field. For Japanese fans, it was the first time professional soccer was presented with such high fidelity at home, featuring authentic team chants and a high-resolution interface that set the bar for the system's early years.
