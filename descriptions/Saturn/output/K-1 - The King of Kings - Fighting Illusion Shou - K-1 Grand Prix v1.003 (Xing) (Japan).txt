A realistic kickboxing simulation based on the famous K-1 Grand Prix tournament. Unlike traditional fighting games, K-1 emphasizes stamina management, realistic damage, and authentic martial arts techniques. Players can choose from legendary real-world fighters like Andy Hug and Peter Aerts. The game features polygonal fighters in a 3D ring, with a focus on tactical strikes and defensive positioning. The Saturn version is noted for its high-quality digitized video of real K-1 events and a deep training mode.
