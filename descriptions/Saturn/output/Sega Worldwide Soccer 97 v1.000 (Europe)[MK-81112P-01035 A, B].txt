The follow-up to Victory Goal, Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was a major leap forward for sports games on the system. It moved to a fully 3D environment with high-resolution player sprites that provided an incredibly smooth visual experience. The game features 48 international teams and allows for deep customization of player names and stats. The European version was a massive hit, praised for its intuitive controls and the satisfying 'weight' of the ball, setting a new standard for soccer simulations on home consoles.
