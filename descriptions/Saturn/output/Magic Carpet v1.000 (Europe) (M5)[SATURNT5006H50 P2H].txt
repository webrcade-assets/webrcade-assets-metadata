Developed by Bullfrog, Magic Carpet is a unique 3D flight action game where you play as a wizard on a magic carpet. You must collect mana from defeated monsters and store it in your castle while battling rival wizards. The game features impressive terrain deformation—where spells can create craters or mountains—and a huge variety of mythical creatures. This European multi-language release captures the game's surreal atmosphere and its innovative blend of first-person shooting and light real-time strategy.
