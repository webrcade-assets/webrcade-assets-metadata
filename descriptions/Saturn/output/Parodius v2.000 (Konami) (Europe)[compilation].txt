The European release of Konami's 'Gokujou Parodius Da! Deluxe Pack.' This compilation brings the colorful and absurd world of Parodius to the West, featuring pixel-perfect ports of the original arcade hits. Players can control iconic characters like Vic Viper, TwinBee, and Pentarou the Penguin through surreal stages filled with dancing pandas and giant cats. It is a masterclass in 2D sprite-work and remains one of the most polished and humorous shmup experiences on the platform.
