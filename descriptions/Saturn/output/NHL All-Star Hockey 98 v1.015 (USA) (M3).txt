Sega's own internal hockey simulation, NHL All-Star Hockey 98, features a high-resolution engine that focuses on arcade-style speed and accessibility. It includes the full NHL license and features several international teams. The game uses a 'behind-the-player' camera that emphasizes the speed of the action. This US version includes multi-language support and is noted for its easy-to-learn controls, making it a great pick for casual hockey fans who want a faster game than the more simulation-heavy EA titles.
