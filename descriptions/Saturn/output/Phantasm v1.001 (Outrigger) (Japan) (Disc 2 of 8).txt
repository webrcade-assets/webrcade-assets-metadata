The horror begins to manifest on the second disc of this Japanese localized version. Adrienne begins to witness strange phenomena and finds hidden passages within the estate. The Japanese release is notable for its localization efforts, attempting to bring the gritty, adult-oriented narrative to a regional audience. Gameplay focuses on item-based puzzles and exploration, with the narrative slowly building tension through increasingly disturbing FMV sequences.
