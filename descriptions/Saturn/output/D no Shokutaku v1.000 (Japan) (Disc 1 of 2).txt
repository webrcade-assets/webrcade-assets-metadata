The original Japanese release of the groundbreaking horror title 'D'. Players control Laura Harris as she enters a hospital that has transformed into a bizarre castle to find her father, who has committed a mass murder. Disc 1 introduces the player to the game's core mechanics: a first-person perspective with limited movement and a strict two-hour time limit to complete the entire story. The game relies heavily on atmospheric tension and high-quality CG visuals to create a sense of dread.
