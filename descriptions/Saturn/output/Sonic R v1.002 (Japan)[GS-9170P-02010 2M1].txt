The Japanese revision of Sonic R. This version includes several minor bug fixes and optimizations over the initial Western releases. The game remains a technical marvel for the Saturn, utilizing a unique transparency technique to handle the 3D environments. It features a robust time-attack mode and a split-screen two-player mode. This release captures the peak of Sonic Team's 90s aesthetic, blending high-speed arcade racing with a cheerful, pop-infused presentation that appealed greatly to the Japanese domestic market.
