The final disc of Kakyuusei, containing the winter months and the multiple 'confession' endings. Success requires having built a high enough affinity with a specific girl while maintaining the necessary personal statistics. This disc resolves the various character arcs and provides a sentimental conclusion to the high school journey. Because of its massive script and hundreds of unique CG images, the game required three discs, making it one of the largest visual novels on the system.
