The third main installment in the Puyo Puyo series, 'Sun' introduces 'Sun Puyos' that appear after a chain offset. Clearing these provides extra damage to the opponent, adding a new layer of strategy to the traditional gameplay. The Saturn version is noted for its vibrant 2D artwork and hilarious anime-style cutscenes. It supports high-speed competitive play and features a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique personality and background music.
