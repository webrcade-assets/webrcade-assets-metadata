A unique genre-blending title by Raizing that combines a vertical shoot-'em-up with a racing game. Players choose one of several fantasy characters and race against opponents through bullet-filled stages. Holding the fire button slows you down but increases firepower, creating a risk/reward dynamic between destroying enemies and maintaining speed to finish the race in first place.
