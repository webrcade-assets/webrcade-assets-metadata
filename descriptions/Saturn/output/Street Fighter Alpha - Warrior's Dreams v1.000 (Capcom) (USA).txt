The first entry in the Alpha sub-series, Warrior's Dreams resets the timeline and introduces a vibrant new art style inspired by anime. The game features the 'Super Combo' system and 'Alpha Counters,' adding significant depth to the classic 2D combat. This North American release is a highly accurate arcade port, featuring a roster that blends Street Fighter II veterans with characters from Final Fight (like Guy and Sodom). The Saturn version is praised for its responsive controls and its faithful reproduction of the arcade's sound and visual effects.
