Chaos Control is a cinematic FMV-based rail shooter where players pilot a fighter craft to repel an alien invasion across Manhattan and into deep space. The game uses high-quality pre-rendered CG video backdrops, giving players the feeling of flying through a sci-fi movie. Success requires fast reflexes to target enemy ships and projectiles as they fly across the pre-determined path. The Saturn version is noted for its smooth video playback and responsive cursor movement, which was a significant improvement over contemporary FMV titles.
