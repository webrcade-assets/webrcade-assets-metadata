A unique and experimental action RPG that utilizes digitized photographs for its characters and environments, creating a distinct 'real-life' aesthetic. Players explore a randomly generated world to rescue a princess from an evil demon. The game features a 3D perspective and a weight-based equipment system that affects player movement. This Japanese version is noted for its atmospheric sound design and its role as a remake of the classic Hydlide series. It offers a unique, if polarizing, visual experience that stands out in the Saturn's RPG library.
