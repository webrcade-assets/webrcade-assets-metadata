The Saturn port of the legendary fighting sequel. Mortal Kombat II features a significantly expanded roster, including Kitana, Mileena, and Kung Lao, along with the series' iconic Fatalities, Babalities, and Friendships. The Saturn version is highly regarded for its large, clear sprites and high-quality CD audio. It is a very faithful translation of the arcade original, maintaining the dark atmosphere and fast-paced, high-impact combat that made the series a cultural phenomenon in the 90s.
