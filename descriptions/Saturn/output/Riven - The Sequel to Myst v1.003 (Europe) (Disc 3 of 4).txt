The third disc of Riven leads players into the heart of Gehn's laboratory and the rotating room puzzles. The narrative depth increases here, as players find journals and artifacts that explain the collapse of the world and the conflict between father and son. The game’s environmental storytelling is considered a high-water mark for the genre, with every object in the 3D space potentially serving as a clue for a larger, interconnected logical machine.
