Based on the popular Japanese horror film and book series ('School Ghost Stories'), this title is an interactive adventure where players explore a haunted school at night. The game uses FMV and high-quality photography to tell various ghost stories, requiring players to make choices that lead to different outcomes. It captures the 'urban legend' horror vibe that was popular in Japan during the 90s and is a unique piece of cultural interactive media for the system.
