A dark, ultra-violent top-down shooter featuring six bizarre anti-heroes escaping from a brutal prison. Loaded is famous for its gritty aesthetic, destructible environments, and a blood-soaked art style inspired by adult comic books. The gameplay is fast-paced, multi-directional shooting across sprawling, maze-like levels. The European release features a hard-hitting soundtrack by Pop Will Eat Itself and supports multi-player co-op, making it a favorite for fans of chaotic, arcade-style carnage.
