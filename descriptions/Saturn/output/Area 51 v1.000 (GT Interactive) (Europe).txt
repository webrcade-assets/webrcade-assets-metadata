Area 51 is a port of the popular arcade light-gun game where players act as a member of a specialized tactical team sent to clear a secret government facility of an alien infestation. The game uses digitized sprites and pre-rendered environments to create a cinematic shooting experience. Players must blast through waves of 'Kronn' aliens and infected zombies while avoiding civilian casualties and hitting power-ups to upgrade their weaponry to rapid-fire or shotgun modes.
