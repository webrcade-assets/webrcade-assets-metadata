College Slam is a spin-off of the popular NBA Jam series, bringing high-flying, arcade-style basketball to the collegiate level. It features over 40 real college teams and emphasizes over-the-top dunks, shove-heavy defense, and the series' iconic 'On Fire' mechanic where players gain unlimited turbo and increased accuracy. The game includes specific college-themed modes like the Tournament and a 'Season' mode, all presented with the fast-paced, high-scoring commentary that made Acclaim's basketball games famous.
