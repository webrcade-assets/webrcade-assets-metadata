Shockwave Assault combines high-speed 3D flight combat with cinematic FMV storytelling. Players pilot the F-177 'Shockwave' fighter to repel an alien invasion across the globe, from the Egyptian desert to the surface of the moon. The game features long, mission-based stages where players must destroy enemy structures and aerial forces while managing their fuel and shield levels. The European release includes both the original game and its 'Operation Jumpgate' expansion, offering a vast amount of aerial combat action and high-quality sci-fi cinema.
