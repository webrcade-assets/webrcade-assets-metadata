Three Dirty Dwarves is a highly stylized 2D brawler with a unique premise: three dwarves are summoned to the 'real world' by kids playing a tabletop RPG to fight off corporate suits and mutated freaks. Each dwarf (Greg, Cletus, and Tac) has distinct weapons and abilities, and players can switch between them on the fly. The game features hand-drawn animation that looks like a high-quality 90s cartoon and emphasizes cooperative-style tactics even in single-player mode, as the dwarves can perform team-up attacks.
