Known in Europe as Dragon Ball Z: The Legend, this game moves away from traditional one-on-one fighting in favor of massive team-based battles. Up to three characters can fight simultaneously on each side in large 3D arenas. The objective is to push the 'Power Balance' meter in your favor by landing attacks, which then triggers a cinematic 'Super Attack' to deal damage to the opponent's life bar. It is praised for its faithful recreation of the anime's chaotic, high-speed combat style.
