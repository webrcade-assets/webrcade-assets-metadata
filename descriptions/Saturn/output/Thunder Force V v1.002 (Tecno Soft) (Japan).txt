The fifth entry in the legendary shmup series, Thunder Force V transitions the franchise into 3D while maintaining its signature fast-paced horizontal gameplay. Players pilot the Gauntlet craft, utilizing the 'CRAW' weapon system to switch between various firing patterns. The game is famous for its incredible synth-rock soundtrack and cinematic boss encounters that utilize the Saturn's transparency and lighting effects. This Japanese version is considered a technical masterpiece, representing the peak of Technosoft's 32-bit development.
