Known as Seven Mansions, this is a unique co-op capable survival horror game. Players control two protagonists simultaneously (or with a friend) to solve puzzles and fight biological monsters across a series of mansions. Disc 2 continues the exploration of the sinister facility, featuring more complex puzzles that require the two characters to work together from different parts of the map. The game features a distinct art style and a tense atmosphere that blends horror elements with traditional JRPG progression.
