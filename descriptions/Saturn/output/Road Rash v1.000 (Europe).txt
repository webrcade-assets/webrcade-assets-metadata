Road Rash brings the brutal world of illegal motorcycle street racing to the Saturn with a high-energy 32-bit upgrade. Players must race across various California-inspired landscapes while fending off rival bikers with chains, clubs, and kicks. The game features a grunge-inspired soundtrack featuring bands like Soundgarden and includes FMV sequences that capture the rebellious 'biker' culture of the era. Success requires winning races to earn money for faster bikes while avoiding both the police and hospital stays.
