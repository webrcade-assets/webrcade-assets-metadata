A high-speed kart racing game that focuses on realism rather than the 'item-based' antics of Mario Kart. Players compete on international karting circuits, where maintaining the racing line and managing drift is the key to victory. This 'Special Edition' features improved graphics and additional tracks compared to the standard release. It offers a surprisingly challenging racing experience with a focus on tight, competitive heats and smooth frame rates.
