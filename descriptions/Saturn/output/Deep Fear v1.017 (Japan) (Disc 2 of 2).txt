The conclusion of the Japanese version of Deep Fear. Players navigate the lowest levels of the underwater base, facing off against the most dangerous biological threats. The game's soundtrack, composed by Kenji Kawai, reaches its peak here, underscoring the claustrophobic and desperate atmosphere of the deep-sea setting. It remains a cult favorite for Saturn owners as the last major survival horror game released for the system.
