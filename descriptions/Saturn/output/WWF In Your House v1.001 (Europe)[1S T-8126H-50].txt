A follow-up to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game, WWF In Your House features digitized sprites of legends like Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker. The gameplay is over-the-top and arcade-oriented, featuring special moves that are more like a fighting game than a wrestling simulation (e.g., The Undertaker throwing ghosts). The European version features smooth performance and high-quality CD-audio commentary by Vince McMahon. It is a loud, colorful, and chaotic tribute to the WWF's 'New Generation' era, perfect for multiplayer fun.
