The North American release of the iconic clockwork platformer. As Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau, players must hop, dash, and spin their wind-up key through a series of stages designed to look like a realistic human home from a toy's perspective. The game’s charm lies in its whimsical character designs and the creative use of 3D scaling for its bosses. This revision fixed several minor bugs from the initial launch and refined the hit detection for Pepperouchau's key-spinning attack.
