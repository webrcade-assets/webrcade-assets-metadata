The standard European release of Shellshock. The game stands out for its high level of environmental destruction—nearly every building and vehicle in the 3D world can be reduced to rubble. Players must manage their tank's armor and ammunition while engaging in intense firefights across various international conflict zones. The game's use of FMV cutscenes and its aggressive, mid-90s style made it a memorable action title for the Saturn, providing a more 'street-level' take on the vehicular combat genre.
