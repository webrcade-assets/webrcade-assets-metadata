Part of the Sega Ages collection, this release is a pixel-perfect port of the legendary arcade hit. Players take control of a highly maneuverable F-14 Tomcat jet, engaging endless waves of enemy fighters across high-speed scrolling landscapes. The game is famous for its lock-on missile system and intense sense of speed, fueled by a high-energy synth-rock soundtrack. This Saturn version includes options for various flight stick configurations to mimic the original arcade experience.
