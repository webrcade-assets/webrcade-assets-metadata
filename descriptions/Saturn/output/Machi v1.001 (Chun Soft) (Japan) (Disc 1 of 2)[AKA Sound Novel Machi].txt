Widely considered one of the greatest visual novels of all time, Machi follows the intersecting lives of eight different protagonists in Shibuya, Tokyo. Using a unique 'Zapping' system, players must switch between characters to resolve 'Bad Ends' caused by actions in other storylines. The game uses thousands of high-quality photographs of real actors and locations instead of illustrations, creating a 'live-action' feel. Disc 1 introduces the complex web of characters, ranging from a detective to a struggling actor.
