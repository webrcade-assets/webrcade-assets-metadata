The North American launch edition of Daytona USA. Released to compete directly with the PlayStation's Ridge Racer, it offered a more simulation-heavy handling model and the inclusion of manual or automatic transmissions. While criticized for its 'pop-up' geometry, the gameplay remains a perfect translation of the arcade's drift-heavy mechanics. This version helped define the Saturn's early identity as the home for arcade-perfect Sega experiences.
