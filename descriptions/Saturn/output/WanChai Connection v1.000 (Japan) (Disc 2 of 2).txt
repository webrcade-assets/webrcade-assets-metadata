The concluding disc of the WanChai Connection mystery. As the investigation deepens, the stakes increase, leading to several dramatic plot twists and a climactic resolution. This disc features more intense interrogation sequences and requires the player to piece together all the clues gathered across the two-disc journey. The game is highly regarded for its authentic Hong Kong atmosphere and its mature, noir-inspired narrative. It remains a unique example of the 'Sound Novel' genre's evolution into a fully cinematic 3D adventure on the system.
