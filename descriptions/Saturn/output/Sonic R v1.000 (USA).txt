The North American release of Sonic Team's racing title. Sonic R emphasizes exploration within a racing context, as tracks are wide-open and filled with collectible rings and hidden 'Sonic Tokens.' The handling model requires players to master drifting and jumping to take advantage of shortcuts. The US version includes the full iconic vocal soundtrack and supports the 3D Control Pad for smoother analog steering. Its colorful, high-contrast graphics were a major showcase for the Saturn's ability to handle fast-moving 3D geometry.
