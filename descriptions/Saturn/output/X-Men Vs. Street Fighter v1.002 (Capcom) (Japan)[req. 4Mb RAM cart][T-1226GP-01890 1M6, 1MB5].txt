The ultimate crossover fighter, this game **requires the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge** to deliver an experience that is virtually indistinguishable from the arcade original. It features a tag-team battle system where players can switch characters mid-combat to perform devastating team-up attacks. The Saturn version is a technical tour-de-force, maintaining incredible animation quality and a rock-solid frame rate. It remains one of the most highly-regarded fighting games in the system's library, representing the peak of Capcom's 2D sprite-based development.
