The standard 1997 release of Sega’s premier baseball franchise. It introduced higher-resolution character models and a more realistic ball-physics engine compared to the '96 version. The game includes full season tracking, trades, and a variety of camera angles that provide a TV-style broadcast experience. Its depth of statistics and authentic presentation made it a must-have for Japanese Saturn owners who followed the professional baseball season.
