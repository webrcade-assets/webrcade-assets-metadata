The sequel to Rise of the Robots, Resurrection features a significantly larger roster of cyborg combatants and much faster gameplay. The game uses pre-rendered sprites to create highly detailed, metallic fighters. It features a unique 'finisher' system and multi-layered arenas. This European multi-language release focuses on the war between the cyborg factions, offering a dark sci-fi aesthetic and a techno soundtrack by Brian May. It is a major improvement over its predecessor in terms of speed and mechanical depth.
