The Brotherhood of Nod disc for the European Saturn release. Playing as Nod offers a different tactical experience, focusing on stealth, chemical weapons, and the Flame Tank. This disc contains the unique FMV cutscenes for the Nod storyline, featuring Kane's iconic speeches. The game tracks the player's performance across missions, rewarding tactical efficiency with different branching paths through the campaign map. The Saturn's internal memory allows for saving mid-mission, a vital feature for the longer, more difficult later stages.
