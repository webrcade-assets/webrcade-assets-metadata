Based on the cult classic sci-fi anime 'Martian Successor Nadesico,' this title is a mix of visual novel storytelling and tactical combat. Players interact with the crew of the Nadesico, making choices that influence relationships—particularly with the protagonist Akito. The 'Ai ga Katsu' (Love Wins) subtitle hints at the game's focus on the romantic subplots of the series. It features original voice work from the anime cast and high-quality stills that capture the show's unique blend of comedy and space opera drama.
