Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Space Hulk is a tense hybrid of tactical strategy and first-person shooting. Players command a squad of Terminator Space Marines as they board massive, derelict starships to eradicate Genestealer infestations. The game features a unique HUD that allows you to monitor your squad's viewpoints in real-time. Players must issue commands to hold corridors and manage fire zones, but can take direct control of any marine for fast-paced combat. Its claustrophobic atmosphere and high difficulty make it a definitive sci-fi experience.
