Known in the West as Iron Storm, this is the original Japanese release of the deep WWII tactical simulator. The game features hex-based movement across large maps and a massive database of realistic military units from Germany, Japan, and the USA. This version is famous for its cinematic 3D battle animations that trigger whenever two units engage. It is a slow-paced and highly technical wargame that rewards deep historical knowledge and tactical foresight, serving as a landmark title for the strategy genre on the Saturn in Japan.
