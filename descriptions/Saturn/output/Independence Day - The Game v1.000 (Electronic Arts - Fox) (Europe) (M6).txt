Based on the 1996 blockbuster film, Independence Day is a mission-based flight action game. Players pilot various fighter jets to defend world cities—including London, Paris, and New York—from massive alien city-destroyer ships. Each mission involves destroying alien attackers and eventually disabling the main ship's shield to deliver the final blow. The game features 3D environments and voice acting that mirrors the tone of the movie. This European release features multi-language support and captures the high-stakes 'save the world' energy of the film.
