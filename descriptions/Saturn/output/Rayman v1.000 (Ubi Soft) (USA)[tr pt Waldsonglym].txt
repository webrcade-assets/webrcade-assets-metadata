A fan-translated version of the North American release of Rayman. This version includes a full Portuguese translation of the text and menus, courtesy of Waldsonglym. It allows Lusophone players to easily navigate the game's menus and understand the hints provided by characters like Betilla the Fairy. The translation maintains the whimsical and fairy-tale tone of the original, ensuring that the charm of the 'Dream Forest' and 'Band Land' remains intact for a new audience.
