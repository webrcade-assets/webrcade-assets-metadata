World Cup Golf provides a realistic and high-resolution golfing simulation on the Saturn. The game features several internationally famous courses and utilizes a mix of 3D polygonal terrain and pre-rendered assets to create a visually sharp experience. Players can choose from a variety of pro-style clubs and must account for wind speed and terrain friction with every swing. The European release is praised for its clean interface and deep statistical tracking, offering a sophisticated and relaxing alternative to the more arcade-leaning sports titles on the system.
