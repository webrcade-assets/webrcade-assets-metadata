This 'Deluxe Pack' contains two of Konami's most whimsical arcade shooters: Parodius Da! and Gokujou Parodius. These games are parodies of the Gradius series, featuring bizarre characters like flying pigs, octopuses, and giant showgirls as bosses. The Saturn versions are high-quality arcade ports that maintain the vibrant colors and chaotic, bell-powered power-up system. With a large roster of playable characters, each with unique weapon sets, this compilation offers some of the most charming and creative 'cute 'em up' action on the console.
