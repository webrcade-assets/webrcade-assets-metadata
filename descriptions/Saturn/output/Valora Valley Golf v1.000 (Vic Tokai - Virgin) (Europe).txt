Known as Remote Control Dandy in Japan, Valora Valley Golf is a 3D golfing simulation with a focus on stylized environments and accessible controls. Unlike more serious golf sims, Valora Valley features vibrant, colorful courses and a more 'arcade' feel to its swing mechanics. It offers several game modes including stroke play and skins, and is noted for its smooth 3D engine that allows for quick transitions between holes. It served as a solid alternative to the PGA Tour series for European Saturn owners looking for a more relaxed golfing experience.
