A point-and-click adventure based on the wildly popular Discworld novels. Players control Rincewind, an inept wizard voiced by Eric Idle, as he attempts to save the city of Ankh-Morpork from a dragon. The game features high-resolution 2D art and thousands of lines of witty, fully-voiced dialogue. The puzzles are notoriously difficult and require 'Discworld logic,' rewarding players for their creativity and knowledge of the books. This European release features multi-language support and remains a definitive adaptation of Terry Pratchett’s surreal fantasy world.
