Known as Blazing Heroes in North America and Riglord Saga in Japan, Mystaria is one of the Saturn's premier tactical RPGs. Players control a team of heroes on a grid-based battlefield, using a mix of melee attacks and magic to overthrow an invading empire. The game is unique for its use of 3D polygonal environments and characters during a time when many RPGs still used 2D sprites. It features a deep skill system where characters learn new abilities through repeated use in combat, rewarding long-term strategy and unit management.
