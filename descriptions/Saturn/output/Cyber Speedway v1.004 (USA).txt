The North American release of Sega's premier 32-bit hover racer. This version features a pulse-pounding soundtrack and refined controls over the initial Japanese release. Players can choose from multiple pilots, each with their own unique craft and handling characteristics. The game’s 3D engine was considered impressive at the time for its ability to handle high speeds and large-scale environmental objects without significant slowdown, making it a key title in the Saturn's early racing library.
