The first home port of Sega’s legendary Model 2 arcade racer. As a launch-era title in Japan, it was a showcase for the Saturn's ability to handle texture-mapped 3D polygons. Players race the iconic Hornet car across three tracks: Three-Seven Speedway, Dinosaur Canyon, and Sea-Side Street. Despite having a lower frame rate than the arcade, it famously retained the 'vocal' soundtrack that became a hallmark of the franchise.
