Airs Adventure is a traditional JRPG that tells the story of Henry, a young adventurer who sets out to rescue a princess and save his kingdom from a burgeoning darkness. The game is notable for its unique visual style, blending 2D hand-drawn character portraits with 3D pre-rendered environments. Combat follows a classic turn-based structure, but the game world is vast, featuring numerous floating islands and ancient ruins to explore.
