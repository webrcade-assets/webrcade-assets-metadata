Known as Dynamite Deka in Japan, Die Hard Arcade is a 3D side-scrolling beat 'em up that serves as a spiritual successor to games like Streets of Rage. Players control John McClane (or Kris Thompsen) as they fight through a skyscraper to rescue the president's daughter. The game is famous for its 'Quick Time Events' during cinematic transitions and its wide variety of improvised weapons, including grandfather clocks and pepper shakers. The Saturn port is a perfect translation of the ST-V arcade original.
