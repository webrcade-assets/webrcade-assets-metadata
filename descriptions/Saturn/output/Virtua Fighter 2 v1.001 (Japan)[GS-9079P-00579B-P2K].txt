The Japanese home port of the Model 2 arcade phenomenon. Virtua Fighter 2 on the Saturn is a technical masterclass, running at a rock-solid 60 frames per second in a high-resolution mode. It introduced the 'Dodge' mechanic and two new characters, Shun Di and Lion Rafale. This version is celebrated for its deep, technical combat system that emphasizes realistic martial arts over flashy special moves. It was a massive success in Japan, serving as the definitive showcase for the Saturn’s 3D processing power.
