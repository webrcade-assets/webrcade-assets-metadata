The definitive version of the game known in the West as Symphony of the Night. Players control Alucard, the son of Dracula, as he explores a sprawling, non-linear castle to stop his father's resurrection. The Saturn version is famous for its exclusive content, including the ability to play as Maria Renard or Richter Belmont from the start, as well as two new areas: the Cursed Prison and the Underground Garden. It combines platforming with deep RPG elements like equipment management and leveling.
