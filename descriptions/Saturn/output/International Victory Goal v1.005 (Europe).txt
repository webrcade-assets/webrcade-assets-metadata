Known as Worldwide Soccer in North America and Victory Goal in Japan, this was Sega's premier soccer title for the Saturn's launch era. The game features a 3D stadium environment with 2D sprites for the players, offering a balance of fluid animation and deep tactical options. Players can choose from dozens of national teams and compete in various cup formats. The European version is noted for its accessible arcade-style gameplay and served as a strong foundational title for Sega's future soccer simulations on the platform.
