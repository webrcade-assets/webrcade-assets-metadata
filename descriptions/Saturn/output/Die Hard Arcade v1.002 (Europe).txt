The European release of Sega’s premier 3D brawler. The game combines traditional punch-and-kick combat with cinematic action sequences. It is highly regarded for its humorous tone and chaotic gameplay, especially in two-player co-op mode. The Saturn version also includes a port of the classic Sega arcade game 'Deep Scan,' which players can play to earn extra credits for the main game. Its fluid animation and fun combat system make it one of the best arcade ports on the console.
