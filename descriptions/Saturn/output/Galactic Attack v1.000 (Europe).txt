A home port of the legendary Taito arcade game RayForce. Galactic Attack is famous for its unique dual-layer lock-on system: players can shoot enemies on their own level with a primary vulcan cannon, or lock onto enemies in the background/foreground to unleash a barrage of homing lasers. This 'layered' gameplay creates a deep and strategic shooting experience that is beautifully complemented by some of the best 2D pixel art and scaling effects of the 32-bit era.
