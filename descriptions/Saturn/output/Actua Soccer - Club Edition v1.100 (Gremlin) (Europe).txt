An upgraded version of the original Actua Soccer, this 'Club Edition' features a roster focus on major European league teams. The game was a pioneer in using fully 3D polygonal players instead of 2D sprites, allowing for dynamic camera movements and multiple replay angles. It includes motion-captured animations from real professional players to provide a sense of realism in ball handling, tackling, and goal celebrations.
