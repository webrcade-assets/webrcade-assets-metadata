Gale Racer is the home port of the arcade game Rad Mobile. It is a first-person cockpit racer where players drive across the United States, facing various weather conditions like rain and fog. The game is notable for its use of 2D scaling to create a high-speed driving experience and its quirky details, like the hanging Sonic the Hedgehog air freshener in the car. It offers a nostalgic arcade experience with a focus on time-attack racing and environmental hazards.
