Widely considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Panzer Dragoon Saga (Azel in Japan) shifts the series from a rail shooter to an immersive open-world adventure. Disc 1 introduces the protagonist Edge and his encounter with a mysterious girl named Azel and a powerful dragon. The game features a unique real-time/turn-based hybrid battle system where positioning your dragon in 3D space is key to survival. The production values were unprecedented, featuring full voice acting and high-quality CGI across four discs.
