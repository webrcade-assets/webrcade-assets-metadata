Saturn Bomber Man is widely considered the best entry in the entire franchise. It is famous for its massive 10-player local multiplayer mode (requiring two multitaps), which utilizes the Saturn's high-resolution wide-screen mode. The game features a long story mode with branching paths, various dinosaur mounts (Tirras) with unique abilities, and classic grid-based gameplay. The European version preserves the frantic and addictive gameplay that makes it a must-have title for party gaming on the system.
