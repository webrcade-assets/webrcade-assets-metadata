Slam 'N Jam '96 brings high-flying, arcade-style basketball to the Saturn, featuring the likenesses and endorsements of legends Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The game utilizes a pseudo-3D engine that provides a dynamic, scrolling perspective of the court. It emphasizes over-the-top dunks, fast breaks, and accessible controls, making it a competitive alternative to the NBA Jam series. The European version includes all the smooth animations and high-energy commentary that made it a standout sports title during the system's early years.
