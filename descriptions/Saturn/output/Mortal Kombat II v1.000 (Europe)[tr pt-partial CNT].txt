This version of the classic arcade fighter Mortal Kombat II features a partial Portuguese fan translation. It includes the full roster of legendary fighters like Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Jax. The gameplay remains a faithful recreation of the arcade's high-stakes martial arts combat, complete with the series' signature stage hazards and brutal finishing moves. This specific version aims to make the menus and character endings more accessible to the Portuguese-speaking community while retaining the original high-quality CD audio and sprite work.
