Sega's magnum opus on the Saturn. This RPG takes the rail-shooter combat of the previous games and adapts it into a deep turn-based system involving positioning and weak points. Disc 1 introduces Edge and his dragon as they embark on a quest to stop the Empire. It is celebrated for its world-building and atmosphere.
