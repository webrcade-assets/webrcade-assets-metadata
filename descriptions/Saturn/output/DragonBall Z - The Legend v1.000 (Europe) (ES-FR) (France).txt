Released exclusively in Europe and Japan, The Legend is a unique departure from traditional 2D fighters. It features a '360-degree' battle system where teams of three fighters engage in high-speed aerial combat. The game perfectly captures the scale of the anime, as players can knock opponents through mountains and across massive landscapes. This European version features localized text for the Spanish and French markets, and is highly prized by collectors for its arcade-accurate presentation of the Dragon Ball Z 'Greatest Legend' storylines.
