True Pinball aims for extreme realism, offering four meticulously designed tables: Vikings, Law & Justice, Babewatch, and Extreme Sports. The game features a sophisticated physics engine that accurately simulates ball weight and flipper response. Players can toggle between a classic 2D top-down view and a more cinematic 3D scrolling view. The European version is noted for its clean presentation and its attempt to replicate the mechanical feel of real physical pinball machines, including the ability to 'nudge' the table (carefully) to influence the ball.
