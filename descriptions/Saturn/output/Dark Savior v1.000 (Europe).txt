A unique isometric action RPG that uses a 'parallels' system to offer multiple completely different storylines based on how quickly the player completes the opening prison escape. Players control a bounty hunter named Garian as he tracks down a monster known as Bilar. The game features 3D environments, 2D sprites, and a 1-on-1 fighting game-style battle system. With its focus on precision platforming and branching narrative paths, it remains one of the most creative titles in the Saturn library.
