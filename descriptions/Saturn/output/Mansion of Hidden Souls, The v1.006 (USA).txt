A cinematic first-person adventure game where players explore a mysterious mansion filled with people who have been turned into butterflies. Unlike its predecessor on the Sega CD, the Saturn version features much higher-quality graphics and a more traditional puzzle-adventure structure. The game focuses on atmosphere and storytelling, as players must uncover the tragic secrets of the mansion's owner to rescue their sister. It is a slow-paced, moody title that showcases the Saturn's ability to handle high-quality FMV and pre-rendered environments.
