Developed by Toaplan, this is often considered the grandfather of the 'bullet hell' (danmaku) sub-genre. It features an experience-based leveling system for weapons and intense screen-filling enemy fire. The Saturn port is arcade-perfect and includes both the original and a 'Special' arranged version with smaller hitboxes.
