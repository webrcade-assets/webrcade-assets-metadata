An unusual FMV-based football game starring Mike Ditka. Players take the role of the quarterback in a first-person perspective, making split-second decisions to pass, hand-off, or run based on real video footage of a football game. The game requires high focus and timing to succeed, as wrong choices lead to realistic sacks or interceptions. It is a unique '90s artifact that attempts to use the Saturn's video capabilities to provide a 'true' NFL experience from a player's eyes.
