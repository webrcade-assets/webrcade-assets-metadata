The sequel to the surreal platforming hit brings even more variety and bizarre humor to the 32-bit era. Players control Jim through a series of increasingly strange levels, ranging from a platforming stage involving falling cows to a top-down isometric shooting mission inside an intestinal tract. The Saturn version features enhanced CD-quality audio and vastly improved background details compared to the 16-bit versions. Its smooth animation and creative level design make it a showcase of high-end 2D sprite work on the Saturn.
