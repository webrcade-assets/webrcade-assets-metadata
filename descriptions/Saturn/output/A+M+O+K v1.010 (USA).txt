Piloting the powerful Slavedriver walker, players engage in intense search-and-destroy missions across multiple hostile environments. A+M+O+K focuses on fluid movement and rapid fire, tasking the player with eliminating high-priority targets and clearing waves of mechanized infantry. The Saturn version is noted for its smooth framerate and extensive use of the console's VDP processors to handle the complex sprite scaling and explosions.
