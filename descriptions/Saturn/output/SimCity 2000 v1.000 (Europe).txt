The definitive city-building simulation arrives on the Saturn with all the depth of the PC original. SimCity 2000 introduces isometric 3D graphics, allowing players to build complex cities with varied terrain elevations, underground water pipes, and diverse zone types. Players must manage taxes, public services, and budgets while dealing with random disasters like fires and monster attacks. The European version includes several pre-built scenarios and is noted for its polished interface, which was well-adapted for console play using the Saturn's controller.
