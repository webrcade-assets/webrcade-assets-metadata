A unique arena-based robot fighter where customization is the key to victory. Players build their own combat robots from a variety of parts, including different types of arms (claws, swords, lasers) and movement bases (legs, treads, wheels). After building a machine, players climb the rankings by defeating other robots in 3D arenas. Defeating opponents allows you to claim their parts to further enhance your own creation. The gameplay is fast and arcade-oriented, with a heavy focus on the 'Build-and-Battle' loop.
