The European release of the Aerosmith-themed shooter. Players blast through various world locations, from London to the Amazon, fighting off waves of futuristic soldiers and tanks. The game is known for its secret paths and hidden items that unlock special videos of the band. Despite its simple gameplay, it remains a cult classic for its sheer absurdity and its faithful translation of the arcade's digitized visuals to the Saturn's hardware.
