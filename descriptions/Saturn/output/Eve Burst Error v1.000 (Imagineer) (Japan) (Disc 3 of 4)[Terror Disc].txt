The 'Terror' disc serves as the bridge between the two investigations, bringing the storylines of Kojiroh and Marina together as they begin to realize they are working on the same case from different angles. This disc features more intense dialogue choices and critical investigation points that lead into the game's final act. The Saturn version is widely considered the best way to experience the original art style and the atmospheric, synth-heavy soundtrack.
