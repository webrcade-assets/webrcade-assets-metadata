The North American release of Sonic's isometric adventure. Tasked with clearing seven zones, players must collect Flickies to activate the warp rings at the end of each sub-section. The Saturn release features exclusive weather effects, like fog and rain, that were not present in the Genesis original. The game focuses more on exploration and puzzle-solving than traditional high-speed Sonic platforming. It remains a unique visual showcase for the system, particularly for its use of pre-rendered character sprites and high-fidelity environmental textures.
