A perfect home conversion of Yu Suzuki's arcade masterpiece. As the Harrier, players fly through the 'Fantasy Zone,' blasting surreal enemies like stone heads and dragons. The Saturn version is famous for its 60FPS 'Smooth Mode,' which provides a more fluid experience than the original arcade hardware. Part of the Sega Ages collection, it includes the original soundtrack and various difficulty settings. It remains one of the most accessible and visually striking arcade ports on the system, perfectly capturing the vibrant 'Blue Skies' era of Sega.
