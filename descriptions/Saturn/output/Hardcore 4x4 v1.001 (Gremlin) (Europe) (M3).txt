Hardcore 4x4 is an off-road racing game that focuses on the physics of driving through mud, snow, and sand. Players can choose from several licensed-style 4x4 trucks and compete across rugged cross-country circuits. A standout feature is the game's suspension physics, which allows the trucks to bounce and react realistically to the uneven terrain. The M3 European release includes localized text for multiple regions and features a gritty rock soundtrack that fits the tough, off-road theme.
