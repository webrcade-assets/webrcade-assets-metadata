Set in a realistic near-future conflict, Gun Griffon puts players in the cockpit of the HIGH-MACS armored walker. Unlike more arcade-style mech games, Gun Griffon emphasizes tactical movement and long-range engagement. The game features impressive 3D environments, including urban cities and forest valleys, with a smooth frame rate that was highly praised at launch. Players must manage their ammunition and flight-boosters carefully to complete various military objectives across a global war zone.
