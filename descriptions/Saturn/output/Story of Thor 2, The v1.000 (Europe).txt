Known as Legend of Oasis in North America, this is the prequel to the Mega Drive's Beyond Oasis. The game is a top-down action-adventure with a heavy emphasis on combat and summoning elemental spirits. Players explore a vast fantasy world, solving puzzles that require the use of spirits like Dytto (Water) and Efreet (Fire). The Saturn version features some of the finest 2D sprite work on the system, with massive bosses and fluid character animations. The European release is highly prized for its vibrant art style and its deep, exploration-heavy gameplay.
