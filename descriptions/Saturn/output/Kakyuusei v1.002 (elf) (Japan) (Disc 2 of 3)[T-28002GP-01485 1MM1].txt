The middle chapter of the Kakyuusei experience. This disc covers the summer and autumn months of the school year, featuring seasonal events like the school festival and summer vacations. The depth of character interaction increases here, with the protagonist needing to balance multiple relationships and stat-building activities. The Saturn version features an arranged soundtrack and full voice acting for all the heroines, which was a significant upgrade over the original PC-98 release.
