Widely regarded as the definitive competitive entry in the Puyo Puyo series. This version introduced the 'offsetting' (Sousai) rule, which allows players to counter garbage Puyos sent by their opponents. The Saturn version features improved graphics, a wealth of voice acting, and various secret modes. Its perfect balance and deep chain-building mechanics make it a staple of the puzzle genre, and this specific revision is highly sought after for its refined gameplay and polished presentation.
