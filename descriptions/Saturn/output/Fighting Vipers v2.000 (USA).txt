The North American release of Fighting Vipers, featuring the iconic armored combat and cage-match mechanics. This version is highly regarded for its responsive controls and the fun, over-the-top nature of its special moves. Players can knock their opponents high into the air and perform mid-air combos, a rarity for 3D fighters at the time. The US release was a key part of Sega’s marketing push for a more 'edgy' alternative to competing fighting games.
