The massive sequel to the original Sakura Taisen, expanding the story of the Imperial Combat Revue in a steampunk 1920s Tokyo. Disc 1 introduces two new team members, Orihime and Leni, and sets up a new threat from a dark organization. The game refined the 'LIPS' (Live & Interactive Picture System) dialogue mechanic, adding a timer to choices that influences the relationships between the protagonist, Ichiro Ogami, and the female pilots. It features high-quality anime production values and a catchy orchestral score.
