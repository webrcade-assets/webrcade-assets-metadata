One of the earliest 3D platformers, Bug! takes place on a grid-based 3D path. Players must hop on enemies and navigate environmental hazards as they film a movie within the game world. The levels are divided into different 'sets' like the jungle and the desert, each ending with a large 3D boss fight. Its unique 'walk anywhere' mechanics—allowing Bug to climb around the sides of platforms—was a major showcase for the Saturn's early 3D capabilities.
