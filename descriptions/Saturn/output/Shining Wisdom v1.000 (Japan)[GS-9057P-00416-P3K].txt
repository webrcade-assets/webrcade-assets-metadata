A departure for the Shining series, Shining Wisdom is a top-down action-adventure game similar in style to The Legend of Zelda. Players control a hero named Mars as he explores the kingdom of Odegan to stop an ancient evil. The game features a unique 'dash' mechanic that allows Mars to move at high speeds and attack enemies. This Japanese version showcases the series' signature bright, colorful art style and features a deep equipment system where players combine different items to create magical effects. It is a charming and fast-paced entry in the legendary franchise.
