The follow-up to Athlete Kings (Decathlete), Winter Heat brings the same high-intensity arcade sports action to the Winter Olympics. Featuring 11 events including downhill skiing, bobsled, and speed skating, the game focuses on rapid button-mashing and precise timing. The European version features vibrant 3D graphics and a fun, competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players. It is highly regarded for its polished presentation and its ability to turn the complex physics of winter sports into accessible and addictive arcade fun, serving as one of the best sports titles on the system.
