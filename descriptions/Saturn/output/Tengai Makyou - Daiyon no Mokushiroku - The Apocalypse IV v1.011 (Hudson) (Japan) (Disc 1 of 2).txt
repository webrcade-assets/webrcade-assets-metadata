The fourth main entry in the Far East of Eden series, this RPG takes place in a stylized, comedic version of 1890s America. Disc 1 introduces the protagonist and his journey across the Western United States to stop a dark cult. The game is famous for its high-quality production, including full-screen cinematic sequences and a humorous script that parodies American culture and history. The battle system features large, expressive character sprites and a deep magic system, making it one of the most visually impressive JRPGs on the platform.
