As the story reaches its mid-point, Adrienne must find a way to exorcise the spirits haunting the house. This disc focuses on the lore of the 'Dark World' and the dangerous rituals that took place in the mansion's secret chapel. The Saturn version benefits from the internal memory for saving progress, which is vital given the game's non-linear investigation paths and the constant threat of a gruesome 'game over' scene.
