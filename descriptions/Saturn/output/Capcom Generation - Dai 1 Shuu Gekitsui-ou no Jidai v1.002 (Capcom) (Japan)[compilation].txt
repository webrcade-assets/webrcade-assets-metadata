The first volume of Capcom's celebrated arcade collection, subtitled 'The Age of the Ace.' This compilation features three of the most influential vertical-scrolling shooters from the 1940s aerial combat series: 1942, 1943: The Battle of Midway, and 1943 Kai. These ports are highly accurate to the original hardware, including options for 'TATE' mode (vertical screen orientation) and an extensive gallery filled with historical production art and arranged soundtracks.
