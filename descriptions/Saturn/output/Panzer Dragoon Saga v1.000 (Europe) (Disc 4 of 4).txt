The final disc of Panzer Dragoon Saga leads to a climactic confrontation with the source of the world's misery. It contains the emotional resolution of Edge and Azel's story and a meta-narrative twist that broke the 'fourth wall' in a way rarely seen in 1990s gaming. Because of its extremely limited print run in the West, this remains one of the most expensive and sought-after titles in the Saturn library. It stands as a hauntingly beautiful farewell to the console from Team Andromeda.
