A high-speed motorcycle racer based on the legendary Isle of Man TT race. Players compete on two tracks: Laxey Coast and the grueling main TT Course. The game features a 'super-smooth' frame rate and responsive handling that captures the thrill of high-speed bike racing. The European version includes several different bikes with varying stats and supports the Arcade Racer steering wheel for a more immersive experience. Its vibrant visuals and arcade-perfect physics made it one of the Saturn's best late-era racers.
