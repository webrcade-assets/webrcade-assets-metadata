An enhanced port of the classic tactical RPG. Players lead a liberation army against an evil empire, managing units across a large world map in real-time. The game features a deep alignment system where the player's choices and reputation determine which of the multiple endings they receive. The Saturn version is widely considered the best version of the game, featuring voiced dialogue for the main characters, high-quality arranged music, and significantly faster loading times than the Super Famicom original.
