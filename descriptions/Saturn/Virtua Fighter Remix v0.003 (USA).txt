The North American release of Virtua Fighter Remix. This revision features the most polished version of the textured character models and fixed several minor camera collision bugs found in the initial Japanese release. It includes the full arcade ladder and a robust versus mode. The US version is a fan favorite for its smooth 30FPS gameplay and its role in proving the Saturn's ability to handle high-quality texture mapping. It stands as the definitive way to experience the first Virtua Fighter on the console.
