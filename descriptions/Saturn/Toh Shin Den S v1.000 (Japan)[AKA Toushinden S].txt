Known in the West as Battle Arena Toshinden Remix, this Japanese version is a weapon-based 3D fighter that was a key early rival to the Tekken and Virtua Fighter series. It features a diverse cast of characters, including the swordsman Eiji and the dancer Ellis. The Saturn version is notable for its high-quality CD audio and the 'Remix' enhancements which include additional story elements and character portraits. The gameplay is focused on the 'sidestep' mechanic, allowing for tactical 3D movement to avoid vertical strikes.
