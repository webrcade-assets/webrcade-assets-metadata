A bizarre 2D fighting game featuring large, digitized sprites of horrific monsters and mythical creatures. Battles take place on multi-tiered 2.5D arenas where players can jump between different platforms to gain a height advantage. The environments are filled with hazards like spikes and pits that can be used to damage opponents. The game's dark, gritty atmosphere and unique stage layouts set it apart from contemporary arcade fighters.
