Ghen War is an early 3D first-person shooter where players pilot a bipedal power suit to protect a lunar mining colony from an invading alien race known as the Ghen. The game features 3D terrain and destructible environments, which was a technical showcase for the Saturn at the time. Players must navigate through canyons and tunnels, using a variety of energy weapons and missiles to take down insectoid machines. The European version includes cinematic FMV sequences that provide the narrative context for the interplanetary conflict.
