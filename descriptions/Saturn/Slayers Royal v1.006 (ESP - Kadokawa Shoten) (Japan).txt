Based on the popular Slayers anime and light novel franchise, Slayers Royal is a tactical RPG that blends grid-based combat with visual novel-style storytelling. Players control Lina Inverse and her companions as they navigate a humorous and action-packed narrative. The combat features isometric 3D battlefields and large, well-animated character sprites. One of the highlights is the extensive use of original voice acting from the anime cast and the inclusion of high-quality animated cutscenes that stay faithful to the series' comedic tone.
