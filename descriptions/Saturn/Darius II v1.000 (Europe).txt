The European release of the sequel to Taito's legendary shmup. Known as Sagaia in some regions, Darius II features the series' signature aquatic-themed bosses and multi-path stages. The game is notable for its 'zoomed-out' perspective, which was designed to accommodate the arcade's three-screen setup. The Saturn version includes various screen modes and a high-quality CD soundtrack, making it the best home version of this classic coin-op title for many years.
