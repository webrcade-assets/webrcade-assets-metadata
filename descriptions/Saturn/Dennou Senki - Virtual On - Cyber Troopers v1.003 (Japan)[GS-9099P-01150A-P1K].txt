An updated Japanese revision of Virtual On. This version includes balance adjustments to the various Virtuaroids and slightly refined netcode for the Link Cable support. Players can choose from eight different mechs, from the balanced Temjin to the heavily armored Raiden. The game's 'dash' mechanic is central to survival, requiring players to constantly move in 3D space to avoid incoming fire. This version is often considered the most balanced iteration for competitive play on the Saturn.
