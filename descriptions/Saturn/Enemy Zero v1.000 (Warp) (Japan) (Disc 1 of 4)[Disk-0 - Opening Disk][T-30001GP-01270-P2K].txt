The ambitious follow-up to 'D' by creator Kenji Eno. Enemy Zero is a unique blend of first-person exploration and survival horror where the enemies are completely invisible. Players must rely on a sound-based 'biomonitor' that emits different tones to determine the location and distance of the predators. This first disc contains the cinematic opening of the game, establishing the isolation and dread of the space station Aki, and serves as the initial setup for Laura’s terrifying journey.
