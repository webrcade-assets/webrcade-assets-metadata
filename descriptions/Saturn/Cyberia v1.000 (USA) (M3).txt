A cinematic blend of puzzle-solving, exploration, and rail-shooting set in a high-tech future. Players take on the role of Zak, a hacker sent to infiltrate a secret base in Siberia to investigate a mysterious weapon known as 'Cyberia.' The game uses high-quality pre-rendered FMV for its transitions and backgrounds, seamlessly switching to real-time 3D during flight-combat sequences. The multi-path narrative and high-stakes puzzles made it a notable showcase for the Saturn's multimedia capabilities.
