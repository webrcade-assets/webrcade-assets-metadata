Part of the Sega Ages series, this is an arcade-perfect port of Yu Suzuki's masterpiece. Players drive a Ferrari Testarossa across a scenic branching landscape, racing against the clock and competing traffic. The Saturn version is highly prized for its 'smooth' 60FPS mode (which was double the frame rate of the original arcade hardware) and the inclusion of both the original and newly arranged versions of the legendary soundtrack. It is the definitive way to experience this classic 'driving' game on home hardware.
