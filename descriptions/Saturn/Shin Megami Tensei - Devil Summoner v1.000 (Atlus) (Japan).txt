The first entry in the Devil Summoner spin-off series, this JRPG follows Kyouji Kuzunoha, a detective who uses demons to solve supernatural cases in the fictional Yarai City. The game features classic first-person dungeon crawling and the iconic 'demon negotiation' system where players talk to enemies to convince them to join their party. The Saturn version is noted for its dark, occult atmosphere, its challenging difficulty, and its complex demon fusion system. It is a landmark title in the SMT franchise that established the urban-fantasy detective aesthetic.
