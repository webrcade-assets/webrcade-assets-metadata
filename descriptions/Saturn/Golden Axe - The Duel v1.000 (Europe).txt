Taking the legendary beat 'em up franchise into the 1-on-1 fighting arena, The Duel features a roster of descendants of the original heroes and villains. Players fight to claim the legendary Golden Axe, which occasionally drops into the arena, providing temporary power-ups. The game uses large, beautifully animated 2D sprites and features a 'Magic' system similar to the original series, where collecting potions allows for screen-filling elemental attacks. The European version is praised for its smooth 2D performance and faithful adherence to the franchise's dark fantasy aesthetic.
