The European release of the high-speed arena-based mech combat game. Virtual-On features the legendary 'Virtuaroids' designed by Hajime Katoki, engaging in 1-on-1 battles using a wide array of energy weapons and melee attacks. The game is known for its frantic 'dashing' mechanics and its unique control scheme, which is best experienced with the Saturn Twin Stick. This version is a faithful arcade conversion, offering smooth performance and vibrant, high-contrast 3D graphics that capture the high-tech aesthetic of the arcade original perfectly.
