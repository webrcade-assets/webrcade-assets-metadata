A gritty cyberpunk JRPG set in 'The City,' where humans have replaced their body parts with cybernetic enhancements to survive a harsh environment. The game features a unique 'Limb Targeting' battle system where players can choose to destroy specific parts of an enemy's body—such as their arms to lower attack power or legs to lower speed. This tactical depth is mirrored in the character customization, where the protagonist's stats and abilities change based on the cybernetic 'parts' they have equipped.
