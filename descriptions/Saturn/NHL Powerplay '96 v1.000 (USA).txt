Developed by Radical Entertainment, NHL Powerplay '96 is often considered one of the sleeper hits of the Saturn's sports library. It features a 'vertical' camera perspective that provides an excellent view of the rink's geometry. The game emphasizes strategic passing and positioning, offering a more methodical pace than Sega's All-Star Hockey. The US version includes the full NHL license and is praised for its clean graphics and the realistic way players interact with the boards and the puck.
