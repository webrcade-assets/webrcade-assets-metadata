An early licensed F1 racing simulation for the Saturn. The game features real teams and drivers from the 1995 season and offers several modes ranging from a quick arcade race to a full championship. It utilizes a 3D engine that emphasizes a cockpit-view experience, providing a sense of speed and technical demand. This European version was a key early title for racing fans looking for a more realistic alternative to Sega's own arcade racers.
