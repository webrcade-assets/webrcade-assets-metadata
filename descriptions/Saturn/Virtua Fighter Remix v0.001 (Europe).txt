The European release of the texture-mapped update to the original Virtua Fighter. This version was often given away to registered Saturn owners as a 'thank you' from Sega. It features significantly improved character models while maintaining the iconic eight-character roster and strategic ring-out mechanics. The European version is noted for its clean presentation and its role in re-introducing the series to a wider audience with modernized 32-bit visuals.
