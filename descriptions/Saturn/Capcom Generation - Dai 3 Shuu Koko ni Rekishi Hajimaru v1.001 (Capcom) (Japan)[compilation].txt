Subtitled 'The History Begins Here,' the third volume of the Capcom Generation series focuses on the foundations of the action-platformer and shooter genres. It includes the brutally difficult classics Makaimura (Ghosts 'n Goblins), Dai Makaimura (Ghouls 'n Ghosts), and Chou Makaimura (Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts). The Saturn version is particularly prized for its low input lag and faithful reproduction of the arcade sprites and color palettes, alongside a robust practice mode for mastering the notoriously difficult stages.
