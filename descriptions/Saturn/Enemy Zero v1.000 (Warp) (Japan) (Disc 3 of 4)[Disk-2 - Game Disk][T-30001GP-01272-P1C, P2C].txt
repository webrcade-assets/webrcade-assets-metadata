Disc 2 of the gameplay campaign for Enemy Zero. As Laura moves deeper into the station, the environments become more claustrophobic and the enemy AI becomes more aggressive. This disc contains some of the game's most difficult navigation challenges and key plot revelations. The game’s soundtrack, composed by Michael Nyman, creates a haunting, minimalist atmosphere that perfectly complements the high-stakes, sound-reliant combat mechanics.
