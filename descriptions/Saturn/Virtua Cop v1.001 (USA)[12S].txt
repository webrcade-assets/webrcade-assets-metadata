The North American release of Sega's premier 3D shooter. Virtua Cop set a new standard for accuracy and cinematic pacing in arcade ports. Players must navigate three distinct stages: Arms Depot, Underground Base, and Gang Headquarters. This '12S' revision features improved hit detection and optimized loading times. The US version was often bundled with the Virtua Gun, making it the definitive first-person shooting experience for many early Saturn owners and proving the system's arcade-porting dominance.
