In this 3D isometric adventure based on the 1995 feature film, players take control of Casper the Friendly Ghost as he navigates the sprawling corridors of Whipstaff Manor. To help his friend Kat and her father, Casper must find pieces of a machine known as the Lazarus. The gameplay focuses on exploration and problem-solving, as Casper must use his spectral abilities to morph into various objects—like fans to blow away obstacles or saws to cut through wood—to progress past the unfriendly ghost trio.
