The European launch version of Virtua Fighter. This port was a major technological milestone for home consoles, providing a 3D fighting experience that was previously only possible in high-end arcades. It features a diverse roster of martial artists, from the karate master Akira to the wrestler Wolf. This European release is optimized for 50Hz displays and captures the strategic, 'grounded' combat that would become the hallmark of the series. It remains a foundational title in the Saturn library, representing the system's early identity as an arcade powerhouse.
