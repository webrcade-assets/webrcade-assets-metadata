Known in the West as Mystaria, this is the original Japanese release of the system's first major 3D tactical RPG. Players follow the story of Prince Han and his allies as they attempt to reclaim their kingdom from an invading army. The game uses a hex-based grid for movement and features cinematic close-ups during attacks. It established the series' unique skill-learning system and provided a solid foundation for the 32-bit evolution of the tactical RPG genre.
