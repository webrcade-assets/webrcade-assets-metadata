The second entry in Capcom’s Darkstalkers series, Night Warriors features a cast of iconic monsters including Morrigan, Felicia, and Demitri. The game is famous for its fluid, high-frame-rate animation and its 'Hunter Chain' combo system. The Saturn version is a nearly perfect arcade port, utilizing the console's 2D prowess to deliver large, colorful sprites and screen-filling special attacks. It remains one of the most stylish and mechanically deep 2D fighters on the system, featuring a fantastic gothic-anime aesthetic.
