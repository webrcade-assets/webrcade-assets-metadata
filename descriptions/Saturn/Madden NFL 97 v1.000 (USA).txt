The North American release of Madden 97 brought the definitive NFL experience to the Saturn. It features over 100 sets of offensive and defensive plays, and for the first time, allowed players to create their own custom athletes. The game’s presentation was top-tier for 1996, featuring FMV clips of John Madden himself and detailed commentary. The Saturn version is noted for its fast loading times and responsive controls, making it a staple for sports fans on the console.
