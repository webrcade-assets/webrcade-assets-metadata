A classic 90s FMV game that pushes the Saturn's video capabilities with full-screen, high-quality traditional animation. Players must navigate a sprawling, trap-filled mansion, making choices at every junction to outrun the relentless, hook-handed Fritz. The game is famous for its non-linear structure, allowing players to explore the castle in various orders, and its high level of difficulty due to the precision required for the quick-time events.
