The Japanese release of Bullfrog's classic business simulation. Players are tasked with designing, building, and managing a successful amusement park from the ground up. You must balance finances, staff morale, and guest happiness while researching newer, more death-defying rides. This version features localized text and a tailored UI that brings the deep management mechanics—including the infamous ability to adjust the amount of salt on the fries to sell more soda—to the Japanese Saturn audience.
