The dramatic conclusion to the Blue Destiny trilogy. This volume features the final showdown between the experimental Mobile Suits and resolves the plot involving the EXAM system. It contains the most challenging missions in the series, featuring large-scale battles and high-stakes dogfights. Completion of all three volumes provides a comprehensive and satisfying Gundam narrative that was unique to the Saturn. Its high-fidelity 3D graphics (for the time) made it a standout action title in Japan.
