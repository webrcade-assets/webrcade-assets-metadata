The Japanese version of Sega's premier track-and-field arcade game. Players select one of several international athletes to compete in ten events, from the 100m dash to the grueling 1500m run. The game uses a simple two-button control scheme but requires extreme rhythm and endurance. The Saturn port is virtually identical to the ST-V arcade original, featuring vibrant, large-scale character sprites and smooth 3D environments.
