The second half of the atmospheric adventure known as Lunacy in the West. Fred's journey takes him beyond the gates of Misty Town and into the surreal City of Moons. This disc contains the more challenging inventory puzzles and the game's dramatic conclusion, which changes based on the player's interactions with the townspeople. The pre-rendered 3D environments are highly detailed for the era, creating a unique sense of gothic isolation and mystery that persists until the final credits.
