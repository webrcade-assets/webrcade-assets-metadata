A refined European revision of the original WipEout. This version features several technical optimizations that improve the frame rate stability on PAL hardware. The core gameplay—a high-stakes blend of extreme speed and tactical weapon use—remains one of the most addictive experiences on the console. Players must master the 'air brake' mechanic to navigate the game's tight, challenging corners. This version is prized for its crisp visuals and its role in establishing the WipEout series as a dominant force in the futuristic racing genre during the mid-90s.
