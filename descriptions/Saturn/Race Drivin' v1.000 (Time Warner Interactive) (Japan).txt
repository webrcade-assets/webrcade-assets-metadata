A home port of Atari's follow-up to Hard Drivin', focusing on high-difficulty stunt driving. The game features flat-shaded polygonal environments and a unique physics model that attempts to simulate the weight of a real car. Players must navigate loop-the-loops and jumps while maintaining control of their vehicle. The Saturn version is a faithful port of the arcade original, providing a nostalgic look at the early days of 3D racing simulators and the technical challenges of the era.
