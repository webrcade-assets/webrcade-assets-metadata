The second half of the German release of 'D'. Players must navigate the final challenges of the castle, culminating in one of the system's most famous and disturbing endings. The game's focus on the 'uncanny valley' of its 1995-era CGI and the slow, deliberate pace created a unique psychological horror experience that differs significantly from more action-oriented titles like Resident Evil.
