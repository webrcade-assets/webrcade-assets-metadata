The launch title that changed gaming forever. Virtua Fighter was the first 3D polygonal fighting game, and this initial Japanese release brought the arcade revolution to the home. Featuring flat-shaded character models and a simple three-button control scheme (Punch, Kick, Guard), the game emphasizes realistic physics and timing. The Japanese version is highly prized for its historical significance and its faithful adherence to the Model 1 arcade original, offering a pure and uncompromising look at the dawn of the 3D fighting era.
