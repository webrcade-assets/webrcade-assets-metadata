A humorous point-and-click adventure game based on the animated series created by Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame). Players control Flicker, a young dragon who wants to become a knight to win the heart of Princess Flame. The game features high-quality hand-drawn animation and voice acting, with this German version preserving the witty humor and parody of Arthurian legend found in the original scripts.
