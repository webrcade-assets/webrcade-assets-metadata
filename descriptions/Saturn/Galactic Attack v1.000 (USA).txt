The North American release of RayForce, one of the most highly-regarded shmups on the Saturn. The game is known for its cinematic transitions between stages, as the camera seamlessly pans from space down to the planet's surface. It features a memorable soundtrack and a high level of challenge that requires players to master the lock-on mechanic for high scores. It remains a definitive example of Taito's mastery of the genre during the 1990s.
