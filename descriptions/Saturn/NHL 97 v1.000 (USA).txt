The North American release of NHL 97 was a major technical showcase for EA on the Saturn. By moving to 3D player models, the game allowed for more dynamic camera angles and a better sense of depth on the rink. It features a deep 'Season' mode, player trades, and a robust 'Create-a-Player' feature. The game is remembered for its fast-paced, hard-hitting gameplay and its ability to capture the excitement of professional hockey with realistic crowd noise and PA announcements.
