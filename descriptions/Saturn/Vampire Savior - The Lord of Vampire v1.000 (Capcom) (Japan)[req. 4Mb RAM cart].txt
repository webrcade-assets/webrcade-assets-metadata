The third and final main entry in the Darkstalkers series, Vampire Savior is a technical tour-de-force on the Saturn. This game **requires the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge** to run, allowing it to display a level of animation frames and sprite detail that was previously only possible in the arcades. It features a unique 'Damage Gauge' system where rounds do not reset health, leading to fast-paced and aggressive matches. It is widely considered one of the finest 2D fighters ever made, featuring an incredible roster and iconic gothic-anime art design.
