A sequel to Heretic, Hexen is a dark fantasy FPS that allows players to choose between three character classes: the Fighter, the Cleric, or the Mage. Each class has unique weapons and stats, changing how the player approaches combat. The game is known for its complex 'hub-based' level design, where actions in one level can trigger changes in another. The Saturn version, ported by Probe, features impressive atmospheric effects and remains a solid way to experience this PC classic's moody, gothic world on a console.
