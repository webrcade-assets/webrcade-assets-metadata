Volume 5 of the Capcom Generations series, dedicated to the Street Fighter II legacy. It contains the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, Street Fighter II': Champion Edition, and Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting. This collection is prized for offering arcade-faithful renditions of the CPS1 classics without the compromises found in earlier 16-bit console ports.
