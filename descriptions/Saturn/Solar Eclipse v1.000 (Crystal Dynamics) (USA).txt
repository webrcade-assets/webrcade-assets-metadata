Solar Eclipse is a cinematic space shooter that places players in the cockpit of a high-tech fighter ship to repel an alien invasion. The game uses a mix of pre-rendered FMV backgrounds and real-time 3D objects, creating a fast-paced 'tunnel-shooter' experience. It features high production values with a story told through live-action cutscenes. The US version is known for its intense difficulty and its diverse range of planetary environments, from volcanic landscapes to icy caverns, all while maintaining a smooth and responsive arcade feel.
