The second disc of the Japanese Last Bronx release is a treasure trove for fans. It includes a massive 'Survival' mode, a training mode with move lists, and an extensive 'Glossary' and gallery featuring character backstories and production art. It also includes unique 'interviews' with the characters and high-quality CG movies. This disc effectively turned the arcade port into a comprehensive home package, expanding the lore of the Tokyo street gangs significantly.
