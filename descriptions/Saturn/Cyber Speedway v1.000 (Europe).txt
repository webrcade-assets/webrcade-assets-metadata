Known as Gran Chaser in Japan, Cyber Speedway is a futuristic hover-racing game featuring vehicles designed by the legendary Syd Mead. Set on various alien planets, the game features high-speed racing through 3D tunnels and over complex terrain. A unique aspect is the story mode, which features hand-drawn character art and a narrative involving political intrigue in a galactic racing circuit. The gameplay emphasizes 'drafting' and the use of turbos to navigate the tight, challenging tracks.
