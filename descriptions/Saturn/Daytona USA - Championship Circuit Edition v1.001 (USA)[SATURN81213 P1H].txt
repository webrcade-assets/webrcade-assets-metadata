A significantly upgraded version of the Saturn's original launch title, this edition addresses many of the graphical complaints of the first port. It features a much more stable frame rate, reduced pop-in, and the inclusion of new tracks and playable cars (including a horse). It also features a completely new soundtrack and a two-player split-screen mode. This version is widely considered the technical peak of the Daytona series on the original Saturn hardware.
