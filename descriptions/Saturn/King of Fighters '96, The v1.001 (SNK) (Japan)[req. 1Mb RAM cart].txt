A landmark entry in the SNK crossover series, KOF '96 refined the gameplay with the introduction of short hops, rolls, and new move sets for almost every character. This Saturn port is famous for its use of the 1MB RAM expansion cartridge, which allows it to maintain nearly all the animation frames from the Neo Geo arcade original. It features a massive roster of 27 characters and an epic soundtrack. The Saturn version is widely considered superior to the PlayStation port due to its faster loading times and smoother animation.
