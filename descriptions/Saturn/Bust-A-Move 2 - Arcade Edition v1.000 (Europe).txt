A pixel-perfect port of the arcade puzzle sensation. Players fire colored bubbles from a launcher at the bottom of the screen to match three or more of the same color and clear them. The 'Arcade Edition' includes the full puzzle mode from the arcade, a versus mode against the computer or a friend, and a massive set of 2D and 3D-style backgrounds. Its simple yet strategic gameplay has made it one of the most enduring puzzle games on the system.
