Madden 98 was the final entry of the series for the Sega Saturn. It features updated rosters for the 1997 season and refined gameplay mechanics, particularly in the passing and tackling physics. The graphics were polished to reduce the 'pixelation' of the player sprites, and the AI was significantly toughened to provide a greater challenge for veterans. It remains a high-water mark for 2D/3D hybrid sports games, offering the most content-complete football experience on the system.
