A tactical wargame set in the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. Unlike Koei’s management-heavy simulations, this title focuses more on the tactical battles themselves. Players move units across detailed 2D maps and engage in combat that features large sprites and cinematic special moves for the legendary generals. It features a unique narrative structure that follows the Rise of the Dragon, offering a fresh take on the classic history. The Saturn version is noted for its clean 2D presentation and accessible tactical menus.
