A landmark 2D fighter from Capcom featuring the iconic Marvel mutants. Children of the Atom introduced the high-flying, 'super-jump' combat that would eventually become the foundation of the Marvel vs. Capcom series. The Saturn version is a very faithful arcade port, featuring massive, beautifully animated sprites and screen-filling special moves. The European release is highly regarded for its fast-paced action and its authentic recreation of the 90s X-Men aesthetic, including original voice acting and iconic music tracks for characters like Cyclops and Wolverine.
