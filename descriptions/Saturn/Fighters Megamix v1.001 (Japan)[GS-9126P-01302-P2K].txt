The ultimate crossover fighter from Sega AM2, Fighters Megamix combines the rosters of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers into a single arena. This initial Japanese release features a staggering amount of content, including hidden characters from other Sega franchises like Daytona USA and Sonic the Hedgehog (Bean and Bark). It utilizes the Fighting Vipers engine, meaning characters can have their armor broken and can be knocked through the walls of the cage-match arenas.
