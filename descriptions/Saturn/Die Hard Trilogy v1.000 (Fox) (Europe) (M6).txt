Die Hard Trilogy contains three distinct games based on the first three Die Hard films, each in a different genre. The first is a 3rd-person shooter set in Nakatomi Plaza, the second is a light-gun shooter set in an airport, and the third is a high-speed driving game set in New York City. The European version features multi-language support and captures the high-energy action of the movies. It offers incredible variety and value, effectively being three full games on a single disc.
