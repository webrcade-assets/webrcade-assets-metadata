The sequel to Sega's early hit platformer, Bug Too! introduces two new playable characters, Maggot and Superfly, alongside the returning Bug. The game features 3D environments where players can walk on walls and ceilings, effectively rotating the camera to change the perspective of the stage. The game is heavily themed around parodies of Hollywood films and features significantly improved graphics and larger, more complex boss battles compared to the original.
