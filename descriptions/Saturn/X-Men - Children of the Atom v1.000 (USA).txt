The North American release of Capcom's mutant-themed fighter. This version pioneered the 'Tech-Hit' system and the inclusion of multiple levels of super moves. Players can choose from X-Men heroes and classic villains like Juggernaut and Magneto. The Saturn version is widely considered superior to the PlayStation port due to its faster loading times and its ability to handle more animation frames, providing a smooth and arcade-accurate experience that was essential for serious fighting game fans in the mid-90s.
