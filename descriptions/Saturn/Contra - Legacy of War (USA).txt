Developed by Appaloosa Interactive, this entry moves the Contra series into a 3D isometric perspective. It was the first Contra game developed specifically for 32-bit consoles. It features 3D environments and supports the anaglyph 3D glasses mode, though it is often noted for departing from the side-scrolling roots of the series.
