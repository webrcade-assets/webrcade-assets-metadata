Released during the height of 'Nomomania,' this baseball title features the legendary pitcher Hideo Nomo on the cover. It is essentially the Japanese localized version of Sega's World Series Baseball, featuring MLB teams and players. The game is praised for its 'batting' perspective, which places the camera directly behind the plate for a realistic view of the pitch. It includes full season modes and detailed stat tracking, serving as a high-quality baseball sim for the Japanese market that focused on the American major leagues.
