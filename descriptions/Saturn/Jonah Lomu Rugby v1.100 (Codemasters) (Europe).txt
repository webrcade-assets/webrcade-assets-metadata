Widely considered the best rugby game of its era, Jonah Lomu Rugby brings the intensity of the sport to the Saturn. Featuring the legendary New Zealand All Black Jonah Lomu on the cover, the game offers a realistic simulation of scrums, line-outs, and tackles. It is famous for its humorous and enthusiastic commentary by Bill McLaren and Bill Beaumont. The game’s 2D sprites on 3D fields allow for fast, fluid gameplay that captures the sheer power and pace of the sport, particularly when playing with the powerhouse Lomu himself.
