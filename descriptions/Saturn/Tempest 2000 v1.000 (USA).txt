A high-octane reimagining of the arcade classic, Tempest 2000 is a 'tube-shooter' that bombards the player with psychedelic visuals and a legendary techno soundtrack. Players move around the edge of geometric webs, blasting enemies as they crawl up from the center. This North American version on the Saturn features refined graphics over the Jaguar original and adds multiple game modes, including Tempest Plus and Tempest 2000. It is a visceral, trippy experience that rewards high-speed reflexes and is widely considered one of the best arcade updates ever made.
