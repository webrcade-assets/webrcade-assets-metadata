The sequel to the Sega CD hit, Thunderhawk 2 (known as Firestorm in Europe) is an arcade-style helicopter combat game. Players pilot a high-tech gunship through 3D environments, engaging ground and air targets with a variety of missiles and a chain gun. The game features 28 missions set across the globe, including the Panama Canal and the Middle East. It is praised for its high frame rate and the destructive power the player feels while unleashing a full payload on enemy bases.
