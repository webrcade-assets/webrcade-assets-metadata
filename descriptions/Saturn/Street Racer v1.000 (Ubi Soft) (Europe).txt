Street Racer is a quirky, character-based racing game that blends high-speed competition with combat mechanics. Players select from a roster of eccentric international racers, each with a vehicle that has unique offensive and defensive abilities. The game features a variety of modes, including a 'Soccer' mode and a battle arena. This European release is noted for its smooth split-screen multiplayer (supporting up to 8 players via multitap in some versions) and its colorful, 2.5D visual style. It is a fun and chaotic alternative to traditional kart racers.
