An arcade-style tank shooter played from a top-down isometric perspective. Players choose from three different tanks (tracked, wheeled, or hover) and complete mission objectives across varied terrain including snow, desert, and urban cities. The gameplay is all about 'Mass Destruction'—almost every building and tree in the game can be blown up. The European version features a smooth frame rate and frantic combat, where managing secondary weapons like mortars and flamethrowers is the key to surviving waves of enemy forces.
