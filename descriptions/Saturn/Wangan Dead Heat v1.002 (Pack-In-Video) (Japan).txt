The original release of the Wangan street racing hit. As one of the first major racers on the system, it focuses on high-speed drifting and managing traffic on the narrow highway lanes. The game features a unique 'rival' system where you must earn the respect of other drivers to unlock new parts and challenges. This version is prized for its authentic soundtrack and its grit-heavy presentation of the Tokyo underground racing scene. It remains a defining title for the Saturn's racing library in Japan, capturing the fervor of the 'Wangan Midnight' era.
