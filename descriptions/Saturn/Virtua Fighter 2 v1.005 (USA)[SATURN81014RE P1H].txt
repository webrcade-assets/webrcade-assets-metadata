A refined North American revision of Virtua Fighter 2. This version addresses several minor graphical glitches and improves the AI behavior in the higher difficulty settings. The core experience—a pixel-perfect translation of the complex martial arts combat found in the arcades—remains intact. It serves as the definitive Western release of the game, providing a smooth and highly competitive experience that showcased the Saturn as the premier home for serious fighting game enthusiasts during the 32-bit era.
