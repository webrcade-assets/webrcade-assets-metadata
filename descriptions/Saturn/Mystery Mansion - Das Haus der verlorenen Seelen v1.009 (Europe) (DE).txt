The German-localized version of Mansion of Hidden Souls. This first-person adventure game follows a boy named Jonathan who enters a haunted mansion to save his sister from being turned into a butterfly. The game is essentially an interactive ghost story, focusing on exploration and interacting with the mansion's spectral inhabitants. This version features localized German voice acting and text, preserving the melancholic and mysterious tone of the original Japanese script within its pre-rendered 3D corridors.
