Derby Analyst is a niche horse-racing simulation that focuses heavily on the statistics and 'form' of racing horses. Unlike more action-oriented titles, this game is aimed at the serious fan of Japanese horse racing, featuring a robust database of horses and tracks. Players act as a manager and bettor, analyzing data to predict winners. The Saturn version utilizes the CD-ROM format to store vast amounts of historical data and features video replays of famous real-world races.
