StarFighter 3000 is an advanced 3D flight shooter where players pilot a highly customizable fighter craft across alien worlds. The game features impressive 3D environments with rolling terrain and atmospheric lighting. Players must complete various objectives, such as destroying ground bases and fending off enemy interceptors, while managing their ship's energy and weapons. The European 'M5' version features multi-language support and is noted for its high frame rate and the strategic depth of its ship-upgrade system, offering a serious alternative to more arcade-leaning flight games.
