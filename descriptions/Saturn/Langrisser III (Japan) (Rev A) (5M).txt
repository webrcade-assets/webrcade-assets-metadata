A prequel to the first two games, Langrisser III introduced a radical shift in gameplay with a 'Semi-Realtime' battle system rather than the traditional turn-based grid. It features lush anime character designs by Satoshi Urushihara and was the first in the series to implement the 'Love Sim' elements, allowing the protagonist to build relationships with female party members that affect the ending.
