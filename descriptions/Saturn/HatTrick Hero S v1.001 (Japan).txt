The Saturn version of Taito's popular arcade soccer series (known as Football Champ in some regions). HatTrick Hero S is an arcade-style soccer game that emphasizes fast-paced action over strict simulation. It is famous for its 'Super Shots' and the ability to perform illegal moves like shoves and jersey-pulling—provided the referee isn't looking. The Saturn version features improved graphics and a variety of international teams, offering a fun and chaotic alternative to the more serious FIFA and Victory Goal titles.
