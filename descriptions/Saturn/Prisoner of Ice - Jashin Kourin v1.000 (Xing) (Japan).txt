Based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Prisoner of Ice is a point-and-click adventure set on a submarine in the Arctic during the onset of World War II. Players must solve puzzles to stop an ancient Cthulhu-esque horror that has been released on the vessel. The Japanese version, 'Jashin Kourin,' features localized text and voiced dialogue. It is prized for its atmospheric 2D art and its tense, cosmic-horror storytelling that blends historical drama with supernatural terror.
