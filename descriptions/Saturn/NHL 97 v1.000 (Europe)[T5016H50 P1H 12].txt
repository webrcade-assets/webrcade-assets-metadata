The 1997 installment of EA's premier hockey series brings fully 3D polygonal players to the ice for the first time on the Saturn. This version features smooth animations for skating, shooting, and goaltending, along with a more realistic physics model for the puck. It includes all NHL teams and logos, plus several international squads. This European release is optimized for 50Hz displays and features the high-energy presentation and professional commentary that became hallmarks of the NHL series.
