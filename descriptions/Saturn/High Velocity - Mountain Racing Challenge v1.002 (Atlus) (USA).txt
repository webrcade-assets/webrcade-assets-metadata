Known as Touge King: the Spirits in Japan, High Velocity focuses on the illegal world of mountain drift racing. Players must master the art of the drift to navigate tight hairpin turns on narrow mountain roads. The game features a variety of customizable Japanese cars and atmospheric night-time racing. The US release by Atlus captures the 'initial D' style vibe perfectly, offering a technical racing experience where mastering the handling of individual cars is the key to conquering the mountain passes.
