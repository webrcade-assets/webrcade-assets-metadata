Developed by the legendary studio ELF, Kakyuusei is a definitive 'lifestyle' dating simulator. Players navigate a high school student's daily life, managing a schedule to attend classes, work part-time jobs, and interact with a large cast of heroines. Disc 1 establishes the story and the first several months of the academic year. The game is celebrated for its beautiful 2D art and the complexity of its branching event system, where your location at specific times of day determines which characters you encounter.
