Defcon 5 is a unique hybrid of first-person exploration and base defense strategy. Set on a deep-space mining installation, players must defend the base against an automated invasion. The gameplay is split between using the base's VDU terminals to manage turrets and resources, and exploring the corridors in 3D to fend off invaders with a pulse rifle. It features a high level of immersion, as players must navigate the realistic layout of the base to survive the multi-day siege.
