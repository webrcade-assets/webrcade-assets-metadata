Darklight Conflict is an intense 3D space combat simulator where players take on the role of a human pilot abducted by an alien race to fight in their interstellar war. The game features a first-person cockpit view and highly detailed 3D ship models for its time. Across multiple missions, players engage in dogfights, escort missions, and massive capital ship assaults. The game is praised for its high frame rate and the sense of scale in its space battles, offering an arcade-like alternative to the more complex Wing Commander series.
