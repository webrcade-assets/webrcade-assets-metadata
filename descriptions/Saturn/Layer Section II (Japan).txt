The sequel to Layer Section (known as RayStorm in arcades/PS1). This installment shifts from 2D sprites to 3D polygonal graphics while maintaining the classic vertical shooting gameplay. It retains the signature lock-on laser system of its predecessor but introduces special attacks and new ship types. The Saturn version is a unique port that uses the console's hardware to recreate the 3D visuals, differing slightly in texture quality from the PlayStation version.
