A comedic 'Dragon's Lair' style interactive cartoon. Players control Lance, a young computer repairman who is chased through a castle by a crazed mad scientist and his henchman, Fritz. The Japanese version features full localized voice acting. Success depends on making split-second directional or action choices during fast-paced animation sequences to avoid one of dozens of creatively gruesome death scenes.
