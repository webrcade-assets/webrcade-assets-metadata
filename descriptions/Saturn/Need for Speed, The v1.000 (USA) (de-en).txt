The North American release of The Need for Speed brings a high level of simulation to the Saturn's racing library. Unlike the arcade-heavy Daytona, this title emphasizes engine sounds, realistic cockpits, and accurate handling models. The game's 3D engine features impressive scenery and lighting effects for 1996. It remains a definitive early-3D racer, capturing the 'luxury car' fantasy with its polished presentation and challenging AI that requires careful driving and tactical use of the car's power.
