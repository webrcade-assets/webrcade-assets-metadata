The Japanese version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. This game expanded the roster to 18 characters and introduced the 'Custom Combo' system, which allows players to create their own rapid-fire chains of attacks. The Saturn version is a masterclass in 2D porting, featuring massive, beautiful sprites and detailed, interactive backgrounds. It includes exclusive content like an arranged soundtrack and a robust training mode. It is widely considered one of the finest 2D fighting games ever made, perfectly capturing the peak of Capcom's mid-90s arcade dominance.
