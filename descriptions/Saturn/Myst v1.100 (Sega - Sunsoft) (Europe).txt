The European multi-language release of Myst. As the 'Stranger,' players find a book that transports them to a surreal island filled with mechanical wonders and ancient libraries. This version is prized for its clean interface and atmospheric presentation. The game's non-linear structure allows players to tackle the various 'Ages' (worlds) in any order, with the Saturn's internal memory providing a convenient way to manage the long-term progress required to reach the game's multiple endings.
