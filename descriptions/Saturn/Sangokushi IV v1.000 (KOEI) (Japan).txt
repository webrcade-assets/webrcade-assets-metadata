Known as Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire in the West, this is Koei's premier historical simulation based on the Chinese classic novel. Players take control of a ruler during the fall of the Han Dynasty, managing every aspect of their kingdom from agriculture and trade to military diplomacy and warfare. The Saturn version features an updated interface, CD-quality music, and high-resolution portraits for the hundreds of historical officers. It is a deep, slow-paced simulation that rewards long-term planning and tactical brilliance.
