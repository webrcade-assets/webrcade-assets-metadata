This European multi-language release provides a comprehensive version of the park management hit. The Saturn port is notable for its colorful graphics and smooth cursor movement, which was optimized for the console's controller. Beyond simple construction, players must handle micro-management aspects like negotiating staff wages and monitoring stock levels for individual shops. It remains a definitive 'god-game' simulation on the system, offering a long-term challenge as you expand your park empire globally.
