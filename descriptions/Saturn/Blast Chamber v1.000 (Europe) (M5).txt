Set in a dystopian future game show, players are equipped with a ticking time bomb and placed inside a rotating 3D cube. The objective is to grab a crystal and reach the reactor to reset your timer before it explodes. The unique hook is the ability to kick walls to rotate the entire room, using gravity to move yourself and obstacles. It features a frantic four-player multiplayer mode where players compete to survive the longest.
