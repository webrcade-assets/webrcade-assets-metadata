Sky Target is an arcade-style flight combat game that serves as a spiritual successor to After Burner. Players pilot modern fighter jets like the F-14D Super Tomcat through intense, high-speed rail-shooting missions. The game features branching paths and massive, screen-filling boss encounters, including futuristic flying fortresses. The Saturn version is noted for its fast-paced action and the inclusion of various unlockable planes, delivering a pure arcade experience with a rock-heavy soundtrack that matches the intensity of the aerial dogfights.
