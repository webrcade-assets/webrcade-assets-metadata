Virtua Fighter Kids is a charming and fast-paced spin-off that reimagines the VF2 roster as 'super-deformed' (chibi) children with massive heads. The gameplay is based on the Virtua Fighter 2 engine but features a faster tempo and simplified controls. It includes unique, humorous animations and kid-themed arenas. The European version is noted for its vibrant graphics and the inclusion of a 'Saturn Mode' with various unlockables. It is a fun and accessible alternative to the more serious main series, offering a surprisingly deep combat system behind its cute exterior.
