One of Treasure's most legendary titles and a holy grail for Saturn collectors. Radiant Silvergun is a vertical shmup that gives players access to seven different weapons from the start, which level up as they are used. The game features a complex 'scoring by color' system and massive, screen-filling bosses with intricate attack patterns. It is famous for its high-quality anime cutscenes and a philosophical storyline. It remains one of the most technically and mechanically deep shooters ever made for any system.
