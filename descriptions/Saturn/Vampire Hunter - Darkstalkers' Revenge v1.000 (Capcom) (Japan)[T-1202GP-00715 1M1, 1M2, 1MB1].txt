The Japanese title for the second Darkstalkers game. It features a roster of supernatural monsters including the vampire Demitri and the succubus Morrigan. The game is legendary for its 'Hunter Chain' combo system and its fluid, frame-heavy animation. The Saturn version is a near-perfect port of the CPS2 arcade original, utilizing the console's superior 2D capabilities to deliver large, colorful sprites and high-speed combat. This version is prized for its high-resolution art and its role in establishing the Saturn as the premier platform for 2D fighting fans.
