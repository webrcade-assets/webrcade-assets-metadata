Dragon Force is a unique blend of grand strategy and real-time tactical combat. Players choose one of eight monarchs to unite the continent of Legendra. The game is famous for its massive battles, where up to 200 individual soldiers clash on screen simultaneously. Outside of battle, players manage their generals, build fortifications, and engage in diplomacy. The European release is highly sought after, as it features a high-quality localization that preserves the epic scale and character-driven story.
