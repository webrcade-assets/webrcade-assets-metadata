A spin-off of the massive Tokimeki Memorial dating sim franchise, Taisen Pazurudama is a competitive 'falling object' puzzle game. Players match colored orbs to clear their board and send 'garbage' to their opponent, all while interacting with the popular cast of heroines from the main series. The Saturn version features high-quality 2D character sprites and voiced dialogue during matches. This specific revision is highly sought after for its polished balance and its role as one of the best competitive puzzle games on the system.
