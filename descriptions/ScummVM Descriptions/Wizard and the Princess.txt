Wizard and the Princess, marketed as Hi-Res Adventure #2: Wizard and the Princess, is a text adventure game with graphics.  A barbarian is sent back in time by the wizard Harlin to stop his defeat, but becomes the wanderer of legend who is destined to defeat the wizard and save the princess.  The DOS version was titled Adventure in Serenia.  Other than a lower color palette, an improved parser and a few changes in dialog, there is little difference between this version and the original.
