The Fun Seeker's Guide to Eastern Madera County was a joke program created by Doug Oldfield, a programmer on Space Quest III and Space Quest IV.  It is a parody of the Fun Seeker's books that show popular tourist locations.  This program had humourous descriptions of some of the tourist locations around the area where the Sierra offices were located, including the Sierra building itself.
