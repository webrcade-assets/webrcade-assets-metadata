Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out! was the fifth game in the Leisure Suit Larry series.  The game finds Larry alone again, with no explanation as to Patti's disappearance.  He competes on the game show 'Stallions'... and loses, but gets a runner-up prize of a trip to 'La Costa Lotta' health spa. As with previous games, the aim is to seduce various women at the spa in various ways so Larry can meet the girl of his dreams.
