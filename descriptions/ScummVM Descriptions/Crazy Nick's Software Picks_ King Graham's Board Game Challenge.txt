Crazy Nick's Software Picks: King Graham's Board Game Challenge was part of Sierra's Crazy Nick's Software Picks line of budget games. The Crazy Nick's Software Picks games usually bundled the arcade game minigames from their game releases. King Graham's Board Game Challenge was the exception, since the games were not included in a King's Quest title.  The player can choose to play one of two games: checkers or backgammon. The object is to beat the computer-AI controlled King Graham more times than he beats you. The player can choose between beginner, medium, or expert difficulty.
