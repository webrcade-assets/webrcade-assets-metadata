Hoyle Classic Card Games is the fourth in the Hoyle series of licensed computer game simulations of popular non-electronic games.  This volume returns to the card games found in the first volume.  Along with the card games found in the first game: Crazy Eights, Old Maid, Hearts, Gin Rummy, Cribbage and Klondike, the game also included Bridge and Euchre.  Several computer-AI controlled opponent players were based on developers at Sierra, and characters from previous Sierra adventure games.  This version also included an interface tutorial and a glossary of game specific terms.
