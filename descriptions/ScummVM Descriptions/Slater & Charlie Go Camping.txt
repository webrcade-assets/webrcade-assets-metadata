Slater & Charlie Go Camping is an educational adventure game by Sierra.  The game stars Slater, the 'petrosaur' from Sierra's 1990 remake of their 1983 game Oil's Well.  Slater has another dinosaur friend named Charlie, and the two decide to go on a camping trip together.  The game is presented as a series of still images with text at the bottom of the screen detailing each scene.  There is an option to have the text narrated by a voice for children who are not old enough to read or for those who have trouble reading.
