Astro Chicken was the arcade game by the fictional company ScumSoft in Space Quest III.  It was released as a standalone game as a demo teaser for Space Quest III.  The object of the game is to get Astro Chicken to land on the landing pad.  Press up to flap Astro Chicken's wings, press left to move left, right to move right, and down to stop left/right movement.  If you hit the landing pad too fast, you'll bounce off.  If you miss the landing pad, you'll explode.  If you fly too high, you'll bounce off the atmosphere and fall back to the planet's surface.  There is a chicken feed meter in the left hand corner.  If you run out of chicken feed, Astro Chicken will no longer be able to flap his wings.
