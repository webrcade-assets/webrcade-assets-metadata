Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Leisure Suit Larry's Casino was part of Sierra's Crazy Nick's Software Picks line of budget games, not to be confused with the 1998 release Leisure Suit Larry's Casino.  The Crazy Nick's Software Picks games usually bundled the arcade game mini-games from their game releases.  This bundle contains three casino-themed mini-games from Leisure Suit Larry 5: slot machine, black jack, and poker.
