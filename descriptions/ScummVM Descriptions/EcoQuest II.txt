EcoQuest II: Lost Secret of the Rainforest is the second in a series of two adventure games designed to teach children the importance of protecting the environment.  The game is set after the events of the previous game, where Adam's gift of speaking to animals is now commonplace.  Adam and his ecologist father travel to a rainforest to conduct ecological studies.  After Adam becomes separated from his father, he searches for a way to keep the rainforest from destruction, and he also searches for a cure for an illness that has affected the Grove people, a tribe native to the rainforest.
