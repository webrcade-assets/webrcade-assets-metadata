Mission Asteroid, marketed as Hi-Res Adventure #0: Mission Asteroid, is a text adventure game with graphics.  Despite being marketed with a number above the rest of the games in the Hi-Res Adventure series, it was actually the third game in that series.  It received a lower number, as it was meant to be an introduction to the adventure genre, since it was easier than the other games in the series.  An astronaut is tasked with making a flight plan to send a rocket up to an asteroid to destroy it before it reaches Earth.
