Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb was the first game to use The Dreamers Guild's SAGA engine.  The game takes place in the future, where humans are extinct, and talking human-like animals populate the earth.  The game follows Rif of the fox tribe, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend Rhene and clear his name after he is accused of stealing the Orb of Storms, a magical orb that predicts the weather.
