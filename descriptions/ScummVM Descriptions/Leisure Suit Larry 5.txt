Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does Some Undercover Work was the fourth game in the Leisure Suit Larry series.  Due to the fact that the third game in the series wrapped up the games in the way Al Lowe had originally envisioned, he purposely skipped the fourth game in the series.  The plot of the game would actually include that fact, in that the game starts with Julius Biggs stealing the 'missing floppies' of LSL 4, leaving Larry amnesiac.  Larry now works for a porn production company, and must travel across the United States to find three girls to star in a new television show, and then to ultimately regain his lost memory.
