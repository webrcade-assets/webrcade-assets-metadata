Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness is the fourth game in the Quest for Glory series.  In this adventure/RPG hybrid, the hero is transported directly from his victory in Tarna to the dark caves in the distant land of Mordavia.  The hero has no equipment and no idea why he has been sent here.  He ultimately gets himself back into fighting shape, and is helped several times by a young woman named Katrina.  He has to battle with several of his previous foes, and ultimately becomes part of a plot to summon a great power.
