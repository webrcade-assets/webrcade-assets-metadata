The Secret of Monkey Island was the first game in the Monkey Island series, and the fifth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. At first, the game follows Guybrush's attempts to prove himself a pirate; later, he attempts to rescue his new-found love, Elaine Marley, from the clutches of the ghost pirate LeChuck.
