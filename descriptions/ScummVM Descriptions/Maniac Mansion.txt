Maniac Mansion was the first game to use the SCUMM scripting language, which is in fact an acronym for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion.  The game follows Dave Miller and a group of his friends as they break into a strange mansion in an attempt to rescue Dave's girlfriend Sandy and stop the evil purple meteor from taking over the world.   The game has a group of six characters to choose from (Dave must always be in your party), and multiple possible endings. It belongs to Maniac Mansion series.
