SPY Fox in Hold the Mustard is an arcade game in the SPY Fox series. Unlike the other SPY Fox games, this one is a vertical side-scroller where SPY Fox must use his M.E.S.S. (Multiple Environment Spy Ship) to travel through 101 levels over different terrains (water, land, space and air) to save the world's ketchup supply.
