Gobliiins is the first game in the goblins adventure puzzle series.  It is a mixture of an adventure game and a puzzle game.  In the game, there a three different goblins who all have their own unique skill.  One goblin is strong, and can be used to break things and knock things over.  Another goblin can use magic to change the physical attributes of objects, or to simply move objects.  The last goblin is the only goblin that can pick up and use objects.  You must use each of the goblins to get through each stage.  The game has a life meter that goes down when the goblins get hurt.
