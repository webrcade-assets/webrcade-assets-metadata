The Dark Crystal, marketed as Hi-Res Adventure #6: The Dark Crystal, is a text adventure game with graphics, closely based on Jim Henson's film of the same name.   You play as Jen, the last survivor of the Gelflings, a race of mole-like people of a distant world. You must find the dark crystal and its broken shard, and repair it to end the reign of evil from the land. The original release used the ADL engine.
