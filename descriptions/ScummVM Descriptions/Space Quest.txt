Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter was the first game in the Space Quest series.  The game follows a janitor on board the scientific spaceship Arcada.  After waking from an on-duty nap in a broom closet, he discovers that an evil alien race called the Sariens stole the Star Generator, an experimental weapon that was being held on board, and killed all of the Arcada's crew members.
