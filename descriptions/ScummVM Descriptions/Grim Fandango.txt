Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts adventure game to not use the SCUMM scripting language.  Instead, it used an engine called GrimE (Grim Engine), which was based upon the Lua open-source scripting language.  The game follows Manny Calavera, a grim reaper for the Department of Death in the Land of the Dead.  He learns that the system he works for is corrupt, after a woman who led a great life, Mercedes (Meche) Colomar, doesn't get to go straight to the seventh level of the afterlife, the land of eternal rest.  Manny must take a four-year journey to find out who's behind the corruption, find Meche, and earn himself a place in the land of eternal rest.
