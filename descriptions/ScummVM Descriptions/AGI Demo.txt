The demo for each game is selectable via a menu by pressing the number key that corresponds to the desired demo.  Three game names are shown at a time.  Pressing F10 shows the next 3 game names.  Each demo contains selected scenes from each game, with a text narration detailing the plot and features of the games.  Once a demo from one game is completed, the menu screen returns and another demo can be selected.
