Beneath a Steel Sky uses a variant of Revolution's virtual theatre engine. The game takes place in the future, after the world is damaged from the ravages of humankind. The game first follows Robert Foster as he tries to escape from an enclosed city after he was kidnapped and brought there from his home in the Australian outback. Later, Robert discovers a plot involving the death of his mother, a government coverup, and the secrets about his own father.
