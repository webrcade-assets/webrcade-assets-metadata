Ultima VIII: Pagan was a game in the Ultima series of role-playing games. After the defeat of Batlin on Serpent Isle, the Guardian banishes the Avatar to Pagan, a world that is in eternal twilight. The magic system of Pagan is entirely different from that of Britannia, so the Avatar must learn the elemental magic of the Titans, which allows the Avatar to produce thunderstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and meteor showers. After mastering them all, the Avatar can travel to the Ethereal Plane to defeat the Titans and construct a gate to return home to Britannia.
