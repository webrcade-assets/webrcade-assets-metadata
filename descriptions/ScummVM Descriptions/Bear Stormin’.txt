Bear Storminâ€™ was originally a mini-game within the game Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon. It was re-released as a standalone demo in 1993. In the game, you are the character Fatty Bear, flying an early 20th century biplane. The objective is to get to the finish line without losing a life; three lives lost and the game is over. You lose a life when the plane hits something or runs out of fuel. Replenish fuel by hitting balloons.
