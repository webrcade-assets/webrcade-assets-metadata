Police Quest SWAT was a follow-up to the Police Quest series, but was a tactical simulator rather than an adventure game.  It employs full motion video (commonly reffered to as FMV) scenes, which are pre-recorded video footage of live actors.  The game puts you in command of a SWAT team.  There are several training simulations followed by three missions.  The outcome of the missions depends on strict adherence to procedure and the reliance on teamwork.
