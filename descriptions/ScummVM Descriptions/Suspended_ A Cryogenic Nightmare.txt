Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare is a science-fiction text adventure by Infocom. The game follows the Central Mentality, a person that is in a state of suspended animation for 500 years. The Central Mentality can only use brain power to control the vital systems in a city such as transportation systems and weather control, as well as control robots by thought to do other tasks. When the city begins to be destroyed, the citizens think the Central Mentality has gone insane, as a previous one had. It's up to the current Central Mentality to repair the damage and restore the systems to normal before being disconnected by a maintenance crew and replaced by a clone.
