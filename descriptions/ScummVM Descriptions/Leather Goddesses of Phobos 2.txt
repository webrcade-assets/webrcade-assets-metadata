Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2 is the second in a series of two adventure games. It's 1958, and astronomers have recently discovered 'Planet X', the tenth planet in our solar system. One night the sleepy town of Atom City witnesses a spaceship that crash-lands with a single survivor: Barth, the 'Pulsating Inconvenience' from the world known as Planet X. The Leather Goddesses have invaded Planet X and forced its inhabitants to become sex slaves. Barth has fled to Earth in a desperate effort to find humans who can help free his planet.
