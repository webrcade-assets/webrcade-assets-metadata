Tender Loving Care was an FMV (full motion video) game.  The player takes the role of an off-screen assistant to a psychiatrist named Dr. Turner.  He investigates the odd circumstances behind a home for sale and the family who live within. All he knows is that, despite the home's beautiful appearance, no one will buy it after something terrible happened there.
