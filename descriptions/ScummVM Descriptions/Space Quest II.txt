Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge was the second game in the Space Quest series.  The game follows Roger Wilco, who is newly appointed to Xenon Orbital Station 4 and promoted to head (and only) janitor.

Roger must make his way to Vohaul's asteroid base and once again stop him from destroying life on the planet Xenon.
