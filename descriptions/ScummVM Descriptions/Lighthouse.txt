Lighthouse: The Dark Being was a first person graphic adventure game by Sierra, with an interface similar to Myst.  A struggling writer just arrived at a cottage on the Oregon coast.  The next door neighbor, Dr. Krick, who lives in a lighthouse, leaves a frantic message on the answering machine asking the writer to come over to watch his daughter Amanda.  Upon arriving, the door to the lighthouse is locked, and it is dark inside.  A 'dark being' takes Amanda and jumps through a portal.  Now, the writer must travel to a parallel world in order to rescue Dr. Krick and his daughter.
