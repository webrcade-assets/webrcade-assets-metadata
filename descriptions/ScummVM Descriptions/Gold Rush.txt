Gold Rush! was an adventure game set in 1848, just before the California gold rush.  The game follows Brooklyn newspaperman Jerrod Wilson, who must go to Sacramento to meet his long-lost brother.  Jerrod must find a way to get from Brooklyn to Sacremento in the midst of a horde of people going from coast to coast in search of gold and inflated prices.
