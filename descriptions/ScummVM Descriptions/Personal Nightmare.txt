Personal Nightmare is the first game in the Elvira series. This adventure-RPG follows the son of a pastor who has to find out who is behind the disappearance of his father and the possession of the townsfolk by demons.
Personal Nightmare was the first game to make use of Horror Soft's new AGOS engine, although the engine used does not resemble any other version of AGOS. 
According to Alan Cox, The Personal Nightmare engine was considered too complicated and was scrapped, later games would use AberMUD5 variants.
Personal Nightmare shares common video scripting code with other AGOS games and due to this, it was included in the AGOS engine.
