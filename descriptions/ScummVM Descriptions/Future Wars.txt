Future Wars (orig. Les Voyageurs du Temps: la Menace), is the first game to use Delphine Software's Cin√©matique evo1 engine.  In this game, a window washer finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two alien races.  He has to travel through time in order to keep the aliens from destroying each other, and he also must save a kidnapped princess in the process.
