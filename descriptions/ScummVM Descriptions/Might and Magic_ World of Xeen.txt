Might and Magic: World of Xeen combines the fourth and fifth Might and Magic games into a single game.  The original release of the fourth and fifth game told a story arc that took place over the two games, and shared character data between them.  This release enabled the storyline of the adventurers quest to restore stability to the land of Xeen to be played continuously.
