Stellaluna was an interactive storybook for children in the Living Books series, created with the Mohawk Living Books player. The book is an interactive version of Janell Cannon's children's book of the same name. An owl knocks a baby bird into a bird's nest, and the mother bird allows the baby bat to stay as long as Stellaluna acts like a bird and not a bat. As the story is read, the objects in the background are clickable.
