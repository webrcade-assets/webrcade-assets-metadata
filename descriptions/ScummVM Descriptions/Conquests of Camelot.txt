Conquests of Camelot: The Search for the Grail is the first of a series of two adventure games set during mythical times.  Conquests of Camelot is set during the decline of King Author's reign of Britain, due to the love triangle between King Author, Queen Guinevere, and Sir Lancelot.  The royal knights Sir Gawain, Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad go on a quest for the holy grail after having a vision of the grail covered in a silver cloth.  The knights never return, so King Author sets off on a quest to find the knights and recover the grail.
