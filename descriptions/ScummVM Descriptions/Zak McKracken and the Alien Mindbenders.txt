Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders was the second game to use the SCUMM scripting language.  The game first follows Zak McKracken, a tabloid reporter who slowly discovers a plot by an alien race to take over the Earth.  Later, the game adds three additional playable characters (a scientist named Annie Larris, and two Yale students named Melissa China and Leslie Bennett), and places the characters on a quest to find the missing pieces of an alien device that will save all of humankind.
