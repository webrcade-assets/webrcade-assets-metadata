Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail! was the sixth game in the Leisure Suit Larry series.  Its working subtitle was 'Yank Hers Away!'.  As usual, Larry is dumped by the woman he met in the last game, Shamara, and is once again alone again.  In this game Larry is the passanger of a cruise ship featuring parodies of real-life people.  The women consisted of 'Drew Baringmore' (Drew Barrymore), 'Dewmi Moore' (Demi Moore), 'Victorian Principles' (Victoria Principal), 'Jamie Lee Coitus' (Jamie Lee Curtis), 'Nailmi' and 'Wydoncha Jugg' (Naomi and Wynonna Judd) and 'Annette Boning' (Annette Bening).  Once again, Larry set out to try to meet and have sex with each of the women on the ship.
