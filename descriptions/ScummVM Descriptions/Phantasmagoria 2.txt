Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh was the second Phantasmagoria game by Sierra.  Curtis Craig, an introverted 26-year old man working at a pharmaceutical company, was released from a mental institution one year ago.  Now, he is seeing disturbing images and seemingly receiving messages to tell him to commit murder.  After a co-worker Curtis doesn't like was murdered, he initially suspects he may have been the murderer due to a psychotic break.  However, when more people at the pharmaceutical company are murdered, Curtis begins to suspect someone else.
