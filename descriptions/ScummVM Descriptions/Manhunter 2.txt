Manhunter 2: San Francisco was the sequel to Manhunter: New York.  Like the first game, the game takes place in the (at the time of release) futuristic setting of 2004.  The uprising of the first game did not stop the Orb invasion of Earth.  In this game, the player must work with the Orbs while secretly plotting against them to free humanity.
