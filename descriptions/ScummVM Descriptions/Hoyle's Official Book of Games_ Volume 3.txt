Hoyle's Official Book of Games: Volume 3 is the third in the Hoyle series of licensed computer game simulations of popular non-electronic games.

The games included were Backgammon, Checkers, Dominoes, Yacht (based on Yahtzee), Pachisi, and Snakes and Ladders.  Since these games were multi-player games, the option to choose Sierra game characters as computer-AI controlled opponents returned.
