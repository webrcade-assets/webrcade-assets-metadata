Uncle Henry's Playhouse is a compilation game featuring puzzles from Trilobyte's previous games, The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour, and Clandestiny.  The main antagonist from Trilobyte's first two games, Henry Stauf, is a toymaker with a dark, twisted imagination that tends to make puzzles that are deadly.  He has created a sadistic dollhouse with twelve rooms featuring puzzles from his previous mansions.  After solving the twelfth puzzle, a thirteenth puzzle is available to play.
