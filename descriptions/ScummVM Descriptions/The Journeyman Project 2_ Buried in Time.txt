The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time is the sequel to The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime (which was itself a remake of the original The Journeyman Project).  It takes place six months after the events of the first game.  Gage is visited by himself from ten years from the future, and is informed that he has been framed for tampering with historical artifacts.  Gage must go through time to find evidence to clear his name.
