Codename: ICEMAN is an adventure game set in the (at the time of release) futuristic setting of the 21st century.  During a global oil shortage, Tunisia is discovered to contain a large oil surplus.  The United States and Soviet Russian governments try to acquire as much oil as they can.  In the middle of this, Soviet-backed terrorists kidnap a US ambassador in hopes of provoking an international incident.  Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent by the Pentagon to meet an agent in Tunisia and work together to free the ambassador.
