The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight was an interactive storybook for children in the Living Books series, created with the Mohawk Living Books player. The book is an interactive version of Stan and Jan Berenstain's children's book of the same name. Even though they usually get along, Brother and Sister Bear have been fighting all day long, and it's up to Mama Bear to set things right.
