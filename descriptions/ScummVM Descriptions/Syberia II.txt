Syberia II or (Syberia 2) is a 2004 graphic adventure game developed and published by MC2-Micro√Øds. As the direct sequel to 2002's Syberia, it is a third-person puzzle-solving game. Although it is stylistically identical, Syberia II improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a recap of the first chapter, so it does not require the player to have experienced the first game.
