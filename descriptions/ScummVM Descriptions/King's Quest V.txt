King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder was the fifth game in the King's Quest series, and the first game to be released exclusively on the SCI engine.  The evil wizard Mordack seeks revenge on Prince Alexander for turning his brother Manannan into a cat in King's Quest III.  He shrinks Daventry castle and everyone inside and imprisons them in a bottle. Mordack threatens to feed the royal family to Manannan unless Prince Alexander can restore him to his former self. King Graham, who was out for a walk when Mordack shrank the castle, is the only one who can break the spell and free his family.
