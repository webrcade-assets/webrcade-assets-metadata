Hoyle's Official Book of Games: Volume 1 is the first in the Hoyle series of licensed computer game simulations of popular non-electronic games.  The first volume featured the multi-player card games Crazy Eights, Old Maid, Hearts, Gin Rummy, Cribbage and Klondike.  Several computer-AI controlled opponent players were based on developers at Sierra, and characters from previous Sierra adventure games.
