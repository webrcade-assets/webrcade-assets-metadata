Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle was the sequel to Maniac Mansion, and the eighth game to use the SCUMM scripting language.  The game first follows the nerd from the first game, Bernard Bernoulli, and his roommates Hoagie and Laverne as they rescue green tentacle from Dr. Fred's basement.  Later, the game follows the trio as they go back in time to stop the evil purple tentacle from changing the past for his own benefit.
