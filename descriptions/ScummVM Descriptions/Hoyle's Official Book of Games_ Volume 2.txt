Hoyle's Official Book of Games: Volume 2 is the second in the Hoyle series of licensed computer game simulations of popular non-electronic games.  The second volume featured 28 different variations of solitaire.  Since solitaire is a single player game, Sierra characters were not available as computer opponents in this game.
