Ms. Astro Chicken: Flight of the Pullet was the arcade game by the fictional company ScumSoft in Space Quest IV.  Like Astro Chicken before it, it was released as a standalone game as a demo teaser for Space Quest III.  The object of the game is to throw eggs at obstacles in Ms. Astro Chicken's way.  Players can use the mouse or the astro keys to control Ms. Astro Chicken.  Pressing enter or the right mouse button makes Ms. Astro Chicken shoot an egg.  Avoid the other obstacles such as windmills and grating that might get in the way.
