Phantasmagoria is a rather large adventure game from Sierra in terms of CDs (7), not necessarily in length. You play Adrienne, who has just moved into an old mansion with her photographer husband Donald. Shortly after moving in, Adrienne begins to experience horrifying nightmares and have odd encounters inside the creepy old abode. Further, the house is having a severe effect on her husband, changing him for the worse and you must discover its secret before he (or the house) kills Adrienne.
