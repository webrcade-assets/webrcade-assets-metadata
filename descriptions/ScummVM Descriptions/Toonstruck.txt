Toonstruck was a FMV (full motion video) adventure game that starred Christopher Lloyd as a human character in a world of cartoons.  He played Drew Blanc, a cartoonist who is tired of drawing and animating the cute characters from his hit show the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun Show.  He would prefer to make a show starring his other character, Flux Wildly, a sarcastic purple creature.  After going to sleep after suffering from writer's block, Drew wakes up the next morning to find his television's been turned on to the Fluffy Fluffy Bun Bun show.  Drew gets sucked into the television, and ends up in the world of his own creation, and finds that Flux Wildly is also in this world.  The world is being twisted by an evil new character, turning the residents of the toon world into cruel, twisted versions of their former selves.  Now Drew and Flux have to discover who's behind the transformations, restore the land to it's former peaceful state, and find a way to get Drew back to his three dimensional world.
