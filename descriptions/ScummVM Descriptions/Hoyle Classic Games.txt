Hoyle Classic Games is the fifth in the Hoyle series of licensed computer game simulations of popular non-electronic games.  This volume is a collection of card games (Draw Poker, Bridge, Cribbage, Gin Rummy, Hearts, Solitaire, Old Maid, and Crazy 8's) and board games (Backgammon, and Checkers). There are different opponents to compete against and they can be selected from a list of business or icons pictures. Each opponent has a bio and a different skill level (beginner, average, or expert). Some games are single-player, while others are played by two or four players.
