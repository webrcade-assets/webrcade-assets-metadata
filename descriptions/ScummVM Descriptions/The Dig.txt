The Dig was the eleventh game to use the SCUMM scripting language.  The game, based on a story by Steven Spielberg, first follows two NASA astronauts (Commander Boston Low, Dr. Ludger Brink) and a reporter named Maggie Robbins as they attempt to destroy an asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth.  Later, the game finds the crew on an alien planet trying to discover why there seems to be no sentient life, discovering the secrets the planet holds, and trying to find a way back home.
