Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero was the first game in the Quest for Glory series. In this adventure/RPG hybrid game, a wanna-be hero travels to the land of Spielburg to save it's people and prove himself worthy of the title of hero. The player can choose out of three classes for the hero: fighter, magic user, and thief. Many of the puzzles that could be solved and quests that would be encountered in the game were dependent on the chosen class of the hero.
