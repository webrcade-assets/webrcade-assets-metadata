The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery was the second game in the Gabriel Knight series.  Unlike the first game, this game is a FMV (full motion video) game.  Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura travel to Germany where Gabriel has inherited a castle and the title of Schattenj√§ger (Shadow Hunter).  The two investigate a case where a young girl was murdered, and the towns people believe she was killed by a werewolf.
