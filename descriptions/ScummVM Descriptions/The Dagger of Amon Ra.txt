The Dagger of Amon Ra was the second game in the Laura Bow series.  The game is set in the 1920's after the events in the previous game.  Laura Bow recently graduated from Tulane University, and has moved to New York City, where she has earned employment at a prestigious newspaper.  Laura's first assignment is to write a story about the benefit held at a local museum to celebrate their new Egyptian exhibit.  When a murder happens at the benefit, she is locked inside with all of the other suspects.  More people begin to die, so now Laura must solve the crimes before the killer either escapes or kills her.
