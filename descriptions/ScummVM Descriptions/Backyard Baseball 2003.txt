Backyard Baseball 2003 was the third game in the Backyard Baseball series of games aimed at recreating the experience of playing baseball as children.  This game continues the tradition from the 2001 version, as it has official licenses from the Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association, and features MLB players portrayed as children.
