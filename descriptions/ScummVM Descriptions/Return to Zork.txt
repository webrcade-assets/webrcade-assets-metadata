Return to Zork is the first point-and-click graphic adventure game in the Zork series.  You are standing behind the white house.  There is something in the mailbox.  A video message from a wizard informing you that you are the sweepstakes winner to the Valley of the Sparrows... right now, by magic flight.  Upon arriving at this mysterious place however, not everything is as it should be.  There's nobody to meet you and those who you do come across don't seem to have any knowledge about a sweepstakes.  It looks like this is a private vacation and you'll need to find your own way through this land.
