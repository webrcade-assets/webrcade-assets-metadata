The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble is a game by Coktel Vision that is similar to the goblins adventure puzzle series, although it isn't considered to be a part of it due to the name and its style. Unlike Gobliins, this is a full-fledged adventure where you can move around freely and interact with many characters.
