Schizm: Mysterious Journey is a first-person point-and-click adventure game where the player plays two scientists that become separated after crash-landing on an alien planet.  Similar to Reah: Face the Unknown, it features panoramic controls, but unlike Reah, the player can switch between the two main characters at almost any time.
