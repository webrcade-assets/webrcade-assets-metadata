Mixed-Up Mother Goose is the first in a series of two adventure games aimed at children.  The player is transported to the dream-like world of Mother Goose, where all of the nursery rhymes have been mixed up.  In order to restore the nursery rhymes, characters and items must be brought back to the appropriate places in which they belong.
