This adaptation of the movie is essentially a side-scrolling action game, with both melee combat and shooting; there are also driving sequences between the side-scrolling levels, which mainly consists of avoiding pursuers and safely arriving to the next destination. T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The "good terminator" can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.
