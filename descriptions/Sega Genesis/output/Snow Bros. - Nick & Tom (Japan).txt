Snow Bros. is a 1990 arcade game which was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. The game follows two snowmen named Nick and Tom, who must defeat all the on-screen enemies by creating giant snowballs. It is built similarly to Bubble Bobble.

The Mega Drive version adds cutscenes to the game, as well as some more background music and several additional levels. This version was only released in Japan and Korea.
