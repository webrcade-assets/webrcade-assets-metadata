Sorcerian is the fifth main game in Falcom's Dragon Slayer series of RPGs, first released for the NEC PC-88 in 1987 before being ported to a variety of other systems. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990  this port was not released outside Japan (the IBM PC port was the only port of the time to be released outside Japan, published by Sierra) and unlike the other Mega Drive Dragon Slayer games, is not a product of the later Sega Falcom partnership.

In the main series, Sorcerian was followed by Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu. However, as with other main series entries, Sorcerian received a number of its own sequels on Japanese home computers, including the Dreamcast game Sorcerian: Shichisei Mahou no Shito.
