Mr. Nutz is a platform game developed by Ocean for a variety of video games platforms including the Sega Mega Drive in 1994. In the game you take control of Mr. Nutz, who must stop the evil yeti from freezing the world. The Mega Drive version was only released in Europe.

A sequel, titled Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad was released for the Amiga in the following months. It was planned for release on the Sega Mega Drive under the name of Mr. Nutz 2 but was ultimately scrapped despite reportedly being finished (and sent to various magazines for review). Uncompiled source code of the game was leaked in 2009 and compiled into a playable build in 2012.
