Link Dragon (Long) (Èæç) is an unlicensed Blockade clone for the Sega Mega Drive by the Taiwanese companies Songtly and Jumbo Team released in 1993. The game is divided into several levels; after collecting a certain amount of pieces (fire?) a door opens (which you must go to without dying). Dying starts you at the beginning of the stage.
