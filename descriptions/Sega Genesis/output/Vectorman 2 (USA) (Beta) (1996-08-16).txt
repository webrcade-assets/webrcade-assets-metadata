After saving Earth from Warhead in the previous game, Vectorman's sludge barge is targeted and destroyed by a missile. Vectorman escapes, parachuting down to the planet to battle with the Earth's multitudinous enemy; mutant insects. Now it is up to Vectorman to fight through the mutant bugs and find the most fearsome source infestation; the evil Black Widow Queen.
