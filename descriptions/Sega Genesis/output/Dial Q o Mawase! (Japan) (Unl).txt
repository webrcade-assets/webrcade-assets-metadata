Dial Q o Mawase! (Q), alternatively called Dial Q wo Mawase! and often pirated under the name Kyuukyoku Mahjong or Mahjong Lady, is a pornographic mahjong game for the Sega Mega Drive originating in Japan, but developed by unknown developers in some unknown year. The game is somewhat often pirated by other Japanese and Chinese pirates. It appears to be hacked out of Mahjong Cop Ryuu and steals the Cube/Noriyuki Iwadare sound driver.
