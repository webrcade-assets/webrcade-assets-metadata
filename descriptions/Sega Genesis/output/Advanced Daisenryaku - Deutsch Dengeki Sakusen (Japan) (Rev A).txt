Advanced Daisenryaku: Deutsch Dengeki Sakusen ( ), commonly referred to simply as Advanced Daisenryaku, is a 1991 strategy game developed jointly by Sega and SystemSoft and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in Japan. It is part of SystemSoft's Daisenryaku series of strategy games, and is one of the few retail Mega Drive games to have online play compatibility via Sega Meganet. It also started the Advanced Daisenryaku line, all of which have been published by Sega.

Sega and now-renamed SystemSoft Alpha rereleased the game in 2006 as part of Sega Ages 2500.

In 2002-2006, Nebelwurfer fan-translated the game to English as Advanced Military Commander along with a translated manual.
