FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims.

The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.
