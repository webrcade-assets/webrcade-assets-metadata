After choosing a mission, you can choose which shot type, gun type, and bomb to take with you on the helicopter, and you will then start the mission, A fires (hold for rapidfire). B drops a bomb. C activates the shield. After this routine, you have a short period in a larger ship just shooting at obstacles before landing, coming out of the plane, and moving around and shooting Commando-style.
