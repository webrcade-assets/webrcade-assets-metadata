Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.
