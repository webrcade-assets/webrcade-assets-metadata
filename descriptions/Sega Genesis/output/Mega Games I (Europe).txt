Mega Games I, released as Triple Score: 3 Games in 1 in the United States, is a compilation released for the Sega Mega Drive in Europe in 1992. It was the first of three similar compilations, and was only distributed with Sega Mega Drive II consoles. In the North American version, the World Cup Italia '90 tournament license was removed and replaced with World Championship Soccer.

The PAL version's box inlay is known in at least three different layouts. However, the cartridge and manuals are the same.
