Desert Strike depicts an antagonist named Kilbaba who seizes control of an unnamed, fictional Gulf state, installing himself as dictator. The United States sends a lone helicopter to destroy Kilbaba's army in a series of swift strikes.[1] The game's plot was felt by commentators to be a thinly disguised reference to the Gulf War and comparisons were drawn between Kilbaba and Saddam Hussein,[2] and between the game's unnamed desert setting and Iraq.
