Mickey must collect special items to keep up his strength and earn bonus points. Spell books, stars, crystal balls, potions and dinosaur eggs help him along the way. Enemies are dispatched by bouncing on them or casting small or large spells. If Mickey finds a wooden door he is led to a bonus area where he can collect many magical items.
