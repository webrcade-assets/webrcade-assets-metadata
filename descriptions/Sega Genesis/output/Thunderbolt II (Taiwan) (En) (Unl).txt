Thunderbolt II, which also refers to itself as Lei Dian Chuan Shuo II (雷電伝説II) or just Lei Dian II (雷電II) is an unlicensed vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1995. There is not thought to have been a Thunderbolt I - more likely it is borrowing its name from Raiden II, a 1993 arcade shooter by Seibu Kaihatsu that is a sequel to Raiden.
