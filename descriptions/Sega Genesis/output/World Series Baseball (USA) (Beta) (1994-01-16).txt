World Series Baseball is the first game in the long-running series. With all 28 teams included, it features the 6 division alignment (introduced shortly before its release), and has all 700 players of the league.

The game includes a play-by-play feature and the Home Run Derby. Players are able to play a 162-game season and keep full statistics for every player, thanks to a battery backup. The game also allows players to use the first-person perspective view from the batter's box.
