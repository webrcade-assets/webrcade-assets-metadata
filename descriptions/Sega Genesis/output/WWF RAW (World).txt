WWF Raw is a professional wrestling game featuring up to twelve superstars (ten in the GameGear, eight in the GameBoy version) from the World Wrestling Federation: Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Bam Bam Bigelow, 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, Doink, Lex Luger, Luna Vachon, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and Yokozuna.

In this game, player-controlled wrestlers attempt to pin the opponents to the mat by reducing their power meter until they can fight no more. There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and "illegal" acts such as hitting the opponent with a metal folding chair.

This game supports up to four simultaneous players, and has the following modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.
