The races took place in the U.S. states of Alaska, Hawaii, Tennessee, Arizona, and Vermont, on progressively longer two-lane roads. Races would be won by placing first, second, or third in each of the five tracks (as opposed to the first game, which would allow a victory by placing fourth as well). After all five tracks were won, the player would advance to the next level, where the track would be longer, the opponents faster, and much more money at stake for a victory or a loss.
