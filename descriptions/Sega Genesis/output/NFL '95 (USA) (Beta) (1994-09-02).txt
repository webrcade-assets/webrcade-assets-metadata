This video game is similar to the previous, NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, except in this version, there is no play by play commentary, the lineups of the football teams are updated to reflect the 1994 NFL season, and there are more plays for the player's football team to perform on offense and defense. Once again, Joe Montana appears on the title screen.
