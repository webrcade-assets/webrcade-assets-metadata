The Ultimate Team is a crossover of both Technos Japan's Double Dragon and Rare's own Battletoads game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in the production of the game outside of the Double Dragon license. The game features the characters from the Double Dragon series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts. Also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the Battletoads game. Some of the enemies are from the Battletoads and Double Dragon games, while others are original. The game's engine and design are directly based upon the Battletoads series.
