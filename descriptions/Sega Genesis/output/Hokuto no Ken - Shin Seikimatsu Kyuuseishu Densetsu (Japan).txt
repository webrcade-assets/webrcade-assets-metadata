Last Battle is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1989 by Sega. It was one of the six launch titles for the U.S. Sega Genesis release. The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken ( ?, "New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.
