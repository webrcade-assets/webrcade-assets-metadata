Rent A Hero (also incorrectly named Rent-A-Hero; Sega has never used hyphens in the game's romanized name) is a Japan-exclusive RPG developed by Sega AM2 for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 with a large emphasis on humour. It follows Taro Yamada (or "Rent A Hero"), a hero for hire that needs to complete various tasks to save the day.

The game borrows the engine used in Phantasy Star III, however instead of turn-based battles enemies are defeated through a versus-fighting system similar to Street Fighter II.

Though mostly unknown to the western world, Rent A Hero has been referenced several times across Sega products, including Fighters Megamix in which Taro is an unlockable character.

The game was remade for the Sega Dreamcast as Rent A Hero No.1. It has also been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan.
