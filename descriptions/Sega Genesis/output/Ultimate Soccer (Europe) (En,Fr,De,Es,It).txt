Ultimate Soccer ( ) is a football game developed by Rage Software (who at the time specialised in sports games) and published in 1993 by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. It was originally released a year earlier for the Commodore Amiga as "Striker", a name which the Super Nintendo port would retain, however, the Sega ports were renamed as Ultimate Soccer.

All three versions of the game were released in Europe, however Brazil did not see the Mega Drive version and Japan only saw the Game Gear port. No versions of Ultimate Soccer were released in North America.
