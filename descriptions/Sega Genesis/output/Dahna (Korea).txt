Players control the title character who, in a medieval fantasy setting, struggled against the powers of an evil sorceress raiding her village. The story is told through cut scenes and Dahna was helped along the way by various mythical beasts. The game has an extra level of violence to it as every enemy Dahna killed disappeared in a streak of blood and one end stage boss had to be defeated through constant dismemberment.
