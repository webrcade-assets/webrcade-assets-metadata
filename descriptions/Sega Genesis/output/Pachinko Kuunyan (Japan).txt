Pachinko Kuunyan is a 1992 pachinko game for the Sega Mega Drive by Soft Vision released exclusively in Japan. The game takes more of an adventure/RPG-type approach to presenting itself: you, as the main character, walk around in a top-view town containing both pachinko parlors (with machines you can go to and play) and other buildings.
