Double Dragon II: The Revenge (II ) is a action game developed and published by Technos in 1988 as a sequel to the original Double Dragon. Originally for the arcades, it was later ported to a variety of systems. PALSOFT ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive and released it exclusively in Japan in 1991. The port was fairly accurate in comparison to the NES version.

The Black Warriors shoot and kill Marian, whom was saved by Billy and Jimmy Lee from the same gang in the first Double Dragon, and now Billy and Jimmy fight to avenge her. Most of the enemies from the first game re-appear but with slightly redrawn sprites.
