This isn't a little skirmish in the air. This is a full-fledged, take-no-prisoners, hyper-drive war to the finish with three-dimensional screens and incredible sound effects. Simultaneous two-player action with horizontal and vertical scrolling means you need cunning, instinct, and flight skills to destroy the enemy...and survive!
