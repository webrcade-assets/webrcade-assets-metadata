Batman - The Video Game is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up which is based on the Tim Burton movie released one year prior. The game bears resemblance to earlier beat-'em-ups like Double Dragon in terms of graphics and to a certain extent gameplay. However, unlike many other beat-'em-ups of its time, Batman lacks two player co-operative play which in a way highlights the shallow gameplay and forgettable story. All of this does not equate to Batman being a 'bad' game, it simply a mediocre title.
