Action 52 features 52 different games in a single cartridge. Some of them are the same as those included with the identically entitled NES compilation, though most are unique to this release. The games are selected from a colored menu and are mostly side scrolling, platform or shooter action games. Each game is written in one color, yellow meaning "expert", purple "intermediate", green "beginner", blue "two players" and white "special".
