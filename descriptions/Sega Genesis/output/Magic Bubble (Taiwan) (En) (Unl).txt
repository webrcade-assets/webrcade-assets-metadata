Magic Bubble is an unlicensed 1993 puzzle game developed by C&E for the Sega Mega Drive. It was the only game produced by C&E (a Taiwanese company) where the packaging, instructions and in-game text is all in English. The game involves matching like-coloured bubbles which float to the top of the screen.

In the 2000s, publishing rights to the game were purchased by Super Fighter Team, who also published a translation of another of C&E's games, Beggar Prince.
