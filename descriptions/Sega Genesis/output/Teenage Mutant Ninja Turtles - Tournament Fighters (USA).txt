The game features eight fighters: the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, Ray Fillet (from the comics) and the original character Sisphyus.

The gameplay is similar to other games in this genre: each character has standard attacks (normal and strong) as well as special attacks which require button combinations to perform. The goal is to deplete the other fighter's life energy completely. However, a losing opponent has one last straw: a very powerful attack which is only unlocked shortly before death. The amount of rounds can be set between one and seven.
