Buster Bunny's mission in this game is to trace down and defeat Montana Max, who has stolen and hidden some treasure as well as rescue Babs Bunny. Buster must go through several levels, including a volcano, an undersea adventure, a pirate ship, and a forest, among many other levels. However, many of his foes are out to stop him, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster's friends, including Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Hamton J Pig. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet used to control Buster's friends will fall off and explode, leaving them slightly confused about what has happened to them, or simply to fall down in a comical fashion, as in the case of Calamity Coyote.

To complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to jump through a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show's rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.
