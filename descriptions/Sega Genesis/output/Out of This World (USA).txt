There it is - the particle accelerator you've invented. You are so intent on testing it, you don't even notice the crackling outside of a not-so-distant electrical storm. Before you can say snap, crackle, pop, a lightning bolt slams through you and the accelerator with deadly accuracy. When you finally come to, you have no idea where you are. Are you being watched? Is this place home? In order to survive, you'll need to dodge, outwit and overcome deadly alien monsters and blood-sucking leeches who think you're a delicacy. Now that shouldn't be too hard for a whiz kid like you, right? Out of this World bridges the gap between cinema and action/adventure games with a completely new style of fluid, cinematic storytelling.
