Striker is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear football game. It was only released in Europe.
Confusingly it is the third game by Rage Software to use the Striker moniker - the original Striker was released for the Amiga in 1992 (later ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1994) and formed the basis for all Striker games to come. A second Striker was released for the Super Nintendo in 1994, being known as World Soccer '94: Road to Glory in North America, World Soccer in Japan and Eric Cantona Football Challenge in France. This third Striker was made exclusive to Sega systems as a spiritual sequel to Ultimate Soccer.
