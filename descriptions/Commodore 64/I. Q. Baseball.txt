I. Q. Baseball is an animated baseball trivia game for 1 - 2 players. Played on an animated baseball field, the player can compete against the computer or another human. Every time a pitch is thrown, the player is asked a multiple choice question related to baseball. If the player is batting, and answers an answer correctly, there is a chance they'll successfully score a hit, or potentially a run. If they are wrong, they'll strike out. There is a small chance of getting out even with a correct answer. If competing against the computer, the player must answer questions while pitching, to try to strike their computer opponent out. Each game involves 9 innings, with 3 outs per inning.
