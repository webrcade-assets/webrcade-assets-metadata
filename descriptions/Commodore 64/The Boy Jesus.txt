The Boy Jesus is the third game in Series 1 of the Baker Street Kids franchise, with stories written by father/son duo V. Gilbert Beers and Ronald Beers. It consists of 14 Bible stories, depicting the nativity of St. John the Baptist, and the Nativity of the Lord Jesus, and his infancy and childhood. Bible passages: The Gospel According to Matthew, Chapter 2; and the Gospel According to Luke, Chapters 1-2. After selecting one of fourteen stories, you are given a choice of one of three difficulty levels: Tough, Very Tough, or Super Tough. For each story selection, you get to read the story (some of them riddled with typos and some inaccuracies in Bible translation), and then answer several questions about it, consisting of choosing one of three options. Frequently the questions will be true or false questions, but because there are three options, one option will be "who knows?", "doesn't say", "maybe", "don't know", etc. -- which is guaranteed to be wrong. Once you get at least most of the answers right, you are treated to a little light animation.
