Kairos has kidnapped children and trapped them in mirrors inside his castle. The player takes the role of Mac in his quest so save them. The main portion of the game is spend with walking through the castle and fighting Kairo's henchmen - either with bare hands or with weapons which can be collected on the way. However, the way is not completely linear: there are different routes to take. A boss room waits at the end of each level (overall five). There are also a multitude of extras to collect which have effects like destroying all enemies on the screen or warping. Freeing enough children by punching out mirrors gives a short time of invulnerability.
