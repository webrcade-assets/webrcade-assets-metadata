A Week That Changed the World is the second game in Series 2 of the Baker Street Kids franchise, with stories written by father/son duo V. Gilbert Beers and Ronald Beers. It consists of 14 Bible stories, starting with Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem, going through Holy Week to the Passion of the Lord, and ending with the death of Judas Iscariot. Bible passages: The Gospel According to Matthew, Chapters 21-22 and Chapters 26 and 27, verses 1-10; The Gospel According to Mark, Chapters 11-12 and Chapter 14; The Gospel According to Luke, 19:28--21:4, and Chapter 22; and the Gospel According to John, Chapter 12, verses 1-16, and Chapter 18, verses 1-27. After selecting one of fourteen stories, you are given a choice of one of three difficulty levels: Tough, Very Tough, or Super Tough. For each story selection, you get to read the story (some of them riddled with typos and some inaccuracies in Bible translation), and then answer several questions about it, consisting of choosing one of three options. Frequently the questions will be true or false questions, but because there are three options, one option will be "who knows?", "doesn't say", "maybe", "don't know", etc. -- which is guaranteed to be wrong. Once you get at least most of the answers right, you are treated to a little light animation.
