Number Farm is a series of educational mini-games to teach numbers and counting. It contains six animal-themed mini-games: Animal Quackers: listen to the animal, and tell how many times the barked, quaked, mooed, or made any other sound. Crop Count: the player counts the number of crops on the screen. They must do this as many times as possible before the sun sets. Hen House: try to guess how many hens have laid eggs. The player is told if the answer is higher or lower. Horseshoes: throw the number of horseshoes displayed on the screen. Number Farm: press a number, and the corresponding number of animals appear. Old McDonald: follow along with the song, and type the number of animals that appear.
