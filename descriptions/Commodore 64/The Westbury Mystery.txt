Five rings stolen from your guardian have been taken and held in Westbury House but while you are searching the house looking for them you are kidnapped and held in the cellar. This isn't the best place to be held captive as there are rumours of strange things going on with a cult and frightening rituals being carried out. With experiments being carried out on people, you need to escape as soon as possible with the five rings before you become the next victim. The Westbury Mystery is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
