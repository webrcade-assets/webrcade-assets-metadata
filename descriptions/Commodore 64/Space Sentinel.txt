Space Sentinel is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. A small space ship continuously orbits the Earth, able to fire in 8 separate directions, but unable to change its course. Alien ships approach from multiple directions, and fire upon the Earth. As the Earth is hit, pieces of the Northern Hemisphere begin to disappear into the sea. The player must defend the Earth from alien assault for as long as possible.
