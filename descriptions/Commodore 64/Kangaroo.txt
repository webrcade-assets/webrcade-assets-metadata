Kangaroo is an adaptation of an early 80's game released on Atari and Arcade platforms. The story and the gameplay remain unchanged. By guiding the kangaroo mother, the player must reach the top of the board to rescue an imprisoned kangaroo child. Numerous monkeys will try to interrupt the mission by throwing or dropping apples and knocking the kangaroo off the platforms. The kangaroo mother has the boxing gloves, which allow knocking out the monkeys with a single punch for a short period of time.
