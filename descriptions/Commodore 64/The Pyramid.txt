Somewhere in this vast desert is the Lost Tomb of Rak-Tuman and all his treasure. Many men have set out to become rich but none have returned with few actually reaching the pyramid itself. You are one such treasure hunter, and with a map you set off towards The Pyramid but be careful as it's easy to get lost in the desert. If you make it there will be puzzles, traps and creatures waiting for you. The Pyramid is a text adventure where text describes each location and you type commands with the keyboard to control your hero and interact with each location.
