Metamorphosis is a single screen game spread over four screens as you enter the fortress belonging to 'The Creator' and your quest is to destroy him as well as any robots that inhabit his home. The first screen has you attempting to get to an exit at the top of the screen while robots move around the screen leaving a trail of walls that can't be passed. If you touch a robot then you lose one of five lives and have to attempt to escape again. The second screen is full of eggs containing robots guarded by tanks and you have to destroy all the tanks while avoiding getting shot or hitting the tanks themselves. Once all tanks are destroyed then the eggs will hatch and you need to destroy all the robots. Later screens have you facing more robots, The Creator himself as well as his power source which needs destroying to complete your quest.
