Q-Bopper is a 1-player Q*bert clone for the TRS-80 CoCo. The player tries to change the color of all the squares in a puzzle by jumping between positions. The player can lose a life by falling off the squares, or running into a monster that moves about the puzzle. A different cube-shaped enemy will try to change squares back to their original color, and can be defeated by occupying the same space as the enemy. On each higher level, it takes more turns to change the squares to their final color.
