Ekim the Giant Ant lives on a hut, on one of a group of islands favoured by Pirates. They have trained him to move their treasure for them, and the player controls Ekim in this action game. Treasure will randomly appear on the islands, and Ekim must reach it and return it to his hut. A treasure chest contains existing treasure to grab, but opens and closes at random - Ekim must not be trapped inside it when it closes. Some islands are linked by bridges and logs, but to reach others you must cross on either turtles or crocodiles, who are moving around the screen. When riding a turtle you must keep moving in the same direction as it, to account for its slipperiness, while the appearance of a croc causes the turtles to dive underwater, causing Ekim to drown and lose one of five lives). Energy is limited, but can be topped up by eating.
