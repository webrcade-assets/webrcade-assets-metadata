Our grandfather was an adventurer who found a big treasure in a pyramid. Unfortunately he was the only survivor of the expedition and no one took his discovery seriously. Now we step in his shoes, visit the South American jungle and try to get the treasure. Schatzj√§ger is a typical text adventure, although in German language: the player navigates the environment, enters commands into the parser and solves puzzles. Each scene is accompanied with graphics and it is possible to die.
