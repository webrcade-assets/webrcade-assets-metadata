Aegean Voyage is a 1 - 2 player educational adventure game for multiple systems. The player starts at the port city of Athens, and must sail to the various islands of the Aegean in search of treasures. At each island the player visits, they receive a clue as to whether the island contains treasure or a monster. The player must use deductive reasoning to determine what each island contains. If the player sails their ship into land, or explores an island with a monster, their ship is destroyed. Sailing is made more difficult by the occasional storm or Zeus throwing lightning bolts. The player starts with 3 ships, and if all are lost, it's game over. As the player gains treasure, they can buy an extra ship for 400 drachmae.
