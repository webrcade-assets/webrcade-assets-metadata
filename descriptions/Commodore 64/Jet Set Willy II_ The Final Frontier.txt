This platform game is the sequel of Jet Set Willy and basically just an extension of the previous game, adding 40 rooms to the existing 64 rooms of its predecessor. The gameplay otherwise remains almost identical, apart from a few minor changes. Upon death, Willy respawns in a specific safe spot rather than at a room's entrance, helping prevent some "unavoidable infinite death" scenarios. Jump physics were also modified a bit from the original game. Much like Jet Set Willy the game features copy protection: when the game is loaded, the user is given a reference to the included sheet and has to enter the four colours shown there.
