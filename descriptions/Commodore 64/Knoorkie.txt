Knoorkie is a platform game, where the player - as a pig named Knoorkie - must find a solution to defeat a dragon, harassing local residents. The task requires solving many puzzles, finding useful objects, performing tasks ordered by the inhabitants. The action takes place in the castle and its surroundings, such as forest, coal mine, abandoned village, undergrounds. Defeating the dragon requires the acquisition of 20 horseshoes scattered throughout the area (depriving him of immortality) and a silver sword to lop off his head.
