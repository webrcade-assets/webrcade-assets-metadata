Chomp! is a single-player game where the player controls a goldfish, trying to grow bigger by eating small sea creatures and eventually other fish. The fish begins in a small goldfish bowl and progresses from aquarium to aquarium, with the goal of reaching the river outside. As the game progresses, the fish must avoid dangers such as piranhas, fishnets, and cats' paws.
