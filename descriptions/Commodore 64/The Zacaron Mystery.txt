The Zacaron Mystery is a traditional text adventure made using the Quill adventure generation software from Gilsoft. You tell the game what you want to do via a textual interface and the parser is based on a verb / noun input. The year is 3065 and Earth's fuel reserves will only last a few more months. The only solution is to find two Zacaron crystals on the distant planets of Prutor and Myra. You play the role of a skilled interstellar pilot that is sent to retrieve the crystals.
