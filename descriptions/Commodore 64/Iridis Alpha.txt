There is war on the planet Iridis Alpha between the Humans and the defenses on the planet left there by the Iridians. The Iridians have left the planet, leaving it in stasis while they are off looking for peace and having evolved beyond the need for physical bodies. Naturally the Iridians wanted to protect their precious planet from being robbed and they installed some heavy defenses. The defenses are based on a multiphase reality, allowing it to exist in two realities at the same time. Furthermore there are 5 different realities, each in two orientations. These weapons were very interesting to the Humans in their fight against the Zzyaxians, on whose planet Zzyax-Prime the existence of Iridian-Prime was discovered in the Iridian Base there. In order to deal with this confusing planet, the Humans built a craft containing a specially adapted brain which called itself Gilbie. Gilbie has to fight the Iridian defenses by killing the Iridian ships to absorb their energy (but not too much or Gilbie will explode). This energy can then be exchanged with the planet's core. Once the core has enough energy Gilbie celebrates by playing their favourite sport Point to Point Racing. It is vital that Gilbie switches orientations once Entropy has eroded one reality's energy away. Iridis Alpha is a Horizontal shoot-em-up viewed from the side. You control Gilbie with a joystick and to switch between planet orientations you have to shoot an Iridian ship leaving behind a ring. You enter the ring without pressing the fire button to switch. The Point to Point Racing is a where you race up a vertical top-down scrolling course. When you're tired or bored of the main games then you can pause the game and play a relaxing game called Made in France which is version of an older Jeff Minter game called Deflex.
