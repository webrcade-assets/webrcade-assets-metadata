Ultrex Quadro Maze is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Each level contains 4 small mazes displayed in the corners of the screen. The player moves through each maze, trying to gather all the pellets while avoiding a monster. After completing a maze, the player jumps to the next one. Maze design is randomized between each level, and there is an animated sequence accompanying each jump. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
