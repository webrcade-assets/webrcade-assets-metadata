Word Master is a 1-player educational game for multiple systems. A word appears in the center of the screen, and 8 surrounding words slowly fire towards the player. The player must rotate a turret to shoot the antonym of the word that appears in the middle of the screen. If the player shoots the correct block, a new word appears in the middle of the screen. The player must shoot all 8 words before the approaching gunfire reaches the center of the game field.
