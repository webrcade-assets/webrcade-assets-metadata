TSI Cycles is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Each player controls a blue or red light cycle. As the vehicles drive, they leave behind a string of light. If either player runs into the trail left by a light cycle, the opponent gains a point. Game options include 1 - 2 players and solid or no border. The game tracks score over multiple rounds.
