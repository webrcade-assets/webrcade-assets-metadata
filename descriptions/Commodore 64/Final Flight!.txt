Final Flight! is a 1-player airplane simulation for multiple systems. The player attempts to land a large airliner safely on a runway. Played from a 1st person perspective, the player's instrument panel shows an altimeter, distance to runway, vertical and horizontal velocity, power, and remaining fuel. The player can apply the breaks or move the flaps up or down. The player can choose from clear or cloudy weather conditions, and from 4 levels of difficulty.
