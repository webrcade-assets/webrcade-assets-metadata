In Laser Strike, you commandeer a space fighter that is trying to navigate through an asteroid field and ice caverns. Approaching you are asteroids that must be avoided. Space debris that float by are usually harmless until they turn orange. Occasionally, a missile will rise up from the ground and make its way toward you, and this too must be avoided. The distance to the next section is indicated by the blue bar next to the number of lives; as you progress through each section, the bar will get shorter. You start with two lives and lose one of them if you hit an asteroid, lethal space debris, and missile. An extra life is awarded by shooting the control center near the ice cavern. If you complete both sections, you start again from the first, but the difficulty will be ramped up.
