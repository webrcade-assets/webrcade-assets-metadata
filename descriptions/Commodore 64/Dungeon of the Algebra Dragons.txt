Dungeon of the Algebra Dragons is an educational game for the Commodore 64. You have been imprisoned within a multi-layered dungeon, and must collect keys and escape to the surface. Played from a 3rd person perspective game, the player must move from room to room searching for the keys while attempting to avoid spiders, dragons, and ghosts. In each room, you are presented with three numbered doors and you have the option of jumping or moving through a door. Players are told if there are and what type of dangers are nearby. Ghosts will move the player to another part of the tomb, and dragons ask the player an algebra question. Dragons award the player with gold if questions are answered correctly, and take it away if incorrect. The player can jump on spiders, or be bitten by them. Some rooms have pits, which drop the player to lower levels. There are 4 levels of question difficulty.
