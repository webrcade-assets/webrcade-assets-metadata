ROX begins with a Lunar Lander sequence, where the player is to land the lunar module on the planet's surface by applying vertical thrusters. Once there the objective is to protect your base from falling meteors or "ROX" from space. Your module has rockets that shoot in a straight line, in three different directions to defend itself. You also have three "panics" which will destroy any incoming meteors and a mothership will appear every few levels that needs to be disposed of. If a meteor hits your base or causes enough damage to the planet's surface to cause an earthquake, the game is lost.
