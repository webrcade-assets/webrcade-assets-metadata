Bumblebee is a 1-player educational game for the Commodore 64. You control Bart the Bumblebee, by giving him instructions to travel from his beehive, and then go from flower to flower and return to his bumblebee. The player inputs movement commands for the bumblebee, while trying to avoid dangers including Olga the Spider and Phineas the Frog. Commands include direction, waiting periods, and loops. The bumblebee has a limited time to complete the level, and there are 10 increasingly difficult puzzle levels.
