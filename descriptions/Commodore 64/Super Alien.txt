Super Alien is a single-screen action game. The player moves through the maze and can place traps on the floor. When a monster walks into it, it becomes trapped and the player can kill it by filling in the hole. Each defeated monster rewards points while touching them results in a life loss. The maze is shown from the usual top-down perspective, but the characters have a side-view.
