Bismark is a 1-player strategy game for multiple systems. The player controls the British North Atlantic squadrons in the hunt for the Bismark.  The player has 13 turns, each encompassing 6 hours, to find and destroy the battleship before British forces have to return home to refuel. Each turn, the player moves their 12 naval groups, and all forces can move 2 areas per turn except Vian's destroyers which can move up to 3 per turn.  When all ships have moved, the player is informed if any vessels can see the Bismark.  During poor weather the Bismark is spotted if a ship is in the same position, and in fair or good weather the Bismark can be spotted from 1 space away.  The player further has 2 aircraft carriers, the Ark Royal and the Victorious, which can carry out airstrikes if within 4 spaces of the carrier and spotted. British ships will attack the Bismark if within range.  The Bismark always attacks first, and is the strongest vessel on the field, so multiple British ships must be brought to bear against the German vessel to sink it.  During battle, ships will fire continuously, and the player can break off combat if needed.  Combat occurs until one ship is sunk or one breaks away.
