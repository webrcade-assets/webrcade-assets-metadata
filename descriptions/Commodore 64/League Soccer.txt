League Soccer is a soccer league simulation game for the VIC-20. The player creates a soccer league consisting of 2 - 22 teams, each with their own name and merit level from 1 - 9. The player can then have teams play in league and non-league games, and track their score over multiple games. Games are automatically simulated with the higher merit team having an increased probability of victory. The league can also have cup draws and play for the cup final. Games can be saved in progress, and there are short and long game options.
