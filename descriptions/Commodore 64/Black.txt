Black is a 2-player board game for the Commodore 64. Played on a 4 x 4 - 8 x 8 board, players take turns placing movement pieces on the board. This can make a marker dropped from the top left corner of the screen move straight, bend left, or bend right. Players take turns dropping a piece at the ending location of the marker. If the player allows the marker to roll off the board or land in the bottom right square, they lose.
