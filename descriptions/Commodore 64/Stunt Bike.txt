In this single screen arcade game you have to use your Stunt Bike to navigate across the nine hazardous obstacle courses, from one end of the screen to the other. You control your bike by accelerating to jump between platforms and collect flags along the way. You jump by doing a wheely and hit a ramp. A fuel meter acts as a timer for the level. Once all flags are collected a portcullis opens and the level can be completed.
