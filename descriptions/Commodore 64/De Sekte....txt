According to a secret and confidential file, the mysterious cult leader Leon H. Rabburd (based on L. Ron Hubbard) suddenly disappeared from Achnasheen on November 18, 1962. He is/was the founder of a supposedly no longer existing religious sect which was reportedly involved in the worship of the same Leon H. Rabburd! But not only has he disappeared, his considerable fortune from his bank and the contents of his personal safe are gone as well. Now you have travelled to the place where he expressed his "faith", to search for his fortune. An abandoned church in Achnasheen, somewhere on the Scottish Highlands. De Sekte... is a graphic text adventure in Dutch where you have to use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. It is possible to shorten sentences such as 'ga deur' (go door) of 'open raam' (open window), but you can also give one-letter commands such as 'n(oord)', 'z(uid)', 'o(ost)', 'w(est)' for wind directions, and 'h(oog)' and 'l(aag)' for general directions. When you type 'k(ijk)' (look at) you get a description of your location. However, if you want to know what the visible items are in your location you need to type 'v(oorwerpen)' (items). 'r(ichting)' (direction) will give you information about possible exits. The MSX version of this game has no save/load option, some of the commands do not work such as 'drj' (tells you about some other games that were made by Radarsoft), 'a(lle voorradige informatie)', 'g' (same as 'a' and it will show you the full description of the location, plus items and exits), 'opnieuw' (restart game) and the solution differs from the C64 version.
