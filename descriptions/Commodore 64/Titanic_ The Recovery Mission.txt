You're the president of the Titanic Salvage Company and it's your job to recover any artifacts you can find from the wreck of the H.M.S. Titanic and ultimately raise the ship to the surface. The game combines both above and below water aspects.  Above the water, you must manage the company, press conferences and finances.  Below the water, you explore the Titanic and her many secrets by navigating T.S.1 (your underwater robot) through a maze-like environment while trying to find a way to raise the ship to the surface. You must find eight flotation bags in order to raise the vessel. Along the way, you'll find several hidden items that combine to create yet another item, many of which are required to open locked doors, safes and other hidden compartments.
