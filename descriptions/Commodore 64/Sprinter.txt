Sprinter is a Dutch train simulator for multiple systems. In this program, as a train driver of a Sprinter, you must control the signals that appear on the right of the screen as well as possible. And, among other things, you must ensure that your train stops exactly at the stations. The goal is to cover as many kilometers as possible before the A.T.B. (Automatische Trein Be√Ønvloeding or Automatic Train Control) intervenes. The A.T.B. ensures that if an incorrect action is taken, for example by not reducing speed at a yellow signal, the train automatically comes to a stop. If you forget to close the doors on departure, the warning "Levensgevaarlijk (Extremely dangerous)" will appear on the screen.
