Confict is a text-based board game for two players, in which you have to manage all the resources with making war. You have the option of trading your resources in, plunder, or mine your cash. The game board is divided into a 26x20 grid, and more than half of it is sea, and the rest of it is split into two territories. You can invade the enemy, or try to occupy as much territory as you can after an agreed number of moves. Revenue can be raised through share dealings, through forays to capture neutral shipping, and through prospecting of oil. The stock market goes up when you buy shares and down when you sell them. Oil can be found randomly on squares in each territory. Ships are blown about depending on weather.
