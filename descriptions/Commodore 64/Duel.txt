Duel is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. You are lost on an icy planet astride a mutant bird. The bird can run along flat terrain, but can also fly up into the air. Your opponents carry energy nodules. To defeat them, and retrieve the energy nodules, the player must strike the enemy from above or behind. If an energy nodule is not collected and falls into the deadly water at the bottom of the screen, then the evil warlords will use their energy to melt their icy prison at the center of the screen. If the player clears all enemies on the screen, they proceed to the next stage. The player starts with 5 lives, and there is a tournament mode where 2 players can compete.
