Combination is a puzzle game where the player's goal is to clear all the pieces from the playing field. This is achieved by pushing identical pieces together using a blinking cursor controlled by a joystick. Gravity affects the pieces, causing them to fall down when there is a free space below. Groups of at least two identical pieces adjacent horizontally or vertically are removed from the board. The player can restart a level up to three times during the game, and there is a time limit to complete each level.
