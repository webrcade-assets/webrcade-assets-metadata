Codeword Arguseye in Secret Mission is a text adventure with graphics for the Commodore 64. Earth has developed over the past 500 years. All over the universe there are star colonies. Extraterrestrial life couldn't be found, and soon the stories of UFOs and green Martians are forgotten. But on the 25th of May, 2550, extraterrestrial creatures stole top secret papers from moon station Lunar IV. There aliens' energy trail has been tracked to unexplored planet C-43 in the star cluster B-39. Special agent 12-34-P has been dressed as one of the aliens and taught their behaviors. They have been brought by an automated battle cruiser to planet C-43, and must recover the papers.

From the streets of C-43, they must find and invade the government headquarters of the alien power, recover the papers, and return safely to their battle cruiser.
