Master Head is a variant of Soko-Ban. On each level, the player, as a warehouse keeper, must push around crates to get them onto the right spots. Once all crates are moved onto a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time and cannot be pulled. A single wrong move can be undone with the P key. If the player gets stuck, it is possible to restart the level, but it causes the player to lose a life.
