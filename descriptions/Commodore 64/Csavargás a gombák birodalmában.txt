Csavargás a gombák birodalmában (translated as Stroll In The Realm Of Mushrooms) is a Hungarian educational game about the different mushroom types you can find in the forest. View is in first person perspective. You collect the mushrooms to sell them on the market. Switching from movement mode to cursor mode is by pressing fire, switching back is by clicking on the icon with the little guy. When you find a mushroom in the forest, you click on it to see the a drawing of it in the upper right corner. For further hints, clicking on the drawing reveals a description. Then you either ignore the mushroom, or click on the basket icon to pick it up. If you choose to get it, the program reveals the kind of the mushroom, and different icons appear on the bottom of the screen indicating how good or harmful is the content of your basket. At certain intervals you meet with people lurking in the forest with good or bad intentions, and you can choose how to deal with them. There is a money sum indicator and a health counter in the bottom right corner of the screen. Bumping into trees also depletes your health. When a house icon appears on the right side icon bar, you have reached a market where you can sell your mushrooms.
