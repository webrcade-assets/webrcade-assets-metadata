Pir8! was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 2k size category. It is a platform game, where you control a man who must get out of the dark cellar of a building. You can walk left and right with the joystick, and jump by pressing fire. When close to a wall, the protagonist can climb it and get to a higher platform if you press "up". Falling too far will kill you.
