Freddy's Puzzling Adventure is a series of English and math logic games for one or two players. It contains two types of games. Stage selection occurs by swimming Freddy the turtle to different puzzle locations, labelled by signs on islands. In number games, the player must move numbers around a maze to put them in the correct order. The player can only move one number at a time, and can only move that number to a currently blank location. The game keeps track of how many turns it takes to complete the task. There are several different difficulty levels. In word games, the player must move letters on a sliding block puzzle. Puzzles are 2x3, 3x3, or 4x4 based upon difficulty level. The goal is to position all letters on the board so that every letter is used to make a word. The player can make custom word puzzles.
