Traffic Jam is a 2-player board game for the Commodore 64. Four cars are placed on a 5 x 5 triangular board. There are a total of 15 cities, with a 1-way route between each city. Players move cars between cities, and there is always 1 city that has no exit route. The game ends when all cars are stuck in this city, and the player who made the last move is the loser. If each player repeats the same move 10 times in row, the game is declared a draw.
