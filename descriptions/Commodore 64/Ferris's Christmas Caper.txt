Ferris has been a naughty boy. On Christmas Eve, he managed to find all of the family's presents and destroyed them all. As punishment, he has been kicked out of  his home and forced to get twenty-five Christmas presents scattered around C-Zone. If Ferris thinks this is easy, he is wrong. You see, the presents are hard to find, and Ferris only has a limited amount of time to find them before Christmas begins. If he fails to get all of them before the time is up, Ferris is going to be in a lot of trouble.
