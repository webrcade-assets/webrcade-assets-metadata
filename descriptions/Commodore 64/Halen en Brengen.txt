Halen en Brengen is a Dutch educational game designed to teach parsing sentences that appear on the screen one by one. They must be analyzed into predicate, subject, direct object, indirect object and adverbial clause. Using the helicopter, the sentences can be retrieved word by word. For this purpose use the keys 5, 6, 7 and 8 (C64: the function keys F1 "up", F3 "left", F5 "right" and F7 "down"). You can retrieve a word by placing the retrieval cable above the word and pressing the BREAK SPACE key (C64: the space bar). To place the word after the relevant phrase indication, also press the BREAK SPACE key (C64: again the space bar), leaving a space. The sentence file consists of three parts of 65 sentences each, from which you can choose: 1. Sentences with two clauses, 2. Sentences with three clauses or 3. Sentences with four or five clauses. The puzzle game starts when the sentence has been properly parsed. Here you see an example house at the bottom left of the screen with the contours of the house to be built by you next to it. The blocks, on the right, must be placed in these contours using the helicopter, which can be moved with keys 5, 6, 7 and 8 (C64: the function keys F1, F3, F5 and F7). Connect the blocks with the BREAK SPACE key (C64: the space bar). By pressing the R key you can rotate the blocks. Disconnect when properly placed using the BREAK SPACE key (C64: again the space bar). The self-created sentence file must consist of a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 65 sentences. The sentences to be entered can consist of 2 lines, each of up to 30 characters, including spaces and punctuation marks. Leave a space before the punctuation mark. Each sentence must not exceed 21 characters, including spaces. After typing the line, enter the following code for each word separately: 0 - for the punctuation mark, 1 - for the predicate, 2 - for the subject, 3 - for the direct object, 4 - for the indirect object, 5 - for the adverbial.
