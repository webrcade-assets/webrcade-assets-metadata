The planet Earth is on the verge of being invaded by a group of aliens whose objective is the conquest of other planets. They are approaching Earth in a fleet of twenty cylinders containing cities, fields, factories, power stations, military bases, and shoe shops. As the aliens launch their attack on Earth, a pilot, controlled by the player, has been sent to destroy each cylinder one by one within a certain amount of time. Once the pilot has done enough damage to the cylinder, the pilot then proceeds to the escape portal. This escape portal has a security system which consists of five rows of colored squares that scrolls from right to left. For a successful hack, the player must line up two arrows that point to a square, and fire at the square whose color matches the border of the screen. If the player fails the hack, then they have to destroy the cylinder again. If successful, the player proceeds to the next cylinder where theirtask becomes more difficult.
