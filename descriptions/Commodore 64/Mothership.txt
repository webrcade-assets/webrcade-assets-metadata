Mothership is a shoot 'em up where the player has to defend his home planet from an enemy attack. The attack consists of a large mothership and numerous speedy drone fighters (who according to the instructions move around like crazed lemmings). The player controls his space ship down something called the Zarway space corridor while trying to dodge and shoot down as many enemies as he can. The player starts out at the bottom of the screen but can move in all directions. When moving upwards the speed of the game increases but so does the point rewards from shot down enemies. The game is two parted. First the player has to destroy ten droids in a row without being shot. Once that has been accomplished the player gets the chance to take down the mothership. To do so he has to hit it three times. There are three difficulty levels. At level 1 the droids try to crash into the player but they doesn't shoot. At level 2 they start shooting back at the player but they won't try crashing into him. At level 3 they will do both. At the same time the player has to avoid crashing into the side of the space corridor or he will die. The game play be played by one or two player, although not at the same time.
