Shape Shop is a 1 - 2 player educational game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a construction robot, that can move in all directions, pick up items, and press buttons. Items come down the conveyor belt, but they are missing a shape. The player must create the correct shape, make it the correct color, and place it on the unfinished object, to complete the finished model. There are 3 levels of difficulty, which control the missing shapes and speed. If the player misses 3 pictures, it's game over.
