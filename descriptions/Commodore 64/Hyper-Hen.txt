Hyper-Hen is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. The player controls a hen that moves about a series of paths trying to collect all the eggs and spaces on the field. When the player picks up an egg, an additional chicken hawk begins to descend from the top of the screen, which costs a life if it catches the hen. There are 6 coyotes trapped in cages, and 1 of the coyotes is randomized to escape and begin to move about the maze after the player clears the field around them. A Zompbie also moves randomly about the field to inflict death upon the hen. If the player finds themselves trapped, they can hyper jump up to 3 times to a different location on the field. There are 5 levels of game difficulty, and the player starts with 3 lives.
