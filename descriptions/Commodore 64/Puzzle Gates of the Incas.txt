Puzzle Gates of the Incas is a 1-player educational puzzle game for multiple systems. The Inca gods don't take kindly to mortals invading their realm.  As an intrepid archaeologist and treasure hunter, the player must try to navigate these puzzle to reach deeper inside the temples.  The player encounters a 3 x 3 grid with different combinations of icons, colors, and numbers.  The player must move their pointer to select the tile that is out of place.  At higher levels only a small area of the puzzle is illuminated at a time.  The player has limited time to solve each puzzle.  If the correct tile is pressed, the gate opens up to allow passage.  If the wrong square is selected, time rapidly speeds up, and if the puzzle isn't solved in time the game is over.
