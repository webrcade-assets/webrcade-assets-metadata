Manganoid is an Arkanoid variant for up to two players. Regardless of the number of players there are two palettes available - one the top and left side. Removing cubes from the board reveals a manga style picture. All other Arkanoid rules apply, especially bonuses facilitating (two balls) or hindering (smaller pads) the task.
