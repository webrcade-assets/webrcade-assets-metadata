Railroad is a puzzle and arcade game for the C64. The aim of the game is to prevent moving trains from colliding or derailing due to the rails being interrupted in some places on a railway network. This is by changing the rails. To move the rails you use a cursor step by step over the field. This will redirect rails at intersections in the directions of movement. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can turn the trains. This can only be done three times. At the beginning only one train runs on the rails, but after awhile a second train will come into motion. The speed increases as you progress in the game.
