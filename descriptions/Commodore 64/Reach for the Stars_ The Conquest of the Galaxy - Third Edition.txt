The third and final edition of Reach for the Stars: The Conquest of the Galaxy is a near total rewrite of the game, replacing the entire structure and flow of the original with a menu-based interface similar to SSG's other games available in 1988, and for the first time is available on 16-bit platforms as well as the Apple II and Commodore 64 that Roger Keating and Ian Trout originally wrote it for. In addition to the revamped interface and tweaks to the basic game, RFTS 3.0 offers a new advanced scenario, with significant changes and additions, including ground armies, new mechanics on governing conquered planets, new technology trees for navigation and industrial capacity, and progressive social maintenance costs.
