All Huxley Pig wants to do is go to bed and daydream about being a pilot, chef and sailor. Problem is that he has left the front door open which has let in creepy crawlies and various characters who have hidden his toys and pilot, chef and sailor outfits. All items must be collected before Huxley can go to bed and have his special daydreams. Huxley Pig is a side view item collect game, based on a British stop-motion television series of the same name. One room is seen at a time and the screen flicks when the player enters a new room. Displayed on the screen is the main playing area, a sandwich which is the energy meter, the score and a speech bubble which shows the next item to collect. Various items must be collected so Huxley can walk past the characters who are blocking parts of the house to collect items which will help him complete his mission. Touching the creepy crawlies and characters makes energy slowly disappear, but it can be refilled by getting the bread in the kitchen. Once the game is completed, three mini-games are available: "Huxley's Airways", "Pizza! Pizza!" and "Speedboat".
