Number Tumblers is an educational game teaching mathematics. The game is played on a network of tumblers, cubes with either numbers or signs on them, where the player controls a creature called Wumblechum who has to jump between the tumblers to reach target numbers. After jumping on a + sign each number cube that gets jumped on is added and in the same way numbers are subtracted after jumping on a - sign. There are also multiplication and division signs. There are five target numbers and once one has been reached the counter is reset and the player starts working towards another one. The game can be played by one or two players. In the single player mode it's possible to play alone in a solitaire mode or against an AI opponent in a computer challenge. The two player mode can be played either simultaneously or by alternating.
