Bingo Bugglebee Presents: Home Alone is an educational game about home safety for multiple systems. Played on a 5 x 5 bingo card, the player is asked multiple choice questions about home safety for every box they select. If the player answers correctly, they get the space and a single point, and are blocked from the space if they answer incorrectly. The player gains 5 bonus points if they score 5 in a row, and Bingo Bugglebee dances for the player. The goal is to score as many points as possible.
