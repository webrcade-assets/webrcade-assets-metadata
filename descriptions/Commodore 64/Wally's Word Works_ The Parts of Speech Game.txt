Wally's Word Works: The Parts of Speech Game is an education word game for multiple systems. The player controls Wally the Wallaby, who hops to different parts of speech while avoiding rovers. Different parts of speech are displayed on the top of the screen, including: adjectives, nuns, pronouns, verbs, interjections, prepositions, adverbs, articles, and conjunctions. The player must hop to different words in the displayed sentences, and then hop to the correct part of speech. There are four rounds of play in each game, and the player starts with 100 points. The player gets 2 attempts to correctly identify each word. The player receives 5 points for getting a word the first try, 3 for the second, and loses 1 point for every wrong try. If the player is caught by a rover, they lose bonus points and a wallaby face. If all faces are lost, the rovers disappear for the rest of the game.
