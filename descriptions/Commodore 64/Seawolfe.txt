Seawolfe is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. The player controls a small ship at the bottom of the screen which moves laterally, and shoots vertically at incoming enemy vessels. Enemy vessels are released from a large ship at the center of the screen, and crisscross horizontally, moving down a row each time they cross. If a ship reaches the bottom of the screen, it destroys one of the marking buoys, which reduces the range of motion of the player. As the player destroys enemy vessels, the ships begin to have a more erratic pattern and move faster. If all buoys are destroyed, it's game over.
