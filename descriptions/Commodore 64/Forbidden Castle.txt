Forbidden Castle is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. If you are the rightful ruler of the Kingdom, and you must find the fabled diamond and right the wrongs of your evil predecessors. The journey to the ancient castle has been arduous, but your motives are unquestionable. You must carefully plan your assault on the well-guarded fortress to successfully recover the fabled diamond, and regain control of the kingdom. The castle has sat unused for over 1,000 years, thereby becoming a haven for roaming giants, serpents, spiders, and mysterious blobs. When you succeed in gaining entrance, Hogarth, your jealous cousin, usurper to the throne, seals the only known access behind you. The player controls a small character who must explore a number of dangerous passageways and rooms within the Forbidden Castle. The player can move in all directions, and is able to pick up some items. The player must avoid enemies, and outsmart numerous traps and monsters to reach the diamond. The player has energy that continuously depletes with movement, and more so with encounters with monsters and traps. The player can temporarily activate shields to protect themselves from dangers. Individual rooms have names and descriptions. When energy runs out, it's game over.
