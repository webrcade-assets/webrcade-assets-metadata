Wizard's Doom is a timed action strategy game with gameplay similar to Soko-Ban. The evil Wizard has imprisoned You in a deep dungeon. Escaping from each of 50 levels requires pushing the movable directional (left, right, up, down, all ways) blocks through the removable walls in order to crush the bricks and get access to all 5 keys. After collecting 5 rusted keys a Magic Key will appear, allowing to pass next level passage doors. All of this within just 3 minutes. The points are awarded for crushing wall bricks, collecting keys and completing levels. Completing 5 levels is awarded with one extra life. The game is very similar to the PC title Wizard's Doom and shares graphics. It is however done by a different developer and it is not clear if one was a licensed or unlicensed port of the other. Most likely the DOS version was released first.
