Turbo Maze Man is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a Pac-Man like creature in a maze trying to eat all the pellets. Four ghosts are released from their homes, and will chase the player if approached too close. Power pellets in the corners of the screen will temporarily send the ghosts back to their homes. If the player clears a level, they advance to a more difficult challenge. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
