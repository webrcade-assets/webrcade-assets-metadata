Toxic Adventure is a side scrolling platform game, in the style of Bobix. The aim of the player is to get all the sacks scattered around the level and get to the final exit chamber. Then escape is possible only after gathering all 180 sacks. The action takes place in a city and it's sewers, inhabited by alien creatures. The only way to avoid them is proper use of jumping skills and selecting safe paths. Access to closed areas requires finding the right lever.
