Aussie Joker Poker is a point scoring card game for 2-90 players. Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and the hand is scored according to poker hand value, card value, and the suits involved. After being dealt a hand, the player is displayed a score. The player can risk discarding cards to acquire a better hand, but if the point value is lessened, the player busts, and they forfeit points for that hand. The player can keep risking drawing new cards to improve their hand until they bust or are satisfied with their score. Card are selecting using the numbers one to five, and they are graphically displayed on the screen. There is an option to display who the current leading hand is each round, and the score to beat. The player can define the number of rounds per game.
