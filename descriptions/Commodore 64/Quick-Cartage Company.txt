Quick-Cartage Company is an educational simulation game that allows students to practice using linear scales to measure distances on maps. The game can be played by up to four players each who is the driver of a truck. The objective is to pick up building materials from supply yards and deliver them to construction sites. It is played on two maps with different scales, one showing a city and one showing the surrounding areas. On the first map each piece of road represents one kilometre while on the second it is three kilometres. Players take turns driving their trucks which is done by entering text commands. First the player enters the direction and then the number of kilometres that should be driven. Upon reaching a supply yard the player can buy material from it but only if there is space left on the truck. Only two items can be carried at a time. Each item costs $50 and upon reaching the right construction site it can be sold for $400. Each construction site has specific materials it needs and will only buy that while each supply yard has two materials. The player with most money when all construction sites have been supplied wins the game. Money can be lost through fines which are given when running out of fuel, crashing or getting a flat tyre. Fuel can be refilled and tyres can be replaced at a garage while after crashing the truck is forced to go to a repair yard.
