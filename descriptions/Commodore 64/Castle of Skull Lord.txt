In the mists of time, the necromantic Skull Lord attacked and defeated a race of Dwarves in a great battle taking many of their treasures including the valuable Crown of Dwarves Kings. Over the ages the Dwarves attempted but failed in their attempts to get back the crown and now turn to a noble warrior to retrieve the crown. You are that warrior and you must travel and explore the vast lands to get the crown and bring it back to the Dwarves whilst defeating the Skull Lord himself. Castle of Skull Lord is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
