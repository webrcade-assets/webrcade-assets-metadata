James Fly is a side-scrolling arcade game. As a James, the fly, the player must scavenge the castle in search for gold coins and other useful items. The screen is divided into two parts - gameplay and informational ones. The bottom part shows acquired points, number of lives and draws a map of a known patch area. James has no weapon, therefore jumping with appropriate run speed adjustment is the only way to avoid contact with numerous hostile creatures.
