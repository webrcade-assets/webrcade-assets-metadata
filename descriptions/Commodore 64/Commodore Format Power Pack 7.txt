Issue 7 of Commodore Format magazine came with a cover-mounted cassette containing three former full-price games, plus 5th Gear from Hewson 's Rack-It label. Shortly after this, a law was passed limiting UK 8-bit magazines to a maximum of 2 former commercial games per issue. The games are: 1. Crystal Castles 2. Uridium 3. Blue Max 4. 5th Gear The provided copy of 5th Gear was bugged, and prone to crashing if the Datasette cassette deck was stopped or knocked. A fixed version was included with issue 28, nearly 2 years later.
