Computer Mastermind is a 2-player strategy board game for the Commodore 64. The player tries to guess a hidden password. Each turn they are told the number of pieces that are correct, and the number that are in the correct position. Codes can be 3 - 6 characters long, and each position can have 3 - 9 different possible characters. Duplication can be permitted or forbidden in the code, and timed games are available. Each player gets up to 8 guesses to solve the puzzle.
