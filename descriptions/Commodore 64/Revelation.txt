Revelation is a sideview shooter scrolling in multiple directions, taking its cue from Revelations, the final book of the Bible. The player is trapped in the caverns of Hell, attempting to locate the Monster of the Apocalypse, with over 40 caverns to pass first. You are constantly dropping downwards without applying thrust to your vehicle, and must avoid any contact with lava pits or other hazards. Foes include the Falcon Fiend, Gorson (The Demon Lord of the Imps) and Belial (The Demon Lord of the Bats). The game can be started from waves 1, 4, 9, 14.
