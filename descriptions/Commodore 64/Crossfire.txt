Crossfire is a single screen first person perspective shooter where you are a policeman leading 'The Untouchables' against the mob lead by Al Capone and 'Legs' Diamond. You must visit nine locations and shoot all the enemies that appear in various places on the screen, by aiming a crosshair at them. Civilians also appear and make you lose points if you happen to shoot them. To complete a location and move to the next one, you must stay alive until a countdown reaches zero. The enemies will shoot back at you after a short time and if you are hit, you lose one of four lives and the scene starts again.
