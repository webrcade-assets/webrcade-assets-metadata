In this ski simulator from Abacus Software, the object of the game is to navigate your skier down a slope to the finish line. Three courses are offered. In "Slalom", you must touch each flag on the way down. "Giant Slalom" is the same, but you are competing for the best time possible. Finally, in "Alps", you must avoid making any contact with trees. You are disqualified for missing a flag, going off the course, or crashing into a tree. Three difficulty levels are offered.
