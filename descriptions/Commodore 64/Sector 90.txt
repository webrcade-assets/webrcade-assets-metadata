Sector 90 is a side scrolling action game where the player has to fight their way into the inner-ring of a concentric-circled enemy base, plant an explosive and escape within 90 seconds. Throughout the game, the player will find various puzzles / locks / keys / enemies to defeat.  The enemies consist solely of a single type of robot, and the puzzles are all very simple (played on the status panel ) and simply involve hitting some sort of 'choose' key at the correct split-second.
