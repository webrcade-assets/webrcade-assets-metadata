Depths of Zimroel is a roleplaying game for the VIC-20. The player must brave the seven levels of Zimroel to slay monsters and gain their gold and treasure.  At the top of the dungeon is the inn, where players can rest and heal. Each character has ratings for strength, intelligence, and dexterity.  Players gain levels as they gain experience, which increases hit points and attributes.  Intelligence affects spell points, and the player can cast heal, zap, invisibility, fry, teleport, and kill. Numerous monsters lurk throughout the dungeon, and these can drop gold, armor, and weapons.  The location of ladders changes each time the player enters the dungeon.
