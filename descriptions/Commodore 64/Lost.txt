It's Year 2048. Pollution of Earth caused by people is still increasing. The World Environment Federation decided to start scientific research to save the planet. A huge laboratory was built on the Moon. However, the computer system failed. The Oxygen left just for a few days. The best pilot must rescue all scientists. The player controls the rescue ship. Movement is carried out using gravitational motors. Starting the engines causes the ship to constantly move at the speed set by the pilot. It is necessary to efficiently maneuver or slow down the ship in turns, because hitting the wall of the base means breaking the ship. When releasing the ship, the player must remember about the passing of time.
