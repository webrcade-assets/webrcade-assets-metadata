Krisp is a variant of the arcade game Nibbler. The game takes place in a series of mazes (60 in total) each full of eggs and other objects. The player controls a snake and has to eat all the eggs to complete a level. As eggs are eaten the size of the snake grows which makes navigation through the maze harder since there is less left space. The snake can make contact with the walls but not with its own body since that leads to a life being lost and the stage has to be restarted. Lives are also lost when a level is not completed before time runs out. The player starts out with five lives with an additional one given upon reaching 50,000 points.
