In Sting 64 Bertie Bee must defend his hive in this action game, taking place across three distinct single-screen parts. You play each of them three times in sequence in amassing a score, but they become harder each time. First, you are presented with a garden of three hives, which are being attacked by other bees. Move around the screen hitting them to stop them reaching their target hive and turning part of it black. Once one of the three hives has been completely turned black, part B begins. Here the enemy bees are trying to steal the honey from inside the hive, and you must guide your swarm of six bees (which are vulnerable to contact) to make contact with the attackers. Part C features defending the Queen Bee from attackers, whose contact with the Queen turns it black. Complete this and the game returns to part one.
