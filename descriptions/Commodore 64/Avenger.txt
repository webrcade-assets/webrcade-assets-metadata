In the sequel to The Way of the Tiger, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame is the villain of the piece. He has killed your foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin. Your quest to recover the scrolls and avenge your father's death is viewed from above and superficially resembles Gauntlet. You start outside the Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards. You can also collect treasure for bonus points as you explore. There are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of shuriken to shoot from a distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hands, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but this can only be used 3 times.
