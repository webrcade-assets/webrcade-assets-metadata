Uptown Trivia is a trivia game for 1 - 8 players. An animated trivia wheel selects the player's question topic, including: History, Arts, Revue, Geography, Science, Sports, and History. For each question, the player receives 1 of 4 potential answers. The player must choose yes or no for each answer, trying to answer the question correctly. If the player answers no for all 4 answers, then they do not receive a point. Players must answer between 1 - 9 questions correctly to finish a category, and the first player to answer the allotted questions in every category is the victor.
