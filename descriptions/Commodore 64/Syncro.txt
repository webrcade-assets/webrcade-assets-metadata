Syncro is a type-in from Commodore Horizons Magazine by Jeff Minter. The player has to control the speed of four conveyor belts that run continuously on screen. On each a goat like bipedal creature called ancipitals is running and the objective is to match the speed of the belt with the running so it runs on the spot on the 'syncro zone' of the belt. Once all four creature are stationary within the syncro zone, the level is finished. Bonus points are awarded and the game proceeds to a new, harder level.
