Maelstrom is a 1-player arcade game for the VIC-20. Storms of the universe. Horrors on the horizon. Lightning bolts and vexing sky visions stalk your base. Clear the sky and weather the maelstrom. The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen that moves laterally and fires vertically. Enemy creatures walk across the screen until they hit a barrier, move down a row, and reverse direction. Some barriers can be shot down while others are invulnerable. Storm clouds fire lighting towards the player. After the player loses 3 lives, it's game over.
