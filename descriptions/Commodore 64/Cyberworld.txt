Cyberworld is an adventure game with arcade elements for the Commodore 64. Welcome to the year 2814. The development of vessels capable of traveling faster than the speed of light has enabled man to begin the exploration and colonization of the near galaxies. Earth, the ancient home planet, her blue seas poisoned and the green forests ravaged in the long ago Andromedan Wards, has been abandoned. Human leaders, with the help of friendly aliens, have united the various peoples into a new one-council league, the Cyberleague, to defend them. The player controls a small character that can move in all directions to explore a number of rooms, and move between areas. The player must avoid enemies or fire at them if the player is armed with a laser. In each room, the player can examine the area, take or pick up objects, search the room, or use an item from their inventory. Items are displayed as numbers, and the player must move towards items to pick them up. A map of explored areas is displayed at the top of the screen. The player can choose 10 levels of difficulty, and game play is divided into several different missions.
