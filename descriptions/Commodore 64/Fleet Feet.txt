Fleet Feet is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Beyond the stars, in a galaxy much like outs, the Spirits of Sportsdom have decreed a need for an intergalactic marathon. They named it Fleet Feet, for it was to be more of a race of swift thinking and fancy footwork. For eons, the best and brightest from every galaxy have met its unique challenge. Now it's your turn. Players control a pair of sneakers that can move horizontally to 4 positions while also moving forwards and backwards on a never-ending conveyor belt of positions. Players try to pick up items on the screen as they approach. Players can compete by themselves, or in 2-player competitive games. There are 12 levels of difficulty, and the player can set track speed, laps per race, steps per lap, and track density.
