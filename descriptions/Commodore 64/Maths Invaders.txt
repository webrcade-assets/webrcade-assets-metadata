Maths Invaders is an educational program that aims to test basic maths in the age range of four to twelve. The object of the game is to shoot down the rows of invaders that are shuffling down the screen. This can be done by giving the right answer to the math problem that appears at the bottom. If the math is solved correctly, the player can shoot the invaders before they can land. You can choose questions on addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or a combination of any of these. Also, a range of difficulty levels can be set.
