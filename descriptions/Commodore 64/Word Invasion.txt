Word Invasion is a 1-player word game for multiple systems. The player controls a multi-tentacled alien while 4 columns of worlds quickly shift towards the player. The player is told they need to find a pronoun, noun, preposition, adjective, or adverb, and must quickly shoot the correct item. If they hit the correct word, the word disappears. If they shoot an incorrect word, a new row quickly filters towards the player. If the words reach the alien, it's game over. The player receives a point for each successful hit, and the goal is to survive as long as possible over 3 rounds
