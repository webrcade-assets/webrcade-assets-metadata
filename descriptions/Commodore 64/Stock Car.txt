Stock Car is a 1â€“2 player top-down arcade racing game for multiple systems. Each player attempts to drive their car around a track while avoiding computer-controlled vehicles, barricades, and other dangers.  The car is controlled by rotating left or right, and the player can accelerate or decelerate, with four gears available.  There are a total of six races to choose from, and the player defines the number of laps and skid factor, as well as if they want oil slicks.
