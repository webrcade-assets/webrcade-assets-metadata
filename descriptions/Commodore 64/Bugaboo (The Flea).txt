A Flea arrives on board of a space probe at the Cebolla-7 planet, an intricate labyrinth of caverns. The objective is to find the exit to each maze-like level. This isn't so easy as the player must ascend very carefully, avoiding protruding rocks and branches and taking care to not fall (which forces the player to start again from the ground level). The only enemy here is a Pterodactilous that will do everything it can to devour the flea. It is not always present, but when it attacks the flea must avoid it.
