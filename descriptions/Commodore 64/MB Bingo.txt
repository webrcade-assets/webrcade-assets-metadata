MB Bingo is a computer Bingo-style game. Players check off numbers on a 5x5 card that are drawn from a bingo machine to match a pattern. It can be played in text mode or graphics mode. It supports printing custom designed bingo cards and up to 99 players. Once the cards have been printed, the program can be run to play the game of bingo, with a custom delay time and the ability to pause the game to check for a winner.
