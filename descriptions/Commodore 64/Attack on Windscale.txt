Attack on Windscale is a combination arcade and text adventure for the Commodore 64. Our 21st Century intergalactic enemies, having been foiled by you and Captain Phoenix in the past and (future) realize that their only chance of defeating us lies in their ability to defeat us in the present. Consequently, they have set up a sonic transmitter somewhere in the surrounding countryside which is causing the atomic core of Windscale to go critical. You and Captain Phoenix must defend the Windscale research centre's atomic core and then find the sonic transmitter before the devastating nuclear explosion rises out of the heart of the English countryside. During the arcade portion, the player controls a gun that moves laterally at the bottom of the screen, and tries to destroy incoming alien vessels. For every 30 vessels destroyed, the player gains an additional gun and an additional clue to the code to access the text adventure component. Aliens become faster and take on new flight patterns each skill level. The player starts with 5 guns. During the text adventure, the player must use the code earned from reaching skill level 4 in the arcade section to start the adventure. The evil aliens have set up a sonic transmitter in the mountains behind Windscale, and the destruction of the base is imminent. All commands are via multiple choice answers, and the player can explore a number of locations graphically displayed on the screen.
