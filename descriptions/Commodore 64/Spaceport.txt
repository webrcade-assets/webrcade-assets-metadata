Spaceport is a 1 - 2 player memory game for multiple systems. The player has been employed as traffic coordinator at a busy space port, and must usher all ships of the Inter-galactic Fleet through the port for refuelling and refitting.  If the player makes a mistake the fleet is destroyed.  There are 9 levels of difficulty from space private to admiral.  At the lowest level, the player sees 2 ships fly into the space port, and must use the menu at the bottom to make sure they exit in order they entered.  At higher levels, more spaceships enter, the time to have them exit is limited, the space port can rotate, and ships can exit from both ends of the port.
