Simon Says is an educational game for young children for multiple systems using the Touchmaster tablet. Children learn body parts, and can design their own faces by pressing items on the Touchmaster tablet.  There are four individual lips, ears, eyes, noses, hair, eyebrows, and moustaches to choose from. These are displayed on the computer screen. In game mode, different parts of the face will twitch or move in order, and the player must remember and repeat what order the items moved.
