Aliens have decided to invade the eight sectors of the Hyperspace Causeway by planting bombs to destroy them. You are a pilot of a spacecraft sent to the sectors to destroy the aliens and their bombs over various levels. The game is viewed from above with each sector shown on the screen and each sector takes the form of a circle with you sat in the middle. The aliens and bombs sit on the edge of the circle and move around the edge to avoid being destroyed. On later levels, circles spin around your craft and need shooting before they explode. Each alien and bomb take the form of different coloured blocks (C64) or shapes (ZX Spectrum) and when shot reacts in various ways to try to hinder you in your mission. This includes splitting into other blocks/shapes or having to be shot before exploding. If you miss a block/shape when shooting, a grey block/circle appears for a short period of time and if shot, the bullet bounces back and hits your craft causing damage. If you reach 100% damage then it is game over. As aliens and bombs appear and disappear when destroyed, the other seven sectors are also having an attempt to be destroyed. On the right of the circle is a box called Lase Scan and this shows decreasing bars for each sector and when a bar empties then that sector is destroyed so you must jump to the sectors to destroy the aliens and bombs. A timer in the bottom left of the screen counts down and when this reaches zero and you have sectors left then you have completed the level and you move onto the next one where more aliens and bombs appear moving faster.
