"The old in-out" as a weary euphemism for a joyless mechanical action was never more apt than here; across five stages, the player is in control of relentless copulatory thrusting, controlled with jerky two-frame back-and-forth movements as first and best set out in Stroker 's classic and elegant interface (or, if you prefer, any of the Daley Thompson / Winter Games era of Olympic athleticism via joystick-waggling). Each movement increases the Lust gauge, while a Potency gauge is ever-diminishing. The player's task is to raise the former to the top before the latter runs out; then a new erotic scenario is unveiled. Lather, rinse (, lather, rinse, lather, rinse) repeat.
