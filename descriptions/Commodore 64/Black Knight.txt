Black Knight takes place in 1980, when an evil sorcerer appeared in the Dunkan's kingdom, settled the abandoned castle and began to rob the local inhabitants. Kidnapping a daughter of the king named Reja forced him to hire a black knight, whose task is to defeat Mephistopheles and rebound from his hands the successor of the throne. As a knight the player must go through the castle, defeat numerous enemies and avoid magical traps. Reaching the next levels requires finding a key that will open the closed bars. Numerous magical items scattered around the castle can be as helpful as a faithful knight's companion - a sword.
