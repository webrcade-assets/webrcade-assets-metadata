Star Command is a 1st person space shooter for the Commodore 64. You are commander of the starship Interceptor, voyaging on the outskirts of the galaxy. Your mission to find a planet suitable as a rest home for retired software authors has been successful. But, as you change course to head home, a meteorite shower threatens to destroy your craft. Played from a 1st person perspective, the player has a crosshair in the center of the screen, and can move in all directions to shoot incoming dangers with its phaser blaster. The ship is armed with fore and rear ultratensile shields that become depleted as the Interceptor takes damage. As the shields are depleted, the ship's hull and navigation controls become damaged. When navigation is depleted the ship loses the ability to move in specific directions. When the hull is fully damaged the ship is destroyed. Between each mission the ship is given a number of repair points which can used to fix some of the damaged systems. During the first round the Interceptor must survive a meteorite shower with a number of quickly incoming rocks. The second round of combat consists of an alien battle fleet, where up to 3 vessels at a time appear at a distance and fire upon the player.
