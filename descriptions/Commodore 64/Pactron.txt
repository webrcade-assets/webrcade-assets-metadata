Pactron is 1-player Pac-Man clone for the Commodore 64. The player navigates a small character through a maze, trying to gobble all the dots. The player must avoid 4 ghosts which originate from the center of the maze. When the player eats one of the power pellets in the corner of the maze, the ghosts become temporarily vulnerable. When all pellets are eaten, the player moves to the next level. There are 3 levels of starting difficulty.
