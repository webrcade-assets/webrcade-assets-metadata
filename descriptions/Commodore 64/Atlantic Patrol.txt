In Atlantic Patrol the player takes control of either a battleship, cruiser or destroyer and must patrol the Atlantic and engage with any hostile ships he or she encounters. The game is played in turns and the player can select from a variety of actions such as changing or maintaining course, changing the speed, attacking, firing torpedoes or scuttling. A picture of the player's ship is shown in the game screen but all feedback and interaction is done textually.
