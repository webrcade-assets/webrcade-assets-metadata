Karapalo emperor, leader of the imperialistic forces, and his vaguely cleaned up lieutenant Darth Water, the cavalier with the most stinky breath of the galaxy, are the responsibles of the most tyrannic government the Universe has ever known. Only few planets and hundreds of men stay rebels to the oppression of the empire. You, Martín Luke Skywalker, are one of them. You live in the Tutuflex planet, a desertic place located thousands of years light from our Solar System. Centuries ago, their inhabitants lived calmly and peacefully without more preoccupations than annually collecting the fruits of the plantations of giant turnips, the only source of wealth of the planet. Tutuflex saw with certain unconcern how the forces of the Empire, long ago a reduced group of mercenaries of the worst kind, became one of the most powerful armies of the universe subduing an always rising number of planets, everything seemed so distant… Until a sad day, the forces of the empire arrived, and before the pacific inhabitants of Tutuflex had time to ask themselves what it was happening, they erased by laser all sign of life and peace of the surface of the planet. Now you are a man without land, without family, without future… in your heart there's only place for resentment and revenge. Having explained this, it would look (and indeed looks) as one of the most dramatic ways to start an adventure, if it wasn't because it's actually a parody of Star Wars ("La Guerra de las Galaxias", not "Vajillas", in Spanish). Besides title, you will also notice that all names of characters, places, etc have been modified in order to make the Spanish user more familiar -in a non-serious way- with them. Add to it that even the most tense situations will have a joke surrounding them, and as a result you have the first integral humorous adventure ever made in Spain.
