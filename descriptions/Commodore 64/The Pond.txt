The Pond is an educational math game for one or two players. Designed to teach children and problem solving, the player must recognize and design a pattern to help a frog cross a field of lily pads. The player has 35 turns spread out over three stages of lily pads. Once the player believes they have discovered the pattern, they must chose which direction and how many steps the frog must repetitively follow to complete the pattern. If the frog falls into the water, it's game over. There are six levels of difficulty, which can involve 2,3, or 4 step patterns.
