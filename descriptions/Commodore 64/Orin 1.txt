Orin 1 is a game similar to Lunar Lander. The moons of planet Alfa have been mined and if the mines are not destroyed the moons might explode. To destroy the mines the player has to fly his shuttle over the moon surface and use the shuttle's gas burner right above them. Thrust is used to move the shuttle left, right and up. Any contact with the surface will lead to the shuffle exploding. The moon has 29 mines and it's supposed to take 20 minutes to fly around it. For each mine destroyed the player earns points and when they're all gone he is sent to another moon with different gravity and new difficulties. The player has three shuttles and when they are all destroyed the game ends.
