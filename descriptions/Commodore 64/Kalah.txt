Kalah is a digital translation of the 1940s board game of the same name. The game is played with two players or against the computer's AI. Both players have six houses and a store which lie opposite to each other. Each house is filled with an equal amount of seeds at the start of the game (the amount is up to the player). Each turn a player may pick up all the seeds in a single house and place them in the other houses and his or her store in a clockwise motion (adding one for each location). The goal of the game is to get as many seeds in the player's own store. When the player picks a house in such a way that the final seed falls in the store he or she is rewarded another turn. If the last seed falls in an empty house owned by the player and the opposite house contains seeds, the player puts all those seeds including his or her own in the store. The game ends when a player no longer can make any moves.
