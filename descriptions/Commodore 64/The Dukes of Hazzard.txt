Based on the television series, this has the Duke boys competing in  the Annual Hazzard County Cross Country Road Race to win the $5,000 prize in order to to stop Boss Hog from taking their car, the General Lee.  But the Hazzard County police and Hogg try to prevent them from doing so. The General Lee is controlled on a side-scrolling road, going from left to right and can change lanes and speed. You can destroy enemy cars and avoid hazards by jumping. Helicopters fly over and shoot at you, as well as airplanes and balloons. You can throw dynamite sticks to destroy obstacles and enemies also. But be sure to avoid Daisy in her Jeep.
