Starace is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a spaceship that moves in all directions and fires directly forwards.  The player starts with 5 lives.Game play is divided into 5 separate galaxies, each with a different challenge: Galaxy 1: There are 3 alien space ships that are protected by Federations rules, and the player's quark lazer is disabled.  The player must navigate their ship to avoid the 3 aliens vessels which continuously chase the player. Galaxy 2: The galaxy is filled with asteroids and stray fireballs, and the player must avoid these.  The ship's lazers will not destroy these. Galaxy 3: This galaxy has a high gravitational pull, and the player's mothership has been called to transport the player.  The player must navigate their ship into a tractor beam, which slowly pulls the player's ship vertically, but the ship descends when not in the beam. Galaxy 4: The player confronts the alien mothership, which shoots a stream of missiles vertically downwards.  The player must shoot it 20 times, and the enemy ship speeds up each time it's hit. *Galaxy 5: The player's ship must land on the alien planet.  Gravity pulls the ship downwards, and thrusters can be used to assist against gravity.  The player must avoid horizontally moving obstacles.
