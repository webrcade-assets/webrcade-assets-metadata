Your countries Embassy in war-torn Moldavia is under siege and the people inside need urgent help. At this moment in time they cannot be rescued but supplies can be taken and dropped by helicopter to keep them going until a solution can be found. You are Joe Starbuck and you have been tasked to pick up supplies and drop them on the Embassy in your helicopter over various levels. The game is a horizontal side view shooter that scrolls constantly from right to left. You must avoid and shoot helicopters in the air as well as avoiding bullets and shells fired from the ground by soldiers and gun placements. If you touch a helicopter or are shot then you lose one of three lives. As well as your cannon you also have three smart-bombs which when used kill everything on screen and more can be picked up in various places. As you fly you will find the supplies that need picking up and once picked up you must fly onto the embassy and drop them in the area. The level is completed when you reach the far left of the level. If you fail to pick up the supplies or drop them, then you lose a life.
