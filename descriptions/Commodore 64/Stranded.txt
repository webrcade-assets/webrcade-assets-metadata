Stranded is a graphical adventure for multiple systems. The year is 2510 A.D., and your name is Special Agent Sid of the S. A. S. Your Starship 'The Excalibur' slowly drifts through intergalactic space on course for Earth. You are quietly relaxing at the starship controls while enjoying a bottle of 50 year old Scotch in celebration of yet another dangerous mission. Suddenly you feel a stabbing pain in your back. A tranquilizer dart. You collapse on the floor unconscious, and when you awaken, you find yourself stranded on a strange planet. Your mission is to return home safely. The player must explore the alien planet looking for items to repair and refuel a spaceship. All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.
