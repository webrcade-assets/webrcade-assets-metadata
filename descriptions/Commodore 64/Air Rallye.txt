Air Rallye is a flight game for the Commodore 64. The player controls an airplane from a 3rd person perspective, and has to take off, fly around a number of rally points, and return to the starting runway in the minimum time. The player can create custom maps to set their own rally points. The player monitors the plane's speed, RPMs, altitude, heading, fuel, and visibility to safely pilot their aircraft.
