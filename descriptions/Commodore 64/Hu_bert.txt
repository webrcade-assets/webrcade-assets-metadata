The game is another variant of Q*bert. The goal is the same - to change all tiles on a pyramid made of cubes to the target color. To do this you guide Hubert around the pyramid, and every tile he jumps on will change color. The number of jumps may vary based on level's number. But you should be careful because there are several foes, which will prevent you from completing levels. They are:* Red Ball: it is lethal, avoid it Purple Ball: it is lethal and gives rise to creatures Worm: it destroys your work, jump over it Rissou: identical to Worm Sleuth: it is tracking you and it is lethal, avoid it Nasty: it walks on his own way and it is indestructible and lethal There are also bonuses; picking it up, you can for a short time eat sleuths. There are three speeds of the game. The best scores will be written in Hi-Scores table.
