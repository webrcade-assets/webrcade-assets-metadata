You are a Bio-Mechanical Fighting Toad and you have been sent to a planet containing the central computer to an advanced defense system to destroy it. You start on the surface and you must go deeper below the surface over five levels with your Jet-pack and laser destroying aliens to face the computer. The atmosphere doesn't suit you and will drain various important levels like H2, PU and O2 but in places scattered around the whole planet are bottles to collect to keep your levels topped up. The Jet-Pack has power which is drained by touching aliens, hit by bullets or hitting obstacles. Once the power or a level reaches zero then it is game over. A temperature gauge also needs watching as this affects your Toad. Toad Force is a horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from the side where you can move left or right and the screen scrolls when you move. Each level can be moved to via gaps in the surface or ceiling. A joystick is used to control your toad.
