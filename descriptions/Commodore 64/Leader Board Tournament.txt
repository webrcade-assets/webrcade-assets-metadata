Leaderboard Tournament is the sequel to Leaderboard which follows the same format as the original but now has four new courses to play on. Up to 4 players can play up to 72 holes on each course with three skill levels (novice, amateur or professional). The game is viewed behind the golfer with the course stretching out into the distance. You can adjust which club to use as well as which direction you want to hit your shot. Once you're happy with your selection, you press fire to initiate the shot. A bar will move and when you're happy with how much power you want, you press fire again. When the bar moves to the middle, you press it again. Get it in the middle and you won't slice or hook the shot. On novice, you don't have to worry about this.
