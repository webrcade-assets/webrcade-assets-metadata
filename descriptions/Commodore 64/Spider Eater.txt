Spider Eater is a musical learning game for children. The spiders are invading the treble clef, and the child needs to hit the right notes to protect it from the spiders. Children will develop ear, eye, and hand coordination, and develop relative pitch and interval perception. Children will also learn the notes on the keyboard, the musical staff, and note and pitch recognition. The game supports the Koala Pad which is a touch tablet that interacts with the game.
