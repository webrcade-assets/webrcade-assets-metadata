Sea Horse Hide'n Seek is an educational action game for children. 1 or 2 players can participate. You have to help a little seahorse to get to the shipwreck at the far right of the screen, while avoiding lagoon-fishes which try to take the seahorse out of the screen. The seahorse can hide in tunnels, automatically bringing the seahorse to a different location. However, there is always an octopus hiding in a cave. The seahorse can also hide in corals, as long as they match the seahorse's colour.
