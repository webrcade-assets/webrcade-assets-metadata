This educational game attempts to endear basic mathematics to young school children by using liberal amounts of... cake. Five mini-games are included, all based on the theme of a bakery, where the sugary dessert can only be prepared by means of solving simple calculations. The first three exercise basic arithmetics through counting, dividing and distributing cakes; then there's a Flash Cards-type game that presents a series of problems (according to the chosen type and difficulty) to be solved in a guided manner. The final game tasks 1 to 4 players with catching falling cakes in mid-air, by giving the correct answers as quickly as possible - before they go splat and mess up the floor!
