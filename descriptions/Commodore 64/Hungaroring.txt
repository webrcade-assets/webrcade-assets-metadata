This title features Formula 1 racing on the Hungaroring track, in a Pole Position manner, except the timer is not counting down but up. Your score is determined by the time of your run. Gears have to be shifted manually, there are 4 speeds. You can select how many laps you want to go and how many other cars are on the track. Training run lets you go 1 round without other racers. The game has separate Hungarian and English language releases and two alternate C64 iterations.
