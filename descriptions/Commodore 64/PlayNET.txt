An early online service that laid down the technical framework for the later Quantum Link, PlayNET featured a GUI which (among other activities) allowed for easy play of parlour games against real players in remote locations, all through the very narrow bottleneck of early '80s ~300 baud modems. Thirteen games included on the disk, distributed (in some areas) with new Commodore 64 computers, included: Backgammon, Boxes, Capture the Flag, Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Contract Bridge, Four in a Row, Go, Hangman, Quad 64, Reversi, and Sea Strike
