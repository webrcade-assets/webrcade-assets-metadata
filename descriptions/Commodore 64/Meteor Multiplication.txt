Meteor Mission is a space-themed arcade game designed to teach math skills. The player controls a small space station which can spin in a circle and shoot in eight separate directions. Meteors with mathematical equations approach the player, and the player must shoot the correct equation to reset its trajectory. If the player shoots the wrong meteor it approaches faster. When a meteor strikes the player's space station, it's game over.
