Konfl1kt was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 1k size category. It is a game for two players where they face each other each on a side of the screen. Every joystick controls one player and either the top or bottom border of the playfield. The controlled border has got the same colour as the player and pushing the joystick up or down makes the player's character move. Pressing fire releases up to three shots. Pushing the joystick towards or away the opponent makes the border move up or down, meaning the opponent can be pushed into the player's fire by using border movement. The fire button can be held for unlimited shots, but it needs to be released to let the bullets travel far enough or they will not hit the opponent.
