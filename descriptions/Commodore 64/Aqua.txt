Aqua is a 2-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Each player controls a diver that tries to collect pearls from the bottom of the ocean.  The divers move laterally, can drop down between platforms, and can jump up to higher platforms above.  Platforms move laterally across the screen, and the player has limited oxygen, and must return to their starting vessel when oxygen runs low.  Various denizens of the deep provide additional danger.  When all pearls are collected the screen refills.  Each player has 3 lives, and when all lives are lost the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.
