Long ago, the Magister created the world and all its creatures. One creature rebelled against his control, man. The Magister watched with bemusement as man increased with number before deciding to sleep beneath a hill in England. A castle was built upon the hill, called Castle Eternity. Eventually, in medieval times, man awoke the Magister from his slumber, but his power had seeped into the land. So he bade his time until the day of a great feast, held by your father, the king. There the Magister turned the castle's inhabitants into all manners of ghoul and beast, but thankfully you and your sibling were outside the castle at the time. Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your twin sibling from the evil Magister. Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.
