Passport to Paris is an arcade and strategy game. Welcome to Paris. You are a tour guide in charge of 12 very enthusiastic tourists. Unfortunately, you have just received a message that their flight will be leaving an hour earlier than scheduled. You need to track down all 12 tourists, or be responsible for them missing their return flight. The player must investigate 6 separate tourist sites in Paris. Each location contains a mini-game, and the player must locate the tourists and their names in each section. The player will also receive clues as to where each tourist is located. Mini-game sections include: navigating the lines of tourists at the Louvre, lighting candles at the Notre Dame, talking to waiters at the Moulin Rouge, listening to music at the opera, talking to artists at Montmarte, and finding tourists at the Eiffel Tower. The player has 200 francs and 12 hours to find the missing items. The player can travel by bus, taxi, metro, or walking. All 4 options use a different amount of time and money. The game is over when the player has run out of money or time, or has collected all missing items.
