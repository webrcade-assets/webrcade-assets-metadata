Hired Sword 2 is a slightly erotic role-playing game. Inspired by the Leisure Suit Larry series with visuals evoking Ultima IV, you are a broke mercenary trying to find the seductive elf who stole your heart. This comedic game offers the lands of Kadazanos and Glammorill to explore, with almost thirty different locations. Equipment in the game is randomly generated, with over 1,000 different combinations of weapons and armour available.
