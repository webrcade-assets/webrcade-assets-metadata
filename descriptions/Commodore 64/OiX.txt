OiX is an adaptation of tic-tac-toe, played versus the computer on a 20 by 20 board. The goal is to arrange five O's or X's in a row. The human player can choose if he wants to be O's or X's, and whether he wants to go first. A symbol is placed by typing in the coordinates of the chosen square of the board.
