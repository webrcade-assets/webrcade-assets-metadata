Fiona Rides Out is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Fiona is a witch, the foulest witch ever to darken the skies of her coven. Her sister witches have stolen the tools of her trade and she wants them back. To do this she must ride the night skies searching various locations for her precious belongings. Levels are divided into 2 different types: a horizontal scrolling level aboard the witches' broom to travel to a new location and a single screen where the player must gather the missing belonging. The two types alternate each level. The player has limited magical energy each level, which can not be replenished on flying levels. If the player loses all energy they are sent to hell, which is a series of tight twisting caverns and fireballs. If the player is safely able to escape from hell without hitting an obstacle, then they can restart the same level without losing a life. The player starts with 5 lives, and a life is only lost by failing to escape hell. A sample from the poem "Ruddigore" is presented between each level. In the travelling section, the player can move in all directions and fire directly forwards. The player must avoid a host of dangers including thunder clouds, other witches, bats, ghosts, and bouncing mushrooms. The goal is to last for a specific time period required to reach the destination. Upon arriving at a destination, the player can float and shoot forwards, and must combat a variety of horror themed enemies. When an enemy is shot, they briefly becomes magic sparkles, which can be gathered by the player and deposited in the cauldron at the right of the screen to increase magical energy. The player can not shoot while carrying the energy. Once enough energy is gathered, one of Fiona's possessions are recovered, and the player advances to the next stage.
