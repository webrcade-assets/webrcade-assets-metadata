Piloting a small helicopter, you fly through a tunnel. The only way to control your vehicle is to keep pressing Fire, which causes it to move upwards; the faster you press, the faster the chopper gains height. You have therefore to adjust your tempo so that you won't collide with the tunnel walls. Flapper was an entry in the 1024 Bytes Game Compo 2nd Edition, where it took 3rd place.
