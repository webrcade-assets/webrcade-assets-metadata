Israel's Golden Years is the fourth and final game in Series 2 of the Baker Street Kids franchise, with stories written by father/son duo V. Gilbert Beers and Ronald Beers. It consists of 15 Bible stories, starting with the deaths of Saul and his sons and ending with the rebellion of Israel against Solomon's son Rehoboam. Bible passages: First Book of Samuel, Chapter 31; Second Book of Samuel; First Book of Kings, Chapter 3 through Chapter 12, verses 1-20; First Book of Chronicles, Chapters 10-29; and Second Book of Chronicles, Chapters 1-10. After selecting one of fifteen stories, you are given a choice of one of three difficulty levels: Tough, Very Tough, or Super Tough. For each story selection, you get to read the story (some of them riddled with typos and some inaccuracies in Bible translation), and then answer several questions about it, consisting of choosing one of three options. Frequently the questions will be true or false questions, but because there are three options, one option will be "who knows?", "doesn't say", "maybe", "don't know", etc. -- which is guaranteed to be wrong. Once you get at least most of the answers right, you are treated to a little light animation.
