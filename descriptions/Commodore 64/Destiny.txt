Destiny is an arcade game, where the player must find 9 poison containers scattered around the maze, while avoiding numerous inhabitants. Contact with any of the creatures takes an energy, which can't be complemented. No weapon is available, therefore a smooth movement is the key to avoid hostile beings, blocking the transition to other parts of the labyrinth.
