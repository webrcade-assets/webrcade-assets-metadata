You play as a stormcloud.  The player can move vertically in the middle of the screen, and are able to shoot lightning bolts horizontally to the left and to the right.  Surrounding the player on the lateral sides of the screen are a series of bombs, which will return fire at the player.  A stage is cleared when all enemy bombs are destroyed, but the player will lose a life if struck by opposing fire. The player starts with a total of 5 clouds, and gains a new storm cloud for every 2000 points they earn.  The player gains 100, 200, 300, and 500 points for each stage cleared, and there are a total of 5 stages of increasing difficulty. Thunderbombs was later released as part of Penguin Software's Arcade Album #1.
