Yachtingâ€™s most prestigious event is brought to life in this simulation of the 24.3 mile course off Perth that it used at the time. As in the real event, you will have to navigate accurately and steer precisely, using Genoa and spinnaker winching in your 12-metre yachts. You can choose between 7 pre-set nations or enter your own name. Before you compete, you will see the course maps the wind conditions, and must choose your sails based on this information. The constantly-moving sea helps guide you.
