Fliptris is is a variant of classic Tetris game. Each level requires completing designated number of puzzles rows (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) of the same pattern. The game shows an incoming block. The block can be moved to the left or to the right, while the pattern on the blocks may be moved up and down. Each completed row disappears and discovers a part of a hidden image. Discovering the entire image moves to the next level.
