Clowning Around is a memory game for multiple systems. The player is given 16 spaces where 5 different items are seeded randomly. A few seconds are allowed to memorize their location, and then the spaces become blank. The player must locate the item displayed on the bottom right of the screen by maneuvering a clown to the correct number of the item's location. The goal is to discover all 16 hidden items. There are five item categories: fruit, fish, insects, flowers, and digits.
