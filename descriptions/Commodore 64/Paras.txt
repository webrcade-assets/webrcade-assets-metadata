Your troops have been deployed behind enemy lines. Their first task is to secure a line of retreat by taking out all of the nearby enemy. Their final objective is to destroy a vital enemy bridge. Paras is a turn based squad-level tactical combat game. You start a level by placing and arming 15 soldiers on a top-down map. Turns take place in three phases: movement, action and enemy action. Movement may occur while the soldier is standing, or prone. Actions include firing on enemies, preparing and throwing grenade, and laying/detonating explosives to take out the bridge. During the game, your troops may come under artillery fire, but may lie prone to reduce the effects of the shock wave and shrapnel. There are ten levels of difficulty. The first five only have the bridge scenario, while the second five require you to clear a screen of enemy soldiers before getting to the bridge.
