Gold-Dust Island is a strategy game for 2 - 5 players. The players have been stranded on a gold laden tropical island, with their job being to collect as much gold as possible before escaping the island via boat. The island contains a well for drinking water, a forest for boat building, and a gold field. Each turn, a player can either move between different locations, dig for gold, work on building a boat, fill their well, fetch water, or trade with each other. Gameplay time is limited by a tropical cyclone which will destroy all human life on the island if not escaped in time. The players have a limited supply of water, starting with 10 days worth. If they run out of water, they will die of dehydration, thus water supplies need to be maintained. The player who successfully builds a boat and has the most gold prior to the cyclone arriving is victorious.
