Cyberworm is an uncomplicated adventure game, where you take control of a cyborg sent to infiltrate a company and retrieve some documents. There are several maze-like levels to traverse. You move around them, trying to find necessary items and locate the exit. There are guards in some rooms who may very well kill you. There are almost no graphics - all you get are exits written on the screen. The interface is limited to the buttons in the bottom-left corner and your face in the top-right corner.
