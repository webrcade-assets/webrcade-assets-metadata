Zauberschloß (subtitle "An adventure game with perils") is a German language adventure game. The player enters a heavily guarded castle with many dangers. The task is to snatch the crown of a magician, and thus end his reign over the people. The quest is completed once the crown has been safely brought out of the castle. To solve the task, the player can enter commands with the keyboard which the computer will execute, provided they're understood. These commands usually consist of two words, which must be separated by a space, the following work: NIMM (take), VERLIERE (drop), LIES (read), OEFFNE (open), VERJAGE (chase away), DREH (turn), BENUTZE (use), TRINK (drink), DRUECKE (press) For directions, only the first letter has to be entered: N = Nord (north), S = Süd (south), W = West (west), O = Ost (east), H = Hoch (up), R = Runter (down) The LIST command lists all things that the player is carrying, up to four at once. With SAVE the game can be saved. On the C64, the graphics mainly consist of the default C64 character set, only a few items and opponents have been rendered as sprites, which then immediately stand out from the other graphics. Below the graphics the objects in the room are listed. Below this the possible walk-directions are displayed. The last line is the command line, in which the two-word commands can be entered.
