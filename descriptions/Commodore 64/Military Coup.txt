Military Coup is a strategy game for one player where you attempt to take over a city from the current Government run by President Xerxes, by trying to take over the streets and prominent buildings. There are five skill levels to choose from as well as the type of Government you want to take over and the type you will be if you succeed and they are Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Rightwing and Fascist. After your choices, you are shown a list of the 15 prominent buildings which include a Radio Station, Airport, Hospital and Cathedral. The President's Palace is also included but the chances of taking this over is very slim. The list of buildings also show which side they would support and the likelihood of changing sides which changes every game. You now see a map of the city shown on the whole screen in the form of squares on a 11 x 7 grid with each square representing a street and the buildings in neutral grey. You now have four moves to take over either a street or a building and you can get a intelligence report on a building for free. If you succeed in a takeover then the building or street turns into your colour which is either red or blue, but if you fail then you lose all your remaining turns. Once your go is over, the computer now attempts to takeover, and when finished you are shown the news and other buildings or streets can change colour or change sides after both goes are completed. You keep selecting buildings and streets and you can select ones that the computer owns. Points are awarded for certain successful moves and the winner of the game is the first to 35 points.
