Quest for the Garden of Eden is a combination arcade and text adventure spread over 2 cassettes for the Commodore 64. Your quest is to go back in time in order to find The Garden of Eden and stop Adam from eating that apple. During the arcade section, the player controls a small character who can move laterally, jump, and duck. The goal is to cross a bridge to gather rocks that block the entrance to the right. These rocks can then be dropped on enemies below the bridge for additional points. The player must jump over the spider that patrols the bridge, duck the venomous serpent, and avoid fire from the fish in the water below. If a rock is dropped on the bumblebee, it'll attack. Once all rocks are cleared, the player can advance to the next skill level. The player must reach skill level 4 to get the hints required to complete the text adventure. In the text adventure, the player must through different time zones to reach the time portal of that age. They will encounter contemporary Earth, Sherwood Forest, ancient Egypt, and finally the Garden of Eden where they prevent Adam from eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. All commands are via VERB NOUN entry. The is no save/restore feature.
