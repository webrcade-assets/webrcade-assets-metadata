Galleons is a 1 - 4 player sailing and adventure game for the Commodore 64. Each player is put in charge of a sailing ship and a crew of 12 men. The player can choose gentleman or rogues for their crew mates. Gentleman demand 10% of the final bounty per sailor, while rogues charge 1 guinea per turn. The player sails about a large scrolling world of oceans and islands. A map feature allows the sailor to plan out their movement. The ship can raise sails to travel with the winds or lower sails to enter port, represented by an anchor point near islands. Wind direction and speed is represented at the top right of the screen, and the player has movement points based upon wind strength, but can not sail directly into the wind. Sailing into rocks causes the ship to sink and it's game over. The player can find treasure to increase their wealth on the islands. The rogues can be negotiated with, and the player can set their pay rate per turn. Enemy pirates can appear as white ships that move quickly across the screen. The player must quickly fire upon and destroy them, or risk losing crew. If the player runs out of crew or guineas, it's game over.
