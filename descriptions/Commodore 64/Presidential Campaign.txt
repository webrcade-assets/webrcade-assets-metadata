Presidential Campaign is a 1 - 4 player strategy game for the Commodore 64. Each player takes control of their own American presidential campaign 124 days before election day. Each turn, the player can choose to visit a state by land or air in order to campaign and explain your platform. By doing this, the player can try to shore up votes for election night. Random events happen each turn, and the player must carefully monitor their campaign finances. The player must choose their campaign platform based upon a number of options, and can perform campaign research to poll states, determine state voter history, and votes remaining in states.
