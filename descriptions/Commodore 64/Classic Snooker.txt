Tournament Snooker allows one or two players to play a game of snooker from a top-down view. The player first selects the ball to be hit, then adjusts the spin on the cue ball and the power of the shot, finally nominates a color after a legal pot. There are three levels of difficulty. Commodore 64 and Plus/4 users may also enter into an edit mode, where they can set up the table.
