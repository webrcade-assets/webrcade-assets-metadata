Alloyrun is a 2D side-scrolling shooter in which the player controls a futuristic ship and has to shoot enemies as they approach from the right, in order to gain points. The ships is always facing the same direction, meaning it can only shoot to the right, but it can be freely moved around the screen. There are also hazards and barriers in the environment that needed to be avoided. The game keeps track of the highscore.
