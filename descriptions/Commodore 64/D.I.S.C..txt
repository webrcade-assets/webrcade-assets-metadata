D.I.S.C. is a horizontally scrolling shooter in which the player has to fly a space craft through four levels fighting off various enemy formations. Enemies differ in speed and size and follow different attack patterns. Colliding with enemies or a projectiles decreases the space crafts energy. Items that replenish energy can be collected as well as shields that decrease the amount of damage taken from collisions. Other items include smart bombs, a more powerful shot and a side-laser. At the end of each level, a boss has to be defeated.
