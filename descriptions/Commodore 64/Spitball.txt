Spitball is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Two worm-like characters can move clockwise or counterclockwise around two tracks. The characters can move between tracks, and if they touch their opponent, they lose a life. The player can shoot balls into the center of the screen, which bounce off the deflections within the center, and bounce out the side of the level. There are teleporters, which can move the computer opponent around the level. The goal is to strike the opponent to pass the level. Each level is timed, and the player has to hit their opponent to move to the next challenge. The player has 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
