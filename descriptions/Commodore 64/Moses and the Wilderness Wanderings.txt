Moses and the Wilderness Wanderings is the first game in Series 2 of the Baker Street Kids franchise, with stories written by father/son duo V. Gilbert Beers and Ronald Beers. It consists of 15 Bible stories, depicting the birth of Moses, the Plagues of Egypt and the Exodus, and the journey through the wilderness for forty years. Bible passages: The Book of Exodus; and the Book of Numbers, Chapters 13 and 14 and Chapters 20-24. After selecting one of fifteen stories, you are given a choice of one of three difficulty levels: Tough, Very Tough, or Super Tough. For each story selection, you get to read the story (some of them riddled with typos and some inaccuracies in Bible translation), and then answer several questions about it, consisting of choosing one of three options. Frequently the questions will be true or false questions, but because there are three options, one option will be "who knows?", "doesn't say", "maybe", "don't know", etc. -- which is guaranteed to be wrong. Once you get at least most of the answers right, you are treated to a little light animation.
