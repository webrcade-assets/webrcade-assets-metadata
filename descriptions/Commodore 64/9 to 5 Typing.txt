9 to 5 Typing is an educational game for learning 10 finger typing on the C64. In one of the typing games, a woman is running away from a man. When you take too long time to type the random words, the man will catch her. If you type fast enough she will successfully run away from him. In another typing game a woman will swing a lasso. When you type fast enough she will throw the lasso around the neck of the man standing opposite of her.
