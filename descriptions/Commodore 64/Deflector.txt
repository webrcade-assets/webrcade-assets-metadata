Deflector is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player moves about a maze filled with diamonds, while trying to destroy two robots and a space spider. The robots will always fire a laser towards the player if they are aligned, and the player can activate their deflector suit to deflect the beam to the direction they are facing. This must be done to destroy the spider and 2 robots on each level. The player has limited energy for their deflector suit for each level, and can gain bonus points by picking up diamonds. The space spider does not shoot, and can only be destroyed by deflection. A single hit, and it's game over.
