Fire Trap is a 1-player science fiction themed arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and can fire forwards. Three alien vessels move about the screen, and fire vertically downwards. As an alien vessel is destroyed, a new one immediately takes its place. If the player is hit, they lose a spaceship. The player starts with 3 vessels, and it's game over when all are lost.
