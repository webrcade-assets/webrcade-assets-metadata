Orion is a 1-player action game for the Commodore 64. You have been trapped in the solar system Orion with your spaceship. The ship must navigate a large maze covering multiple connected screens trying to find the 18 hidden energy pills, and can fire laterally left and right, and move in all directions. A number of dangers fill the maze including laser fields, moving walls, robots, and bubbles. The player starts with 9 lives, and loses one if they hit any danger or wall.
