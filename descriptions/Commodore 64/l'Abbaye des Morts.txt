Collect the twelve Cathar crosses to expel the evil from this building. l'Abbaye des Morts (Abbey of the Dead) is a game designed to look and control like a ZX Spectrum game. It's gameplay is inspired by games like Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy. You must move through room after room to find and gather the twelve crosses. Red hearts will grant you extra lives and stone pillars with a cross near the top act as checkpoints. Ring bells or move switches to open further passages. Avoid anything that is moving as it's touch will lose you a life. Lose all your lives and the game is over.
