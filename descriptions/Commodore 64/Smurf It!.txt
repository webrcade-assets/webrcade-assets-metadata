Smurf It! was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 4k size category. This is a simple sliding puzzle game, made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Smurfs' creation and containing two Smurf pictures. At the beginning, you have a 5-second peek at the picture, and then it gets shuffled randomly. Once one picture is completed, the other one appears. The puzzle pieces can be moved with a joystick. Moving the joystick to the right will move the piece which is to the left of the blank space, moving it down will move the piece above the blank space, etc.
