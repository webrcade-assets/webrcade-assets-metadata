Rubicon is a side-scrolling run-and-gun shooter in which the goal is to traverse five levels in order to reach a cache of nuclear weapons and check on their integrity. Standing in the player's way are various creatures mutated by radiation as well as military hardware like tanks, helicopters and walkers. The player's gun cannot be upgraded, but one level offers a jetpack power-up and another the possibility to ride a captured creature. To unlock the weapons vault, the player must collect four "SW units" found in the levels. The 16-bit version of Rubicon, despite being billed as a port, has nothing in common with the C64 version besides the basic premise.
