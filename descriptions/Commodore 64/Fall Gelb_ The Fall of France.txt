Designed for 1 - 2 players, each player controls the major land forces of either the Axis or Allied players. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is from a corps level commander, and the player assigns movement and combat tasks for those groups, and responds to operational events.

All games begin in on May 10, 1940, and game time lasts 10 - 20 turns, with each turn encompassing 2 days time. Each break allows the player to input new commands for their forces, but will stop to allow the player to react to enemy movements.
