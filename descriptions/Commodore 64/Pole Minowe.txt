Pole Minowe is a board game requiring the crossing of a playfield from the left to right border without stepping on a mine before the time runs out. The player is equipped with a sound mine detector. Being close-up near the mines is signaled by an audible signal. Selecting the right direction is the main challenge during gameplay. The game features ten unique boards, that get repeated all over again with various mine relocations.
