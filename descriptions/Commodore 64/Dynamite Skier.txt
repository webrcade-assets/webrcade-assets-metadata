Dynamite Skier is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. You've been strapped to leaky dynamite and sent skiing down a steep hill. The player can move to the left or right to avoid obstacles, and the further down the hill they travel the faster obstacles approach. Icy patches will make the player spin out of control, and rocks or trees will cause the player to explode. The player has 5 lives, and score is based upon the number of feet travelled.
