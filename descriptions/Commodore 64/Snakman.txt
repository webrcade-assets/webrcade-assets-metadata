Snakman is a Pac-Man clone for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64. The player controls a small character that tries to gobble all the dots in a maze while avoiding the ghosts that move randomly about. When the player eats a power pellet all ghosts become temporarily vulnerable. When all pellets are consumed, the player goes to a level where the ghosts move faster. The player starts with 3 lives.
