Super Trek is an adaptation of Star Trek. The game is mostly identical with the player in control of the Enterprise on the hunt for Klingons in space. Like in the previously mentioned game the player can scan, move and fire torpedoes. New is the ability to fire phasers. The player can select an amount of energy to spend on the attack. Like torpedoes, energy is in limited supply so players must not go overboard with them. This version does not feature sound.
