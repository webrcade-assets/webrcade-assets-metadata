This game was made with SEUCK (Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit). As the pilot of an assault fighter, you should fly over the hostile territory presented in a scrolling top-down view. Starting over the sea, you will travel through different places such as fortified roads, airfields, green plantations, etc. During your perilous flight enemy helicopters, planes, cars, and fixed guns will try to eliminate you, so you should eliminate your opponents and gain points.
