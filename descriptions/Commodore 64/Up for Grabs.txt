Up for Grabs is a 1 - 4 player word game for multiple systems. A spinning cube in the center of the screen continuously brings up new letters. Each player has a board in the corner of the screen, and players can pick up letters as they appear in the cube, with each letter able to go to only 1 player. Letters can be rearranged on the individual 4 x 4 boards to spell words horizontally and vertically, but the cube keeps spinning and other players can obtain new letters during this time. Gameplay is divided into 4 quarters, and during intermissions unwanted letters can be discarded. The final score is tallied at the end of the game based upon all words on the board minus the value of unused letters. There are 4 levels of gameplay.
