This is a remake of the Atari 2600 game Frogs and Flies, which was a redoing of the Intellivision game Frog Bog. As before, you are a frog leaping into the air to catch flies for points until the sun goes down. On the 'Beginner' setting, you jump in a fixed arc and never hit the water. In the 'Advanced' setting, you control the jump and can land in the water where you have to wait to swim back to the pad. Unlike the previous version, there is no automatic tongue. You must always press the button to shoot out the tongue. Also, there is a white fly that, when eaten, loses you points.
