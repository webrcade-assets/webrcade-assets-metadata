Nuclear Power Plant is a simulation game in which the player is in control of a nuclear power plant. The goal is to make energy without letting things run out of control. Each day in the game the player can set the position of the control rods and determine the flow of various cooling systems. The next day the player gets to see the fruit of his or her labors and try to improve on (or fix) the actions of the previous day. There are many variables the player must bear in mind such as turbine capacity, coolant levels, maintenance, extreme temperatures and possible meltdown.
