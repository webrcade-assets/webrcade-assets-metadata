Triple Decker 8 is a compilation of the following games (all developed by the same company, Mr Chip Software): Super Snake Simulator Project X Fearless Fred and the Factory of Doom (listed on the cover as Fearless Fred) The following two games were released for the first time within this compilation: Super Snake Simulator - A variant of the popular Snake game concept. The player controls a snake which is constantly moving forward, and must be careful not to run into a wall or into the snake's own tail. On each level the player must collect a specific number of points by picking up special icons that appear randomly on the screen. Other pickups may slow down the snake, give bonus points, reverse the controls, or skip the level. There are also enemies moving around the screen, which briefly speed up the snake upon collision. Project X - An arcade game with multiple levels, each with a different style of play. The first level is a side-scrolling shooting sequence, where the player controls a plane. Enemy planes keep flying onto the screen, shooting at the player, and should be avoided or shot down. The second level is a platform game, where the player character uses a grappling hook to move upwards from platform to platform while having to avoid falling rocks, all within a time limit. The third level is a simple arcade sequence where the player character goes right, avoiding rocks dropped by enemies overhead, or ducking under arrows tossed by enemies that occasionally walk onto the screen. The fourth level is a first-person shooting sequence, where the player uses a catapult to launch rocks at enemies. The catapult can be moved left and right, and the target reticle can be moved up and down.
