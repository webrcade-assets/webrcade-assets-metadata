You are the sole guardian of an outpost in a distant part of the galaxy, and you are under attack. Aliens of various sorts are tumbling towards you, and you must rotate and fire your laser beam to destroy them before they hit your base. In addition to the slower tumbling aliens, there is the occasional "superalien" who flies in a flickering helical path before hitting you. A total of 8 hits to your base during a single wave will destroy your base, finishing your game. Successive waves consist of more and faster aliens, until you are eventually overwhelmed. As a last resort, you can use one of the charges of your superzap which will destroy all aliens on the screen. Only one charge is provided per wave, although the number of uses accumulates if they are not used.
