Table Football is a 1â€“2 player sports-themed arcade game for multiple systems. Two players or a computer opponent face off in a game of table football.  Each player controls four lines of players: 1 goalie, 2 defensemen, 3 midfielders, and 3 forwards.  The line closest to the ball is automatically active, and the player can move these men vertically and spin them.  The first player to score nine goals is the winner.
