Iceblox Plus is a new and improved version of the 1996 game Iceblox. It is an action game where you control Pete the pengiun. Your objective is to collect coins which are frozen in some of the available ice blocks. The blocks can be moved until they hit an obstacle, at which point you can destroy them. Flames wander around in the level and can be destroyed by moving a block onto them. Touching flames will cost you one life.
