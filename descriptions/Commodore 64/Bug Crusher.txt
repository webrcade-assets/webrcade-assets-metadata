Bug Crusher is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. The player controls a small spaceship that can move in all directions, and attempts to destroy bugs that appear on the screen by running into them. The player is safe when in the 3 bunkers at the edge of the screen, but when they exit, they are continuously chased by a red enemy who steals the player's limited fuel. Other enemies scroll continuously across the screen, and if the player hits them or runs out of fuel, they lose a life. The player can activate temporary invulnerability at the cost of fuel. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
