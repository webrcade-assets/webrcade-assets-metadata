In this side-view 2D platformer, named after the protagonists, the Dwarf Grell and the Fairy Fella, the objective is to maintain the sorcerer's magic garden which he inherited from an evil witch, whose dark magic still taints the inhabiting insects and flowers. In order to banish evil from the garden you have to use magic spells to cleanse the inhabiting critter or if everything fails, beat them senseless. Also you can grow new plants in the garden for bonus points.
