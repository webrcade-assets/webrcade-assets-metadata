Star Trek 64 is another adaptation of the mainframe game Star Trek. In this version written in BASIC, the player has access to both torpedoes and phasers as weapons. Unlike some versions here it is possible to blow up stars with torpedoes. There are also random events such as space storms that can disable certain systems.
