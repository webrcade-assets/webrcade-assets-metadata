Platou is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the VIC-20. In the space station on Vegatron, men work hard to earn their wages in the mercury mines. To entertain themselves, the miners have created a new game where contestants have to jump between squares wearing an antigravity jumpsuit. The players control a bouncing ball on a field of tiles. The player selects the ball to bounce 1 or 2 tiles at a time in the cardinal directions. Certain colored tiles can temporarily speed up or slow down the ball bounce speed. If the player's ball goes out of the playing field or is hit by the opponent's ball, they lose a life. The goal is to tap all the squares of the player's color, and after tapping enough squares move to the next level.
