Quick Thinking! is a space-themed educational game for children, and consists of two games: Sum-Vaders : a spaceship will appear on the screen with a number inside, and it will drop a robot that also has a number. Add or subtract the two numbers before it lands on the moon's surface. Getting an answer right will result in the robot exploding and the next spaceship to appear. A wrong answer will lock the keyboard until the next problem appears, allowing a robot to land on the surface. The game ends when there are five robots on the surface. The game can be customized before it begins, and this mainly determines how simple or complex the problems are. Robot Machine : a solid circle with a number on it will make its way inside a huge machine, and a multiplication problem consisting of single digits is also displayed. Make a decision whether to accept or reject a block before the light on the machine turns red. Only accept blocks if the right-hand digit belongs in the same times-table as the left-hand digit. Correct answers cause the machine to spit out a good robot onto the rack, and either incorrect answers or taking too much time will cause a bad robot to appear on the rack. The game ends when all ten slots on the rack are occupied. A "Learning Mode" is available, providing players with more examples and a demonstration.
