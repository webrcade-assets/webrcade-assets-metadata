Letterstress is a Dutch spelling educational game, and consists of two games: Word Zepplin - You are in a Zepplin and you have to 'flatten' a letter intertwined in the orange landscape. If this letter occurs in the word that will form at the top left of the screen, you will receive the released projectile back. If the letter is incorrect, you lose the bomb. There will also be an enemy zepplins that you have to avoid. Ladders and Monsters - In this game you have to run through the floors, 'picking up' the letters in the correct order, in order to make a word that will appear on the top left of the screen. If the letter is not the right one, the monsters will come to attack you. These must be dodged. You can change the difficulty of these games in the game options.
