You are Big Nose the Caveman and for reasons unknown you have been transported through time and landed in modern day New York City. You have set up camp beside a zoo but you are appalled that the animals are kept in cages so you have vowed to set them free. In this platform game which scrolls in multiple directions when you move, you must traverse over three levels across the USA in Manhattan, The Wild West and the Golden Gate Bridge to save your animal friends. You must shoot or avoid other people and creatures that roam the level because when touched you lose one of three lives. A joystick or keyboard can be used to control your hero.
