Table Invaders is an educational program that aims to test tables knowledge in the age range of six to eleven, and consists of two games: Tables Tutor - In this game you learn the tables from 2 to 5 through sets of objects, and consists of two parts. Part one is where you have to count objects that appear on the screen (example: How many balls has the clown, counting train carriages, counting window panes). In part two you have to help Eric to park his car by counting the cars in the car park or count the boxes unloaded from the train or you have to count the men that come out of a flying saucer after you shot it down. Table Invaders - This program allows you to practice any table from 2 to 12. The object of the game is to shoot down the rows of invaders that are shuffling down the screen. This can be done by giving the right answer to the times table sum that appears at the bottom. If the math is solved correctly, the player can shoot the invaders before they can land.
