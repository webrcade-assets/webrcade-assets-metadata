Word Flyer is an educational word-matching game for children. Made for 1 - 2 player cooperative play, two birds stand atop a tower of letters on both sides of the screen. Single letters or up to 4-letter words appear on the screen, progressively enlarging and floating towards the player. The goal is to use the joystick to choose the correct word from the tower of letters, and quickly move the text to line it up with the floating words. The player must move quickly, as words will disappear from the screen. The games starts with simple 1-letter matching, but as the player matches words, a grey bar on the bottom of the screen will begin to fill. When the bar fills, the game progresses to a more difficult stage, with a total of 5 stages in total.
