In a different twist for adventures you play a Goblin called Gonj who used to be friends with the Humans but now hides away underground in your home to stop yourself from being killed. Your problem is that your pantry is nearly empty again so you must go up to the surface into the castle above and steal food. This then begins various adventures and quests. Trollbound is a graphic text adventure where you see a picture of your surroundings and text to describe them. You type in commands to control your hero.
