How About A Nice Game of Chess! is a chess playing and teaching program for multiple systems. Allows for 2-player chess play, or 1-player versus the computer with multiple available difficulty levels. Allows for graphical representation of the chess board, and follows standard chess rules. Based upon the same engine as the previously released Chess 7.0 , this version contains educational chess material to help the player improve their chess game. Unique gameplay options include the ability to flip the board, as well as allowing blind play where the rank of different pieces is hidden. The computer can optionally list best moves for players, and games in progress can be saved to disk.
