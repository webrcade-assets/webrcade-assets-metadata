Pipeline is a puzzle game for the Apple II. Water comes from a faucet into a grid-like field. Throughout the field are several items that require water, including: fish, pools, fountains, and washing machines. The player must select from 8 different types of pipe segments, and place them on the grid to make sure water goes to every item on the screen. There are 3 difficulty levels, and players can choose to have each level timed. After the player starts the water, the water is seen advancing through the pipes. Regardless of the player bringing water to all items on the screen, they are brought to a new challenge after this.
