Rescue 17 is an arcade action game in which the player's task, as the commander of Rescue 17, is to get as many wandering astronauts as possible out of their hostile surroundings. To that end, you go on different missions and when you have saved a number of people (depending on the damage you took), you go on the next mission. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids -like way, in that you can turn around and thrust into the direction you want to go. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust. Unlike Astroids, your ship is equipped with no weapons at all.
