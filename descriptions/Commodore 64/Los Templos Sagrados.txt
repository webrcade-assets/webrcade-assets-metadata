Los Templos Sagrados is a Spanish text-adventure, the sequel to La Diosa de Cozumel, and the second "book" of the "Ci-U-Than" trilogy of games. They all utilize the parser DAAD, that has capabilities similar to the Infocom Z-machine one (you can chain commands, correct misspellings, etc). This time around the player searches the ruins of the Yucatán peninsula for the lost mayan temple of Chichén Itzá.
