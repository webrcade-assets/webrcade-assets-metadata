Reversal is a computerized version of Othello. You can play against the computer or another person. If you play against the computer you can choose the difficulty level at which the computer will play (beginner, intermediate or advanced), amount of time the computer will take to decide on its move (from 2.5 seconds to 30 minutes) and color of your pieces. The program switches between text and graphic displays. The Hi-Res graphic display shows the current board, the number of pieces are shown with faces. The cursor can be moved through all the legal positions by using the right and left arrow keys. When you find the position you want, you press the return key which places your piece at this position and flips the appropriate pieces. In case you find the move you just made was unwise, it can be taken back. If you wish, you may continue backing up until a proper position is reached. If you are unsure as to a good move, you can ask the computer for help. The computer will suggest a move. If you would like to see past moves, you can do so by switching to text which shows the past moves instandard chess notation.
