Kubuś Ratuje Królewnę is an adventure game set in the Land of the Dragon. The game world has a size of 40x40 tiles. Part of the half-land is inaccessible, because there are, for example, rocks and walls. Kubuś the Knight is placed on the map in a random place and must reach the imprisoned princess. Each turn, each character moves: the player, the princess - randomly, and the dragon - towards the knight. The player receives information about the adjacent squares and the distance from the princess. The game ends when you reach the princess or encounter the dragon.
