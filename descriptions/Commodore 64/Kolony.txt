Kolony is a turn-based strategy game, putting the player in the position of a governor of a colony on a distant planet. The goal of the game is to accumulate 100 million of currency within 10 years. The game is divided into turns, with each turn representing a single month. Main source of money is excavating and selling natural resources (silicon, iron, uranium, food) to merchant ships which arrive every few turns. In order to excavate a resource, the player must first send expeditions of colonists and scientists until a mine is found. Excavating a resource requires the presence of miner robots, human colonists to direct them, and electricity. Electric power is created by generators, which use up some uranium each turn. Building new structures (warehouses, residences for the staff, factories, landing sites for merchant ships) requires spending resources, and takes some electric power too. Once a factory is constructed, the player can produce machines such as robots and generators, though this requires staff, time and electric power as well. Food is gathered from fields; the more colonists are assigned to the fields, the more food is harvested every six months. New staff can be recruited from arriving merchant ships. The players (if there is more than one) can attack each other, but have to build up an army first, consisting of starfighters, battle robots and soldiers.
