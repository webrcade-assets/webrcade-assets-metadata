Waterline is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Aboard the S. S. Slipshod, things are getting a little out of hand. It seems the navigator mistook an iceberg for Pittsburgh, and tried to pull into port, with predictable results. But, before you get that sinking feeling, take heart. Captain Clutch is in command. The player controls Captain Clutch, who can walk across platforms, climb ladders, and jump off ledges. As the ship sinks, the water levels begin to rise. The player can stoke the boilers to keep the ship afloat longer. If the player spends too much time under water they run out of oxygen and die. Captain Clutch tries to lead the other passengers to the lifeboats at the surface of the ship, and tries to pick up gold bars as he goes. There are 4 levels of difficulty, and it's game over when all passengers are rescued.
