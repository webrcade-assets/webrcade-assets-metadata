Featuring the same concept (complete the same seven tasks) as the other computer versions, this version of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends features a different railroad track design and the game is viewed from a higher camera angle. The Commodore 64 features the occasional different part of a track, but in general keeps the same track design as the CPC and Spectrum versions.
