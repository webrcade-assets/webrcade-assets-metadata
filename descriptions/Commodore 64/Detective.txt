Detective is a 1-6 player strategy game for multiple systems. Played on a 3 x 3 board, players try to solve the murder of Lucky Duke.  At the beginning of the game, each player is given a randomized code from 1 - 9 to express possible culprit, means, and motive for the crime.  The players must hide this information from their opponents.  Each turn the player rolls a dice, and can move up to that number of positions on the board.  The player then must give their code for possible culprit, means, and motive.  The player is also given a clue if they are in the correct location of the murder.  On easy difficulty level the player is informed whether their guesses are correct, while on harder levels the player is informed only the number of their answers that are correct.  Players must be careful not to give hints to their opponents, and they can move their opponents on the board by calling them for questioning.  The first player to correctly guess all 4 aspects of the crime is the winner.
