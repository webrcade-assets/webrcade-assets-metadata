Stickybear Basketbounce is a 1-player children's arcade game. Based upon the Stickybear series of games for children, the player controls Stickybear, who has to collects various objects in a basket as they fall from above and bounce about the stage. Stickybear can move horizontally, but can also jump to collect objects, as well as avoid dangers which move across the floor. Objects will progressively bounce lower, and if the player is hit by an object, they will life a life. Stickybear plays in various factory settings, but also collects objects in space while wearing a spacesuit. The player starts with 3 lives, and gains a life for every stage defeated. The player must collect 10 objects to pass each stage. When a player loses all lives, a bulldozer comes from the right, and pushes Stickybear off the stage.
