The Ormus Saga III: The Final Chapter is a roleplaying game for the Commodore 64. The King of Beryland has once again gone missing, and the creature Azerus of the Ormus Cult has come to power.  The player must defeat the Ormus Cult for a third time. The player moves about an overland 2D scrolling area, and can visit a number of cities and dungeons. Each city is represented by a separate map, where the player can speak to NPCs and shopkeepers.  All commands are by a series of menus at the bottom of the screen. In towns, the player can hire troops, which can assist in combat. As well, towns ore often occupied or attacked by the Ormus Cult, and troops are necessary to defend or liberate cities. These troops can also be equipped with weapons. Monsters appear in the overworld, or can be fought in cities. In combat, the player directly engages on the map, and can cast spells, attack with weapons, or use their troops to attack.
