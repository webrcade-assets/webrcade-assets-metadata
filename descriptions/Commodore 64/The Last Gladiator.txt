The Last Gladiator is an action game where the player becomes a gladiator or a gladiatrix and enters the Colisseum where a number of more or less strange creature have to be fought. Each level starts with the player having to pick up a weapon which is then used to kill the creatures as they enter the arena one at a time. In the first level the player gets a gun which can be aimed and shot with in multiple directions while later levels only offer more difficult to use weapons such as a club, a javelin, a trident and a boomerang. There is also a net which can be used to entangle the enemy. Monsters that have to be fought include spiders, vampires, bats, fire lizards and someone called Mordo the Spaz. While some creatures can be killed with one hit, others such as the snake requires multiple hits.
