Neuronics is a tile-matching puzzle game with similarities to Swap : The player is presented with a number of tiles with different symbols and colours. If two or more identical tiles are next to each other (diagonally does not count), they disappear. To make this happen, the player can swap two adjacent tiles. However, there is a time limit to consider and empty places left behind by removed tiles are not usable. The goal is to clear the whole field. There are four difficulty levels. The first three differ only by a time limit given to complete the stage and awarding with more points when completed. The fourth one brings stages in a random order.
