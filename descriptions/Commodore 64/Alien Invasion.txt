Alien Invasion is a 1 - 4 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a small vessel on the bottom of the screen which moves laterally and fires vertically, and can only fire one shot at a time. Small alien ships approach from above, and move towards the player whenever they fire, but only one alien vessel fires at a time. The player must destroy all enemy vessels to move to the next level, and if they destroy the aliens in a specific order, they gain an extra life. If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.
