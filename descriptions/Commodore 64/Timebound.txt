Timebound is a 1-player educational game for multiple systems Well Doctor, Anacron's done it again. You warned him to stay away from the Time Machine. You warned him of the danger, but did he listen? No! He never listens. Now he's in big trouble - trapped in a time loop - tumbling out of control, between the year 0 and the year 2000! And only you can save him! The player controls the time scanner, which moves in a circle around the oncoming time warp. The player can move forwards or backwards in time between the years 0 and 2000. On the journey they encounters time events. Different positions about the warp have different types of events, which are randomized each game. Each time event tells Anacron's location, and an event from the player's current time. The player tries to reach the time event Anacron is in, but he'll keep slipping to different times as the player chases him. There are 11 levels of difficulty, which determine how long the player has to find Anacron.
