Candy Bandit is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls the bandit, who can move in all directions, while trying to avoid the sheriff. The player tries to navigate between moving walls and collect all the candy on the screen. If the player touches a wall, they can't move until a new gap in the wall appears. If the player collects all the candy, they move onto a more challenging level. The sheriff moves continuously towards the bandit, and if he catches him, the player loses a life. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
