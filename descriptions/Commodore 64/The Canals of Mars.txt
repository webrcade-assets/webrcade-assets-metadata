In the game made with SEUCK (Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit) you control one or two probes (ARAS-91, FL8-RIS) sent in the canals of Mars. During five levels you should explore the hostile environment of the canals, shoot the attacking foes, avoid their attacks and different traps, collect the valuable items, gaining the points. Controlling a probe you may move in four directions, but shoot in one direction only. Two players mode is co-operative and flows onthe same screen.
