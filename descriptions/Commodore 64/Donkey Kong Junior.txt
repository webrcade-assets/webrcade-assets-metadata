This is a remake based on the Atari 7800 version of the classic Donkey Kong Junior arcade game by Nintendo with remade graphics and enhanced sound. In this game the tables have been turned, Donkey Kong Junior must rescue his father from the antagonist Mario, avoiding deadly snap-jaw traps, swooping birds and electric sparks along the way.
