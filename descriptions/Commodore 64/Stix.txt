The main character of this game is Stix, a bundle of energy that roams around the universe destroying everything in its path. Your job is to create force fields that will block its movements, until you have covered at least 75% of the screen. When you complete an outline of the force field by connecting it to the edge of the screen or with other force fields, it fills in with a certain colour, which changes in each level. There are some enemies to watch out for. Apart from Stix, you need to watch out for the spark which moves along the line you awing if you pause for an instant. Also, two primitive particles roam around the edges of the screen and the lines you have drawn. Bump into any of these enemies, or waste too much time in the level, and you lose a life. Lose all your lives and the game is over.
