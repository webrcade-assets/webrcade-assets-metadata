Boppie's Great Word Chase is an educational game for practising spelling and word recognition. The game is a platform game made up of single screen levels where the player controls Boppie, a bouncing ball, who has to collect letters in the correct order so that words are created. One letter can be picked up at a time and then has to be carried to Boppie's house. Meanwhile there are hungry creatures called snappers that have to be avoided. Two devices can be used to get away from the snappers. There is a repeller that can be placed on ladders and stops the snappers from moving past it. There are also umbrellas which allow Boppie to jump down from one platform to another. The game has eight different skill levels that differ in level design, number of snappers, the length of words and how the words appear. The words either remains on the screen throughout the game, they appear briefly and then disappears or they don't appear at all.
