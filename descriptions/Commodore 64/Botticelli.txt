Botticelli is a 1 - 9 player logic learning and guessing game for multiple systems. The computer attempts to guess what object the player is thinking of, or vice versa, by asking a number of yes or no questions. There are multiple categories, and the player must teach the computer a variety of objects by teaching yes or no questions for differing objects. The player can define the number of guesses they have to name an object.
