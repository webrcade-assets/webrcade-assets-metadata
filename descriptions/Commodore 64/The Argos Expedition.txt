The Argos Expedition is a 2 - 4 player strategy game for the Commodore 64. In the early years of interstellar travel, Earth's brave explorers discovered the remains of an alien culture eons old and incredibly complex. Human progress leapt forward at an astonishing rate as the secrets of alien artifacts were brought back from the stars. You have been selected as the most qualified team to write the next chapter in this exciting saga. You have been assigned to the ship's artifact chamber, a position critical for mission success. You will be rewarded with royalty shares for important discoveries, and a salary which can be used to buy tests in the artifact chamber. Each player is assigned a secret goal at the beginning of the mission, which other players are not aware. Success is based upon reaching this goal. The player travels to different locations in space where artifacts are located. During expeditions, the player must monitor life support, temperature, radiation hazards, and finite ship energy. As the ship travels between locations, it may encounter dangers including meteors, gravity warps, space sickness, and wormholes. Meteors must be shot with the onboard lasers using crosshairs. In a gravity warp, the player must position their ship within a series of moving boxes to avoid losing energy. Worm holes involve the player matching tones to survive the singularity. Upon encountering an artifact, the player launces a probe to collect it. They must coordinate a tone and rotation to collect the probe. The player performs tests upon the artifact to determine its value and function. Artifacts can also be burned to increase a ship's energy if not valuable to the player. Artifacts can be returned to mission control for extra credits. There are 3 levels of difficulty and 3 mission lengths.
