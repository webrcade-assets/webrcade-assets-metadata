By the time you've read the name and appreciated the pun, you've already achieved an understanding of half of this game's appeal. From there, little is left to the imagination: two teams on an American football field take turns with possession of a duck (rubber, presumably, given the distances achieved) attempting to kick it (as the author ad-libs, a fowl ball) to the goal line... and victory! In the C64 original you would specify the short or long punt, so as to not drastically overshoot near the goal line and be forced to buy a new duck with a point deduction. Also, sporadically the game would declare that an interception had occurred (or, steady yourselves, an ab- duck -tion). A modern remake has been produced for contemporary operating environments with numerous interface and gameplay enhancements.
