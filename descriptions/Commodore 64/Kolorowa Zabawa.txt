The game consists of two rounds. At the beginning, the player gives the amount of time to make each move. If the player does not make a move within the allotted time, the computer makes 10 random moves that make it difficult to solve the cube. In the first round, the screen is divided into 24 white squares. The computer turns the white squares colored. By changing colors in a row or column, the player must turn all squares white. In the second round, the rules are more complicated by different rules for changing colors on the board.
