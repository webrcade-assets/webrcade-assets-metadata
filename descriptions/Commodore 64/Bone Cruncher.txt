In Bone Cruncher the player takes the role of Bono, a dragon who makes a living by selling soap. His secret of success: he uses skeletons as ingredients. To restock, Bone has to collect more skeletons by traveling through a castle with 22 scrolling levels. This game is a Boulder Dash variant. The levels are filled with dirt (which vanishes when Bono walks over it), monsters, and glooks (basically rocks with eyes). Monsters can only travel on ways without dirt and their touch is hazardous - some even eat up the skeletons. There are 25 skeletons to find in each level and specific steps have to worked out to reach them (e.g. using a glook to cut off a specific monster's path), giving the game a puzzle-solving character.
