Revers! is a translation of the board game Othello/Reversi. Two players (or one player and the computer) take turns placing stones of their color on a 8x8 grid. Stones may only be placed adjacent to others so that two stones of the same color enclose one or more pegs of another color. Enclosed stones change color. The goal is to turn the majority of the board to the player's own color.
