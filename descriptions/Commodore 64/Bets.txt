Bets is a digital representation of the card game Indian Poker. The player plays against three CPU players. Each player holds a playing card above his head and has to place a bet in turn. Each player can see the cards of the other players, but can't see his own card. When the betting stops the player with the highest card wins the pot. Each betting round each player can call, raise or fold. Like with poker players must call a raise or fold and be out of play. The player must win rounds because an ante has to be paid each round.
