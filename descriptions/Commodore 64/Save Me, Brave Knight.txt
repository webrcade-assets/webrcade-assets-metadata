Save Me, Brave Knight is a set of pseudo-3D arcade mini-games taking place in a fantasy medieval world. You play as an armoured and mounted knight whose weapons are thrown spears. Your goal is to enter a castle and rescue a damsel in distress from a seven-headed dragon. There are four stages to the game. In the first, you are outside the castle which is warded by an animated lock, and you must strike the lock three times with a spear to enter. In the second, you are in the courtyard of the castle, and are attacked by flying monsters including witches on broomsticks and large cantankerous birds. Your task is to dispatch the creatures while avoiding their attacks. The third stage is to destroy each of the heads of the seven-headed dragon, while you are under attack from their flaming breath. The final stage asks you to choose between two doors, one of which hides the fair maiden to be rescued. Choosing the correct randomly assigned door then gives you extra points and causes a short musical theme to be played. The game then repeats from stage 1.
