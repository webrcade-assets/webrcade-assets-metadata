Competition Karate is a 1 - 2 player karate simulator and arcade game. The player creates a roster of martial artists who can perform at either white, green, blue, or black belt level. Each character has their own individual statistics, including: strength, agility, quickness, stamina, perception, courage, arms, legs, and body. The player also chooses from a list of five sensei with their own individual strengths. Each character can improve themselves by practicing in the gym, and their sensei influences how the character develops. Characters can be pitted against human or computer controlled opponents in tournament mode or single matches. The player can also have two computer opponents compete to see which characters are the strongest. The player can choose how many rounds are in each match. Combat occurs in turns, where the player selects a direction and action key to direct their martial artist.
