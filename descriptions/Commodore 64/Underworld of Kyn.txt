Underworld of Kyn is a text adventure where the player has been trapped in the underworld by a wizard and has to find a way to leave. Like in other text adventures the player enters simple verb-noun commands to interact with the environment. Common ones include "get" to pick up objects and "examine" to look at objects. Objects that have been collected are stored in an inventory and have to be used at the right location with the right verb to progress. It is possible to combine two commands into one sentence such as "get the torch and then go east". While exploring the underworld the player will come across the wizard at times. If the right command is not entered the wizard will cast a spell and the player is transported to a random location.
