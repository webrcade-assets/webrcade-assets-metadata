Interview is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Dear Applicant: You are requested to attend an interview with "Front Runner" for the position of chief programmer. Please be at our head office within 15 minutes. Gameplay is divided into 2 arcade sequences. In the first section the player must reach the bank to withdraw money to purchase a suit. During this sequence the player walks along a sidewalk, and moves left and right, accelerates, or decelerates, to avoid manhole covers, banana peels, dogs crossing the road, trash cans, and falling flower pots. Every obstacle they hit costs the interviewee time. After reaching the bank, gameplay enters an overhead perspective in a large scrolling city map. The player must find their way to the tailor to buy a suit, the cleaners to get it cleaned, and finally arrive at the interview at the office. The player must avoid cars, dogs, other pedestrians, and open sewers. Every obstacle hit costs time. If the player reaches the interview within 15 minutes clean and presentable they get the job.
