In this game, you're a clown on an unicycle who has to pop balloons that are falling down from the sky. This can be done by moving left and right to catch them all on your head. Further on, you have to form columns instead of popping them. These columns have a nasty habit of getting each time higher, giving you less time to react. However, if you're close enough to the balloon you can kick the balloon and try again. Another way is to catch the 'Pac-Man' that comes down between the balloons. This will eat the balloons that fall on your head. If you miss, you'll fall from your unicycle.
