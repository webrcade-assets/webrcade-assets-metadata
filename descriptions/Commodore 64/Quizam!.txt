Quizam! is a 1 - 8 player trivia game for multiple systems. Eight mysterious dark satellites orbiting the Earth must be destroyed. Their onboard computers have malfunctioned, generating an enormous volume of questions that are strange, cryptic- even trivial! Knowledge must be combined with careful strategy if you are to gain access to the satellites and succeed in this mission! Players move about the board, trying to gather the eight satellites present on the screen. At the beginning of each turn, the player tries to correctly answer a 4-question multiple-choice question. The player receives movement points based upon how quickly they answer questions. The player must have the correct number of movement points to end their turn directly on top of the satellite. There are 8 different board layouts, 8 different difficulty levels, and games can be short or long.
