Hareraiser: Prelude is the first part in a puzzle game for multiple systems. The player moves through a forest using the direction buttons following a hare.  Each screen has different positions of trees, rocks, and the sun.  As they follow the hare, they receive clues that are supposed to help them find the real life hidden treasure of a golden hare, which was supposedly hidden somewhere in England.
