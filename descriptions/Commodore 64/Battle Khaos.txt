Battle Khaos is a strategic wargame for up to 4 players, based on Julian Gollop's "Chaos - the battle of wizards". The game allows to choose the number of players, sides of the conflict and the type of alliance. It is possible to play alone against other players or create alliances. The gameplay itself is turn-based, divided into spell choice and move phase. The only wizard or alliance left on the board wins the game.
