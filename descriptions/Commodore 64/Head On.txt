Head On is a one player arcade racing game featuring two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a circular track with 6 lanes. The goal is to collect as many pellets as possible without coming in contact with the opponent vehicle. The opponent vehicle will always try to change lanes towards the player, and can move one lane per opening. The player can change two lanes per opening, and must outmaneuver their opponent. Because shorter inside lanes take less time to traverse, the time between two vehicles passing remains variable. There are 9 levels of difficulty, which influence the opponent's speed. The player starts with 5 vehicles. It's game over when all are destroyed.
