Tink!Tonk!: Tink's Adventure is a series of educational minigames designed to teach letter order. Tink decides to go on an adventure. He can either take a boat or a helicopter out on Tinktonk Lake, where he encounters a large island, and is eventually forced to land. There, he meets a giant gorilla who throws coconuts at Tink. Finally, he comes across The Great Gork guarding a treasure. With Gork defeated, Tink once again returns home. Along the way, Tink can play various word games: Get Gas: Fill in the missing first or last letter of 5 letters in alphabetical order. Go Fishing: Quickly type a string of random letters before they scroll off the screen. Fish length and word speed is customizable. Coconut Catch: Type the missing letter in the center of a 3 letter string before the coconut hits the ground. Sinking Boat: Fill in the blank of the pattern before the boat sinks. Gork's Treasure: Fill in missing letters for word order or keyboard patterns and make The Great Gork disappear
