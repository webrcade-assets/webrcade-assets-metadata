Logic Builders is a 1-player game for multiple systems. The player creates and copies pictures using a set number of geometric shapes. The player utilizes spiders to place their pieces, and the goal is to duplicate the displayed image. There are 3 levels of picture difficulty, and 3 levels of spider difficulty. On higher spider difficulty, the spiders will place multiple pieces at once, making it harder to create a precise image. Pieces can be overlaid to make new shapes. The player gains promotions with successful designs.
