No Mercy is a military themed crosshair shooting game, very similar to Operation Wolf. Players shoot their way through levels by moving the crosshair across the screen and firing. Pressing space shoots rockets. There are seven levels in total, starting in a desert camp, then by the river side, jungle plains, an airport, a prison yard, train yards and finally the escape helicopter. The levels are left-to-right scrolling screens, except the third and final level that are stationary. Enemies include foot soldiers, soldiers with bazookas, helicopters, tanks, boats, gunships and jet skis. Players have limited health and ammo, and a maximum of three rockets. Bonus items scattered thoughout the levels can be shot to replenish ammo, rockets or health. Most likely the game was not available separately and only through the Golden Disk 64 magazine.
