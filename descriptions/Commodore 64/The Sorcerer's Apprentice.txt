The Sorcerer's Apprentice is an arcade game and text adventure for the Commodore 64. Once upon a time, many years ago before YOP schemes were invented and the Manpower Services Commission was but a wrinkle in a civil servant's eye, young lads were apprenticed to masters. Now, this is your once-in-a-lifetime chance to become apprenticed to a sorcerer, Unfortunately, the sorcerer has whisked himself away on holiday leaving you in charge of the practice. At first, all goes well but then the mischievous brooms decided to flood your reservoir. In the arcade component, two brooms carry buckets of water from the left side of the screen to the right. The sorcerer must try to run into them, preventing them from reaching the right of the screen, where the brooms pour their water into the reservoir. Whenever a broom reaches the right, the water level rises. If a broom is intercepted, it immediately rushes back to the left of the screen to pick up more water. At the same time other creatures try to steal bricks from the reservoir, making it require less water to cause a flood. The player is armed with a magic wand which can be used up to 3 times per game to temporarily freeze the brooms. The goal is to prevent enough brooms from reaching their goal to reach skill level 2, to acquire a passcode for the text adventure. The second component of the game is a text adventure. The player must travel through the Wizard's Kingdom to find the Throne of Knowledge. There are a total of 74 rooms to explore, and the player can hold up to 10 items at a time. They are also armed with a spell book, but only one spell can be held at a time. A variety of dangers and puzzles must be overcome in the castle. All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.
