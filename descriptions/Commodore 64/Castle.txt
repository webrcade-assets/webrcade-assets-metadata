In this platformer your aim is to find all 13 bottles that contain ingredients to a magic spice. You control a mechanoid and you will explore over one hundred of locations of a castle. The castle is divided into three sections: outside, inside and underground (dungeons). At one time you may carry up to three items. Apart from the above mentioned bottles that you have to bring back to one of the four buyer's places, you may find potions of health restoration and keys to open locked doors. Some locations can be accessible only using teleporters. At the bottom of the screen you can see the energy bar and your ingame progress represented by number of the bottles you still have to collect.
