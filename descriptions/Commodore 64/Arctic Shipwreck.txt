A ship has sunk, and the survivors have become stranded on an unstable chunk of arctic ice. The effect of the weight of the people and the howling arctic wind may capsize the iceberg at any minute, or at least cause the survivors to slide into the ocean. You play as a large mammoth, and your goal is to save these people by shifting your weight about to counter-act the weight imbalances of the iceberg. If you can manage to keep some of the fragile humans alive until the rescue ship arrives, then you complete the level and are ready to start the next. On each level, points are gained at regular time intervals just by surviving. A bonus is awarded when the rescue ship, which is slowly making its way from right to left at the top of the screen, eventually arrives. The bonus score is awarded for each rescued survivor. So you will get a lower score if people have been tipped into the sea, or carried away by ravenous sea birds. The birds can be discouraged if you chase them away, but that may cause the ice to tip out of control, leading to disaster. If everyone dies before the boat arrives, then you lose a life and have to re-start the level. Also, humans may not be the only victims of the unstable ice. If you fall into the water yourself, then it is also game over.
