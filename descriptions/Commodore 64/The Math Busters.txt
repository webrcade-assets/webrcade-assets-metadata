The Math Busters is an educational math game. The player controls a man who can jump, run, and swim, who attempts to destroy various math monsters hiding within a cave. Each monster is represented by a number, and if the player collects a mathematical equation equal to the number, they can destroy the monster within the cave, causing more to appear. A dog runs around outside the cave, which can trip up the player. Each symbol is found outside the cave, and can be used only once. A machine on the far left of the play area can replenish numbers as well as eliminate unused letters the player may have collected.
