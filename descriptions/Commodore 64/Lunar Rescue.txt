Lunar Rescue is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Your mission is to rescue the stranded scientists on the lunar surface and return them to the orbital station. The orbital station moves slowly across the top of the screen, and the player must choose the correct time to release their landing module to try to sneak through a field of horizontally moving asteroids and land on one of the flat landing pads below. The player has limited fuel which can be used to slow their descent. This fuel is used throughout all missions. After loading a scientist, the player tries to return to the the orbital station. At this time the asteroids become enemy ships that fire towards the player. The player has the chance to return fire, and must reach the opening at the orbital station. This sequence repeats until all scientists are rescued or the player loses 5 ships.
