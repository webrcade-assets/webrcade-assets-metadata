Police Cadet is a arcade shooting game for the Commodore 64. The player takes on the role of a police cadet training to become an officer. On the screen, numerous people run back and forth between doors at what appears to be a busy subway station. The player controls cross-hairs, and must quickly shoot any criminals wielding a gun before they disappear into another doorway. The player must take care to avoid shooting innocents. On the bottom of the screen, a police scanner tracks recent criminal events, and the time remaining in the training session. At the end of each session, the player receives a score based upon criminals and innocents shot.
