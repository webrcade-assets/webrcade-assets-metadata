Golden Axe is an arcade beat-'em-up game that puts players in the shoes of one of three heroes, each with their own reason for trying to overthrow the evil rule of Death-Adder, who - along with his forces of darkness - kidnapped and imprisoned the King and his daughter and stole the legendary Golden Axe. This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety of this creature that drops food that replenishes your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion-like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it. The original arcade game and most conversions allow players to play up to two characters at once, however in the Sega Master System and C64 versions, this option has not been implemented. The Sega Master System version only has one playable character. Tarik, a close relative to Ax Battler the original barbarian, retelling the story from his perspective. The C64 version allowing only one player at a time, was also limited in other areas, such as fewer levels, only one enemy can engage the player at a time and there are only two types of dragons instead of three.
