IJK's Chess is a classic chess boardgame adaptation: You play white side against black side (or reverse), capturing pieces when coming on their square, and try to Check-Mate the adverse King.By default you play white and the computer plays black, but in the 'set level' menu you can chose which side would be played by human or computer, you can even let the computer fight against itself, you can set the level (from 1-8) which is the number of half-moves anticipated by computer (and 3 sublevels for advanced configuration: sublevels, care and speed), you can modify the time allowed between each move (60 hours by default). You can also edit the board (setting pieces in custom positions) to solve chess problems, and you can also edit the colors used for pieces and squares.To control your moves you can use co-ordinate moves (entering A2-A4 to move the queen tower pawn 2 squares ahead) or use the cursor to select a piece and then its destination.Don't try to cheat, any illegal move would be refused.
