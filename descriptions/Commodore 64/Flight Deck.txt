Flight Deck is a simulation game in which the player commands a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the HMS Indispensable. It has been sent to a Pacific island where nuclear terrorists, the Black Army Dissidents, are hiding. They threaten the world with a nuclear bomb. The mission is to map the island, discover the terrorist base and destroy it. The game is played on three screens: 1) The Aircraft Carrier (F1): The deck of The Indispensable occupies the top half of the screen, complete with take off and landing runways, aircraft lifts, parking bays, and tractor. At the bottom of the screen are the instruments (wind speed and direction, course, crosswind, weather and damage status) and the number of aircraft still owned. There are ten bays containing four fighters (blue), four reconnaissance planes (purple) and two bombers (green). The bay is shown in red until a plane has been refuelled and ready for take off. Here the player must control the take off and landing of the planes. 2) The Map Screen "F2" (Commodore "F3"): It gives a long range view of the area around the carrier. This screen also gives the position and fuel status of airborne aircraft. 3) The Island Screen "F3" (Commodore "F5"): The island can now be seen enlarged on the screen. In order to find the terrorist base fly a reconnaissance plane over the island photographing the land. If the player manages to photograph the entire island, the position of the enemy base will be revealed (a target will appear on the island). Now fly a bomber to the island and bomb the base. Fighter planes can defend bombers or reconnaissance planes. There's a time limit of 12 hours to complete the mission. If the terrorist base is not successfully destroyed at the end of these twelve hours, the terrorists will activate their nuclear missile and destroy New York. It also ends when the carrier or all bombers are destroyed. The speech will give important information during the game and will comment on the present status.
