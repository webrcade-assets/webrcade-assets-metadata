The Incredible Laboratory is a 1 - 2 player educational game for multiple systems. You are a scientist, whom must discover which chemical component is used to make each of the 5 components of a monster. These are the head, body, arms, legs, and feet. There are 3 progressively more difficult levels of novice, apprentice, and scientist. On higher difficulty levels, different component mixed in different orders will ultimately make different monsters. The player must learn to predict which component combinations will make specific traits, and 2 players can develop formulas, and must choose what they think the monster will appear as.
