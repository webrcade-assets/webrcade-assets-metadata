Space Ric-O-Shay is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. You are approaching your galactic outpost on Sigma-Beta 7 when you spot an Alderon Mother Ship in orbit just above the "L2" settlement. Since Alderons are wanted for planet piracy, you arm yourself and attack. But as the mothership explodes, four pods escape. The player controls a small ship at the bottom of the screen that moves laterally, and fires vertically forwards. A large alien vessel appears on the screen, and moves horizontally from left to right. It moves down one row each time crossing the screen, and fires at the player. When it is hit, it bursts into 4 segments that bounce wildly around the screen, while a new larger alien ship appears. The ship fragments can be shot, and when destroyed, create bumpers, that can bounce future bouncing space fragments. If the player is hit by a large ship or a bouncing fragment, they lose a life. Five lives, and it's game over.
