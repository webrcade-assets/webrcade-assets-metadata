Pakacuda is a Pac-Man variant. The difference from other games of its kind is that it features an underwater theme. The player is the titular pakacuda fish and has to make their way through the maze and eat all the smaller fish they comes across. The pakacuda is not only a predator but a prey too. They have to avoid the octopuses that chase them around the maze. If they come into contact with an octopus they will lose one life. To protect themself the player has to eat eels that provide them with a charge enough to take on the octopuses. Charges only last a limited time though and once it's over the defeated octopuses will reappear.
