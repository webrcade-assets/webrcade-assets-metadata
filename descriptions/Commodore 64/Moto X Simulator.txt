Five skill sections and four time trials await you and your dirt bike in this top-down action game. The hazards include boulders in the road, trees in the forests, gaps to jump and uphill slopes. Rocks and logs can be cleared with a simple jump action. If you donâ€™t land on the back wheels, you could fall off. Climbing ramps involves carefully judging the angle, and adjusting your bike to match. You start off with 3 lives, and get an extra one after each of the 9 levels.
