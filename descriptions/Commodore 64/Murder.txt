One evening a body is found in the Rambling Hall. This is the country home of the senior member of the Cabinet, Third Lord Rambling. You, Chief Inspector Pincher of the Yard has been called to the scene of the murder and it seems that one of the guests in the house is a murderer. The object of the game is to interview all suspects until you can establish who has done it through the process of elimination. You have a time limit to discover who the culprit is. It must be done before midnight or the murderer, who is stalking you, will get you. Murder! is a game inspired by the board game Clue. At the start of the game, you know the name of the victim, the murder weapon, the location of the crime, the time the body was found, who found it and the time of death. There are seven suspects and eight murder weapons. You can interview anybody about the murder as long as they are in the same room. To move from room to room you must press "GO TO" and then you need to enter the name of the room you wish to visit. If you want to start the interview with a suspect you must press "ENTER‚Äù and then enter the name of the person you wish to talk to. Your interviewee will stay with you until you start talking to somebody else or leave the room. There are four types of questions you may ask the suspects by using keys 1 to 4: Key 1.
