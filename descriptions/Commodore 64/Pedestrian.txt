Pedestrian is a 1-player arcade game. The player controls a small man who moves in the cardinal directions, and tries to cross a busy road and river. Vehicles, snakes, and large mutant creatures move horizontally across the screen, and the player must move between these dangers. While crossing the river, the player must use logs and lily pads to cross, while avoiding alligators and lily pads that sink below the water. The player has 60 seconds to reach 1 of 4 goals at the top of the screen. After filling all 4 slots, the player advances to a more difficult level.
