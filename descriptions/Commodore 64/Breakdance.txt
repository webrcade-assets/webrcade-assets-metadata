Breakdance is game based on the dance craze from the early 80s and consists of three different games, a chance to compete in the three games together or just choreograph your own dance routine. One or two players can play with each player taking it turns to dance. The games you can play are: Hot Feet Dance Contest: This is a Simon -like simple break dancing memory game. A computer character performs a pattern of five break dancing moves which the player then has to reproduce by moving his joystick in one of four directions. Every round, one more move is added, increasing the difficulty the player continues. Battle the Rocket Crew: You are near a river and rows of dancers slowly dance down the screen and to make a dancer disappear you have to copy their moves. You need to keep making the dancers disappear or they will keep pushing you towards the river and it is game over when you fall into the water. Perfections Dance Puzzle: You watch a dancer perform four moves before the four moves appear above you in the wrong order. You have to put the moves shown, in the right order to win ghettoblasters. You have the option called Grand Loop and this allows you to play all three games to try to enter the Breakdance Hall of Fame. The choreograph option allows you to perform in front of a crowd and choose from 14 moves to keep them entertained.
