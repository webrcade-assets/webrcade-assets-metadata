Seawar is a two-player game in which the players try to destroy their opponent who is piloting a submarine or an aeroplane without damaging the neutral ships. Both vehicles move constantly from left to right or right to left. They can also move up, down or change speed. The submarine can hit its opponent with missiles and the plane can drop bombs. Whoever hits his opponent scores one point. If instead one of the ships crossing the sea is hit, the opponent gets a point. Whoever scores 20 first wins.
