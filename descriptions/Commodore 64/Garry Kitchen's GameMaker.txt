Garry Kitchen's Gamemaker allowed the user to develop games using a joystick-driven, menu-based editor consisting of five tools: SpriteMaker, SoundMaker, MusicMaker, SceneMaker, and the Editor. Published by Activision in 1985 and released for the major computing platforms of that era, including the Commodore 64, Apple ][ and IBM PC, Gamemaker including several complete games (Pitfall! and Megamania) along with demos, sprites, music, sound effects and scenes. Add-on disks for Sports and Science Fiction were available for the C64 version, which included various elements to utilize with those themes.
