This was a free game included in the April 1986 edition of the German Commodore 64 magazine called 64'er.  It's a text adventure with graphics based on the comic book Astérix and the Black Gold.  Panoramix has had a stroke when learning he has run out of rock oil which is an important ingredient in potions.  Astérix, Obélix, Idéfix, and the druid Zérozérosix (who turns out is a Roman spy) all go to the Middle East to find some more rock oil.  Journey across the sea and then to Jerusalem and Babylon to find it.  The story's graphics are simple and you need to enter the correct text commands to successfully progress.
