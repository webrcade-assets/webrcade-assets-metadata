You are an avid adventure game player but things are starting to get boring and stale and you really would love to do something different. At the Birmingham Adventure Players Society you discuss this with your friend Lizzie and have decided that a REAL adventure is what the doctor ordered. Lizzie has agreed this is a great idea and has found the perfect location for your new adventure. Her aunt owns an old house outside Birmingham and is away for a couple of weeks on holiday so Lizzie has now dared you to get to the house next week and try to complete her adventure. Starting in your home a week later, you have received no address of the house, just a clue and so the start of a different kind of adventure for yourself. I Dare You is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands withe the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
