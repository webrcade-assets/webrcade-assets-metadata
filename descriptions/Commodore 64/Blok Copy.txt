Blok Copy is a puzzle game. The player is at presented with a 5x7 board consisting of different kinds of tiles. At the start each column has only one kind of tile but the tiles will then get shuffled around. The aim of the game is then to restore the board as it was at the start. The player uses the keyboard to move the rows and columns until the board has been restored. Once completed another board will be unlocked. There are ten in total. The time is limited so the player can't take too long.
