SuperTed: The Search for Spotty is an action game based on the Welsh superhero animated television series SuperTed about an anthropomorphic teddy bear with superpowers. SuperTed's best friend Spotty has been kidnapped by Texas Pete and his henchmen Bulk and Skeleton. SuperTed is controlled in a side-scrolling environment and can fly. Enemies can be punched to take them out. About a third at the bottom is taken up by an interface where SuperTed is shown, along with the current score and the number of lives left. After defeating Skeleton in the first level, SuperTed is taken into space for the second one. When Texas Pete is defeated at the end of the second level, the game is over. The game can be played in two versions: an easy one for younger players and a harder one for the more experienced.
