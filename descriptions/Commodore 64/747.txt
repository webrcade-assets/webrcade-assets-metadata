747 is a flight simulator allowing yourself to fly a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet at various airports including Newcastle, Gatwick and Amsterdam. When the game starts you are flying towards the words DR SOFT. This allows you to get used to the steering and other controls. From this screen you can then select which airport and scenario you want to fly. Options include Taking-Off and Landing. Hoops may also be flown through while trying to land. The game is played with the screen split into two halves. The top half is your view from the front of the plane while the bottom half shows the instrument panel. Control is played via the Joystick and Keyboard.
