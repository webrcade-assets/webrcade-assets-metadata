You are a good patriot and the old king needs your help. His sword has been missing for some time. And it is precisely the magical powers of that sword that have always saved the land from disaster. Your quest takes you through the four provinces of the kingdom: Bosland, Kaalland, Lalland and Iceland. The king is destitute, and can give you little more than his seal. Het Zwaard van de Koning is a Dutch interactive fiction (with graphics) where you input all actions via verb-noun commands with the keyboard to interact with the surroundings, such as 'OPEN DOOR' (OPEN DOOR). To navigate your way through the locations in the game you use 'N(OORD)', 'Z(UID)', 'O(OST)', 'W(EST)'. When you type '?' and it will repeat the description of the location you are in. If you want to know what your possessions are you need to type 'BAGAGE'. "STOP" brings up a menu where you can choose to end the game, save the situation to tape or continue playing.
