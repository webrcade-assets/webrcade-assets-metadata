Frogmaster is a soccer game for one to four players. The players control tadpoles on the pitch, which react to joystick input which act as rewards. The player must train the tadpoles to score goals by reaching the other side of the pitch. Added challenge is generated by walls on the pitch and evolving tadpoles into frogs which can lay eggs and eat other tadpoles. In the original Mainframe version there were only frogs.
