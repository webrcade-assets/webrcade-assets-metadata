With various types of forces and units you give orders to them in your quest for Western European domination. The computer plays as the Europeans but the game is played in real-time and not the usual taking it in turns to place orders before the computer works out the outcome of each turn. A country will only surrender when all it's cities have fallen and the end of the game is when you have accumulated 100000 victory points, which means you can win if England falls but not France. The game is viewed showing a map of Western Europe and icons show cities, armies and terrain. The game is based on Len Deighton's history book Blitzkrieg: From the Rise of Hitler to the Fall of Dunkirk,
