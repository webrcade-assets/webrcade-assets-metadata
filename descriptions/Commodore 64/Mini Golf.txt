Mini Golf, as the name implies, is an 18 hole game of miniature golf that you play on the computer. The holes have the various enhancements you would expect on a good miniature golf course, including loops, waterfalls, warp holes, electric barriers, spinning triangles and discs, whirlpools etc. In the arcade version, you need to earn additional holes through good play on the previous holes. In the home version it's more about challenging yourself and others to attain the lowest possible score.
