Foto Fitter is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player character runs horizontally, and can jump as well as use his tie to attack. The goal is to run from one side to the other of a side-scrolling level, while avoiding enemies including cars, camels, and construction equipment. A map in the bottom right shows the player's progression on the level. Each time the player crosses the level, they receive 1/6th of a picture of a person, and after completing the picture, they go to the next of 4 levels with different geography and animals. The player has limited health which is restored each level. If the player loses all health, it's game over.
