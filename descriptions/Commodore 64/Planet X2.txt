Planet X2 was recently discovered and deemed to be inhabitable by humans, but the Protoids have also laid claim to the planet.  Planet-X2 is a real-time strategy game, which involves mining for resources, constructing new buildings, and defending your base.  You will need to scout around the map to find the enemy bases and destroy them using either tanks or nuclear missiles.
