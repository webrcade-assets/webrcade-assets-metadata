Smurk is a text-based adventure game for multiple systems. The player starts in a small tent in the woods, armed with only a lamp. Their goal gather all the treasure hidden within a cave to the east, and return them to the tent. Inhabiting the cave is the Smurk, a fearsome creature which is nearly invisible, and can kill the player by merely pointing at them. The player must also try to kill the Smurk during their adventures. The player must explore the caverns, and solve a number of inventory based puzzles to reach all the treasures contained within. Each treasure successfully returned places the player closer to their goal of 1000 points. The player inputs all actions via VERB NOUN commands, and the player can save or restore a game in progress.
