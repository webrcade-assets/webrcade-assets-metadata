Payday is a 2 - 4 player board game based upon the original 1975 board game by Parker Brothers. Players take turns moving on a board shaped like a calendar of the days of the month. The goal is to have the most amount of money at the end of the game. Each person starts with $325, and players take turns rolling a single die, and move the corresponding number of positions on the board. The player chooses the number of months they wish to play each game, from 1 - 12 months. Different spaces include bills, the option to buy insurance, collect inheritance, and receive payday. At the end of each month, the player must pay their bills, and if the player's bills outweigh their payday, the player will have to take out a loan at the end of the month. There is a 20% interest each month on outstanding loans. The player can also start a savings account, where they will receive a 10% interest at the end of each month. There are special deal cards, where the player can buy unique items, and if they can find a buyer for the item, they receive a profit on the sale. Sundays are always rest days.
