Word Spinner is an educational game about pattern recognition and English language skills. The game features a "game show" feel to it, as the word spinner itself resembles a simple Wheel of Fortune and "prizes" are won during the course of the game. The goal is to form new words from the "clue" given. This clue can be blank spaces (e.g. form a three letter word) or include already assigned letters (e.g. form a three letter word, that starts with "t"). The goal is find 6 different words for each level, which will fill up the "word spinner", which represents a simple spinning wheel. Points are assigned for successful words, and every 300 points, the player is allowed to go to the prize spinner to select their winnings. Difficulty can be assigned between three and four letter words, and with different letters already embedded inside the word for the player to work with. Players are given the option of printing out the words they have found on the Word Spinner.
