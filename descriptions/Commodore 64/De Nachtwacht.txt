De Nachtwacht is a Dutch graphic text adventure in which once again the well-known Chip Nibbel, the most fanatical MCN member, plays the leading role. He is now working for the first time as a night watchman at the MCN warehouse. Chip Nibbel's task is to catch different crooks who want to rob the magazine's main offices within 100 turns. To navigate your way through the locations in the game you use 'n(oord)', 'z(uid)', 'o(ost)', 'w(est)'. When you type 'K(IJK)' (LOOK) you get a full description of your location. Type 'v(oorwerp)' (items) to know the visible items that are in your location. 'r(ichting)' (direction) will give you information about possible exits. However, if you want to know what the visible items are in your location, possible exits and description of your location you need to type "ALLES". If you want to know what you have in your possession you need to type 'B(EZIT)' (POSSESSION). With 'KIJK' (LOOK) + noun you can look at an object that is at your location or in your possession. This was a contest for the MCN computer magazine. The player who could solve the problem within the least amount of steps could win a year subscription. There is also the chance to win one of the 3 big prizes: vouchers of 1500,- 1000, - and 500 guilders to spend on MCN articles. This is by answering the three questions correctly at the end of the game. And then use the solution to compose a slogan for MCN. Put this on the coupon that comes with this game and send it to MCN.
