Klartz and the Dark Forces is a text adventure for multiple systems. The date is 1236T, one thousand two hundred and thirty six years since the rise of Klartz, Lord of All Darkness.  Little remains from the time before, except for a few isolated human colonies scattered across the galaxy. Klartz now prowls the vast empty reaches of space, sliding through the barriers of time toward unsuspecting eras of the past, setting up some great calamity or hideous act of destruction in each. The player is a member of a small group of survivors dedicated to The Plan, to rid the universe of  Klartz and his dark forces.  The power of Klartz can only be broken in one way: by gathering the relics of his many victims through time and space together in a place unsullied by Klartz's dark forces.  These relics will radiate sufficient brilliance to counter and eliminate the Lord of All Darkness. The player has finally constructed a one-man time capsule, and the adventure has begun. All commands are via VERB NOUN entry.  There is a save/restore feature.
