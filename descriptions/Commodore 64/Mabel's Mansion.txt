Barney the Bellhop just heard the unfortunate news that his aunt Mabel has passed.  To balance this, it seems Mabel has left her considerable fortune to Barney as an inheritance.  Mabel has hidden her treasures throughout her 90 room mansion, and has created a series of traps and puzzles that Barney must solve to prove himself worthy of her fortune.  His aunt furthermore has summoned various monsters from the netherworld in order to guard the mansion and thwart Barney's progression.  Mabel's ghost continues to haunt the largest cache, and she must be evaded for Barney to claim his reward. The player must thoroughly explore the mansion, as keys have been cleverly hidden throughout the house.  Various pieces of furniture must be pushed or manipulated, which will trigger events in other rooms.  Weapons can be found hanging on the walls, and these can be used to vanquish the denizens of Mabel's domain.  Each weapon is only effective against one monster.    Barney can also jump, enter doors, and climb up and down staircases.  The player starts with 15 health points, but loses points whenever they are injured.  0 points, and it's game over.   To win the game, Barney must defeat all the monsters and collect every treasure in the mansion.
