Anonimus is a graphical text adventure in Dutch where the player is looking for the riches of the very aggressive dwarf Ghnomus. The objective of the game is to gather twenty keys while facing many dangers such as electric walls, lasers, spring blocks, conveyor belts, drop doors, crocodiles and scorpions. The game is a mix of an adventure and platform game, where instead of using a joystick, you have to enter text commands to move your character. Movement to the left and right can be done with typing 'links' ( left) or 'rechts' ( right). If you want to climb up the ladders you need to type 'klim' and if you want to go down again, type 'daal' ( descend). With 'klim links' ( climb left) or 'klim rechts' ( climb right) you can walk up the stairs and 'daal links' ( descend left) or 'daal rechts' ( descend right) if you want to go down the stairs. To go through narrow corridors, you have to type 'kruip(en)' ( crawl), followed by a direction like 'links' ( left) or 'rechts' ( right). Type 'staan' if you want to stand up again. If you cannot reach a rope then you need to type first "spring" ( jump) and then 'klim' ( climb). There are also places where you have to jump over things, so you need to type "spring" followed by a direction like 'links' ( left) or 'rechts' ( right).When you are in reach of one of the keys, you can type 'pak sleutel' ( take key).
