Radius is a horizontally scrolling arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a space ship that moves in all directions and fires rapidly to the right approximately 2/3 of the way across the screen. Enemy ships rapidly approach from the right of the screen, and they must be shot down or avoided. After travelling for about a minute, the player completes the section and enters a new level with similar enemies but a different background. Enemies include large rockets, and enemies that attack as spirals or swarms.
