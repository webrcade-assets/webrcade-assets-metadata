Pluff is a platform game, where the player must search for the coin of power in order to leave the maze. The main character has to go around the place and collect various objects. Three items can be carried simultaneously. Pluff will meet many unfriendly creatures and unpleasant surprises, but he will also find keys for opening doors, wires for making traps and other useful items. Pluff is weaponless, therefore the only way to avoid enemies is proper use of jumping skill. The player has to collect a sufficient number of weights, that after placing them in spots marked with arrows, will rise up a stone giving access to the remaining part of the maze, concealing the coin of power.
