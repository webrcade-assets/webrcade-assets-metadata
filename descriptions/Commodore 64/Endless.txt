"Eindeloos" once was a popular tourist attraction. People from all over the world came to see the subterranean wonders of the huge cave system. But this came to an end when an alien super-being was awakened by an exploration on one of Neptune's moons. Angrily, the super-being directed his eyes to Earth and took up residence in "Eindeloos" and turned it into a fortress. The super-being then took a form of a mystic heart and went back to slumber. The player now has to descend with a helicopter in "Eindeloos" to defeat the super-being and its hordes. The player has control over a helicopter in a multidirectional perspective. While the player is exploring the immense caves, it is very important not to be hit by the many moving obstacles such as mines, scroll tracks and energy wires. Also the enemies, who resemble winking skulls (and can take different forms) will attack the player. Fortunately, they can be destroyed with the fire button of your joystick or you can lure them so that they fly up against the obstacles. To continue, the player can change the direction of the funnels and doors by pressing on levers and arrows with the space bar. If you use the spacebar on an exclamation mark, you can continue from the exclamation mark after a crash. The player starts the game with 14 helicopters.
