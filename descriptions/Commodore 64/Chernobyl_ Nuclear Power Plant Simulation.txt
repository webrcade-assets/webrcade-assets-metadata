Chernobyl: Nuclear Power Plant Simulation is a simulation of a nuclear power plant. The player takes control of the Chernobyl plant before the 1986 catastrophe, but this has no influence on the game, aside from the title of the game. Gameplay consists of looking at menus, analyzing numbers and entering commands through a parser, e.g. disabling generators or closing exhaust valves, to influence said numbers. The goal is to have a smooth power generation and, if something goes wrong, to follow the emergency guide given in the manual.
