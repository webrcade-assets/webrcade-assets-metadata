Cohen's Towers is a side-scrolling action game. You play as Allen, the nephew of the nameless boss of a large corporation. You've been hired by your uncle for a summer job as a mail boy. As the mail boy, you need to pick up all the boxes of mail within an individual tower, and bring them individually to one of three mail boxes within the tower. While trying to collect all the mail, beware of the boss' dog Fear, Bobby the Corporate Spy, and dangerous falling flower pots. Don't forget to kiss the secretary for bonus points. Every time you die, you'll lose a demerit. Four demerits and it's game over. You'll start work in tower Fanda. If you clear out that level, you'll be promoted to work in tower Datamost. Finally, with perseverance, you might be promoted to Cohen's Tower.
