Monkeybuilder is an educational game for children aged 6â€“12 designed to teach children how to read and sound out words. Students help Marc the Monkey catch word parts in his net and take them over to the platform.  When word parts are properly combined, Marc will scamper up the tree and hoist the word up to become part of the house.  There are 17 levels of challenge, which include: reinforcing phonics, word attack skills, spelling, pronunciation, word analysis, and vocabulary building.
