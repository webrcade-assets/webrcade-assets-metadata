The owner of Bastow manor is rumoured to have disappeared, so you have decided to loot his property. Can you avoid the dogs, the traps, and the mysterious inhabitants of the house to find the treasure? The Secret of Bastow manor is a text-based adventure game. Apart from the Vic20 release, it also has rudimentary graphics. The game provides very limited descriptions of the surroundings. The C64 port lists the items in the area with which you can interact. The parser accepts noun/verb combinations, such as "READ NOTE", "OPEN DOOR" or "CLIMB TREE". It also accepts abbreviations for the cardinal directions, such as "N" for North, to move to a new location. Directions of room exits are provided by entering the command "G", and "I" lists your currently held inventory.
