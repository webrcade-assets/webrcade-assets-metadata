Galactic Assault is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a small vessel at the bottom of the screen that moves laterally and fires forwards. Enemy vessels approach from above and fire towards the player. Each level contains a number of slow moving aliens and faster moving round space ships. When all enemies are defeated, a large alien saucer appears at the top of the screen which must be hit several times before being destroyed for bonus points. The player starts with 5 ships, and gains a new ship for every level completed.
