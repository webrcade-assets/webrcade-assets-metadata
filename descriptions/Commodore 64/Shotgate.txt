Shotgate was developed for the annual Mini Game Competition and was an entry for the 4k size category. It is a reworking of the Portal concept. Players need to survive through 26 rooms in a secret laboratory where the new Shotgate technology of jumping is tested. Each level is set on a single screen where the player can move left or right, but he cannot jump. Using the gun gates can be shot into walls or ceilings. As soon as two gates are set, the character can enter one to be immediately warped to the other gate. Ammunition is limited and so is the time available per level. As such, certain gates need to be re-used to save ammo. As with the game it is based on, there is a promise of cake at the end of the game. From the main menu passwords can be entered to go to the levels directly.
