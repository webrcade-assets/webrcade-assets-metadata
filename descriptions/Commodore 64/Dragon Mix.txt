Dragon Mix is a math learning game for the Apple II. The player controls a large dragon defending a city on the right of the screen. Math equations represented by spaceships quickly approach from the left, and an answer appears on the dragon's belly. The goal is to shoot the spaceship that has the correct equation. If a spaceship gets too close, it shoots the city. If the city is shot three times, it's game over, and the player receives their final score.
