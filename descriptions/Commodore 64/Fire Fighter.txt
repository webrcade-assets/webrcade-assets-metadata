Fire Fighter is a one player strategy game. The player's job is to stop a rapidly spreading forest fire. The nearby countryside is displayed on a grid which includes woods, lakes, and houses. Each turn, the player is able to drop water, set a back fire, or dig a fire break. The goal is to defeat the fires while minimizing property damage to the surrounding countryside. Constantly changing wind conditions affect the speed and direction of the spread of the fire. The player has a limited time to make each moves as the fire spreads. There are 9 levels of fire difficulty.
