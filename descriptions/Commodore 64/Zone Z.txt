Zone Z is a vertical shoot'em up. Your ship is flying over a smooth scrolling landscape and you can shoot at enemy ships. The ship can be controlled left and right and also up and down to a certain degree is possible. After a miniboss you face the end boss of the level. If you defeat him, you can fly through a bonus stage that lets you collect extra points as a reward. Then the game repeats itself with a different graphic tile set.
