Killer Piller is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. The player tries to protect their forest from a hungry invading caerpillar.  The player controls a character who moves laterally at the bottom of the screen and fires vertically.  A caterpillar enters from the top corner of the screen, and begins munching plants.  As caterpillars are shot they break into more pieces, which also begin munching.  As short sections snack they elongate once again.  Caterpillars lay eggs which when shot turn into moths.  These will flutter towards the player and cost a life if hit.  Blue moths flutter slowly while red moths streak towards the player.  When a moth is hit it falls to the bottom of the screen and blocks the player's shots.  When all caterpillar sections are destroyed the player moves to the next level.  There are 2 levels of difficulty.  If the entire garden is eaten, it's game over.  If the player loses 3 lives it's game over.
