Scortia is an arcade game, a clone of Arkanoid. The gameplay features all the classic elements. The task requires clearing the play field of the blocks by hitting a ball with the paddle positioned at the bottom of the screen. Certain blocks release bonuses or unsafe surprises. Shiny bricks can't be removed from the board, causing the ball to rebound in various directions. The game features 25 levels.
