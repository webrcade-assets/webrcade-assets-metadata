Nederlandse Topografie is an educational computer game which teaches the locations and names of cities and places in The Netherlands. The game contains a map of The Netherlands with many names and locations of cities, towns, lakes, rivers, regions and provinces. There are 3 modes, which are Opzoeken (Look up), Overhoring (Quiz), Het Stedenspel (The City Game), and 4 difficulty levels. In Look Up mode you can type names of a city or river and the game will point it out on the map. In Quiz mode, the game will point at a randomly selected place and the player must type in the name within the time limit. The input is very strict, if the player makes a typo and misspells even just one letter it is considered incorrect. The helicopter mode is the main part of the game. In this mode the game randomly displays the name of a city or location, and the player controls a helicopter which must fly to that location before the time runs out. When the helicopter is close enough to the target city or location, it will turn into a pulsating red dot. Each correct city or location is one point, get 5 errors and the game ends. In Quiz mode or The City Game, after 15 points the game goes to a higher difficulty level and it will start selecting less common cities, smaller towns and more obscure rivers.
