Identikit is an educational program that helps children aged two to eight become familiar with the keyboard. By choosing from a range of features, you can build a face on the screen. It is possible to create fifteen thousand different faces. Once the face is complete it can be animated in Section 2. This could be wiggling the nose, winking the eyes, making the mouth smile, etc. Section 3 can store a face on blank tape. On the BBC Micro and Electron Section 3 (4 on the C64) is a memory test. The computer displays a face on the screen for 30 seconds. The child must then try to get the same features back on the face. Use SPACE and RETURN to select the functions. If you think the face is correct, press a red key on the BBC Micro and on the Electron use the function key 1.
