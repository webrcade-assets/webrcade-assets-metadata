In Air Support, you control a helicopter, and must aid your android army, in an early real-time strategy game. The player is in control of an army of robots, which must be guided by your command chopper. Your chopper has the ability to drop bombs to destroy enemy robots, but can also be used to transfer your robots about the map. The chopper can also give commands to tell the nearest friendly androids to move to a specific site or attack a specific target. The ultimate goal is to destroy the entirety of the enemy forces. There is a strategic and an arcade game option. In the strategic option, only enemy androids attack. In arcade mode, the enemy also possess twirlers which rapidly destroy friendly troops, and enemy missile silos which will take down your helicopter. There are a total of 7 different game modes, with different starting scenarios, troop deployment, and winning goals. The player can also define the type of terrain, and the number of enemy and friendly robots on each side. Victory is ultimately obtained by reaching the winning condition of the 7 individual games. You have a total of 5 helicopters on arcade mode, and when all are lost, it's game over.
