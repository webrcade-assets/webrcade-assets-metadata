Monday Morning Manager is a baseball management game that continues the tradition of the primarily text-based predecessors like SSI's Computer Baseball and Computer Statis Pro Baseball. It includes 64 major league teams from 1905 through the 1985 playoff teams, with 1,500 players and pitchers in total. Most of the game is text based, but there is also a graphical display of the matches. Players can create custom teams or manage existing ones. It is also possible to print rosters, box scores and league leaders.
