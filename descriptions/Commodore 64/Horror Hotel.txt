Horror Hotel is a Dutch text adventure where you wake up in a broom closet of the Horror Hotel after being knocked unconscious and left there by the creepy Dr. A. Cula. He used to be a vampire and now works in the hospitality industry. Since you have the suspicion that Dr. A. Cula has no good intentions with you, your objective is to lift the curse from the Horror Hotel and kill Dr. A. Cula. The screen has simple text describing your location. You type in verb-noun commands to interact with your surroundings, such as "open deur" (open door) or "pak bezem" (take broom). It is possible to give one-letter commands such as 'n(oord)', 'z(uid)', 'o(ost)', 'w(est)' for wind directions, and 'h(oog)' and 'l(aag)' for general directions. When you type 'k(ijk)' (look at) you get a description of the location. If you want to know what you have in your possession you need to type 'b(ezit)' (possession). Type "help" (help) to get hints and "nieuw" (new) if you want to restart the game. In the top left of the screen is a map showing the places for each floor of the hotel you have already found. On the top right are the possible exits and whether objects can be found or not. The game has a time limit though and after '100' steps, Dr. A. Cula comes looking for you.
