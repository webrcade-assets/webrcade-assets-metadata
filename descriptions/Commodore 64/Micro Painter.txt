Micro Painter is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player moves along the lines of a 6 x 5 graph, and tries to color in all of the squares by moving around the 4 sides of a square.  The player can only highlight a single square at a time, and can not backtrack.  The player must avoid 4 enemies that randomly follow along the lines of the graph.  The goal is the color all squares in the minimal amount of time.  If they run out of time or are attacked by an enemy, it's game over.
