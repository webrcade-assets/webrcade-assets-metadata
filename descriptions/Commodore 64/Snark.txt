In Snark the player must find the Snark which is hidden in an 10x10 grid. Each turn the player can give a coordinate and a radius. The game will then say if the Snark is inside, outside or on the given circle. The player can make a guess of the actual position by giving a coordinate and a radius of zero. The game keeps track of how many tries the player needed.
