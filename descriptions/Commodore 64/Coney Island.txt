Coney Island is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a penguin who works an ice-cream stand in the Antarctic. Customers approach the stand, and the penguin must swim to the corresponding ice floes to make the correct ice-cream come in the correct order. The penguin can move quickly while in the water, but moves slowly while on land. Ice floes move from the left to right, and if the penguin moves off the right of the screen, a life is lost. Further, jumping fish can steal the penguin's cone, causing a loss of life. At higher levels, there is more variety to ice cream types, but the reward for a successful order is greater. The player starts with 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
