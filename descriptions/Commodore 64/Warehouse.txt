Warehouse places the player in the role of a supervisor of a warehouse. Orders must be made, shipments must be stored, work units assigned, and all within a time limit. Each day in the office is represented by one minute of gameplay. If the player makes a mess of it he or she will be reprimanded by the boss. Tasks are visible on the work board, if it overflows the player is fired.
