Speed Racer is a top-down racing game where the player controls a car on a vertically-scrolling never-ending road. A timer ticks down from 100, and when it reaches zero, one of the player's three cars is removed. A car is also lost when it crashes into a road obstacle or a parked car. There are also people on the road - policemen, grannies, children on bikes and more. The game is played for high score in three categories: miles driven, heavenly and devilish points. Heavenly and devilish points are awarded for avoiding and driving over people, respectively. An extra car is awarded for every 100 miles driven.
