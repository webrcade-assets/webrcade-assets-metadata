Space Orbs is a co-op match-three puzzle game, where each player controls a space ship on each side of the screen, or one player switches side. Each ship can pull up to three orbs from the board and push orbs back to match orbs in order to destroy them. Each player ship can also trade orbs by pulling or pushing above the remaining orbs. The game does not progress by time but instead after a number of moves such as pulling or pushing or trading orbs. This means that it is better to try to take it slow and plan ahead and talk to the other player than to rush things. To control the space ship use up and down to move between lines. Use left and right to pull or push orbs. The game introduces more obstacles as the game progresses such as bugs that can only be destroyed by clearing neighbouring orbs, or beans that are blocking until a neighbouring orb is cleared, which turns the bean into an orb of the same color as the cleared orbs.
