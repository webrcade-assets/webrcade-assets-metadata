Your objective in Gunslinger is simply to shoot targets within various locations, keeping your skills sharp for when you have to take down one of the Wild West's most wanted. Among the levels are a typical shooting range, the open plains with bandit-shaped targets, and a high-risk saloon shootout. Bonus points are secured at the end of each level by not wasting ammunition, encouraging accuracy. One of five Software Creations' games exclusively bundled with the Commodore 64 version of the Magnum Light Phaser gun peripheral, Gunslinger is available alongside Baby Blues, Cosmic Storm, Ghost Town and GooseBusters.
