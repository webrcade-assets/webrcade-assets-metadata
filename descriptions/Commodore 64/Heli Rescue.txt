You control a helicopter in order to find 30 keys scattered in the vast maze and rescue the captives from the caches your enemies have imprisoned them. There are four types of characters who will be helpful on a way to accomplish the mission. Each character has its own color and the player needs to pick them up and deliver to correct houses with a corresponding flag waving on the roof. The characters will reward the player for bringing them home: pink ones will provide a key, eight yellow ones will give an extra life, blinking ones will give assist in order to recover unreachable keys. The helicopter can have up to four characters on board.
