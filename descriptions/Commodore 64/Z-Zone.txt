Z-Zone is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up. The graphics are very much inspired by Andrew Braybrook's "Alleykat", but the gameplay is much different. Your ship is flying very slow while you can pick up the letter "P" and shoot the jumping dots for points. Sometimes enemy ship formations fly down the screen which you can shoot with your weapon. Hitting anything is your instant death: enemy ships, obstacles or jumping dots. After flying some time the ship suddenly flies a bit faster, but you cannot control the speed yourself.
