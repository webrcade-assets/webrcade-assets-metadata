Dawn Patrol is a World War II submarine simulator in which the player takes command of a British "T" class submarine: the 'Beowolf' against the combined German and Italian naval forces. Carry out all assignments listed in the ship's log until the ultimate goal has been achieved: Victory of the Allied forces over the Axis' naval forces. The screen has two parts: 2/3 is filled by the main screen. This main screen provides a periscope view of the environment. It also provides an overview of the speed, depth, course, oxygen and periscope direction via several gauges. On the right side, the remaining 1/3 part is to obtain the most appropriate information depending on the situation. There is a choice of five different screens and can be selected using the function keys. The engine room (F1) provides information such as pressure and fuel gauges. F2 (Commodore "F3") shows the torpedo room, this should only be activated when the player launches an attack on an enemy ship. F3 (Commodore "F5") shows the map which gives an impression of the immediate surroundings of the ship. F4 (Commodore "F7") gives the damage report. F5 (Commodore "RETURN") is the ship's log. This allows to obtain information such as the assignment and course to the destination. This destination or assignment can vary from sinking a ship to picking up agents. Select first the motor and then the speed. E is Electric and D is Diesel. CTRL increases the speed and SHIFT decreases it. STOP will stop all engines. INS fills reserve tanks, DEL empties the reserve tanks and HOME stops filling/emptying. The cursor keys correspond to the joystick movement input. Pressing down will cause the submarine to dive and pressing up will rise the submarine to the surface. When speed is 0, the sub can only submerge or surface using the tanks that regulate the pressure. If the mission is to sink a ship or convoy and the target is in sight, launch a torpedo by pressing SPACE + 1, 2,..., 6 simultaneously.
