An all-strategy baseball simulator done entirely in text.  Players can use existing teams, draft players from existing teams, or create their own from scratch.  Gameplay involves answering yes/no questions (should your fielder throw to home, should your runner try to steal second) as the players' actions are described textually.  Other screens exist for box scores and stats. While the game contains real team and player names, they are not licensed.
