Cliffhanger is a 1-player arcade game for the TRS-80 CoCo. The player controls a small character who can move forwards and jump vertically or horizontally. While trying to climb a hill, the player must avoid boulders, holes, and snake pits. During each screen, the water levels slowly rises, and the player must finish each screen before the water catches them. The player gains points for each screen finished, and starts with 5 lives.
