One morning Paddington was in the garden testing some tricks from his conjuring outfit when he came across one he hadn't noticed before. It was called magic disappearing ink and it looked very interesting indeed. So starts Paddington's encounter with the magic ink, for he soon discovered to his regret that writing a postcard with disappearing ink is not easy. Paddington and the Disappearing Ink is an educational game that aims to help with basic letter writing skills in the age range of 7 to 9. The program consists of five programs: Letter - This program shows how to set out a letter. Typewriter - This program can be used to write instant ‘thank you’ and ‘Having-a-nice-time’ letters. Posthaste - Move Paddington around a street plan with the arrow keys to get to a postbox before the postman empties it. He can run on the paths but he must keep off the grass. Also, the park gates may be locked. Wordcheck - The player must make as many words as possible from the name -PADDINGTON. Three-letter words score one point, but longer ones score more. A letter can't be used twice. Peru - This is a geography lesson about the countries in South America. A map of that area appears showing where Peru and Lima are. This is where Paddington came from. His Aunt Lucy lives there, she has gone to live in the Home for Retired Bears. Included with this game is an illustrated storybook with Paddington Bear, specially written by Michael and Karen Bond, that serves as a preamble to the 5 programs.
