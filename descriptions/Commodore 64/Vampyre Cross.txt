An evil vampire and his nefarious minions plague a forested land; the task is set before the player to do something about it, most likely with the assistance of a sword. This text adventure, a nominal sequel to 1986's Vampyre Hunter, could well have stepped right out of a time capsule from those 20 years hence (and into your C64 emulator), eschewing any nuance or sophistication since distilled into the genre: if VERB NOUN won't do it, it doesn't need to be done. The trickiest business here is internal managing of health status and armor levels for survival of do-or-die attacks against wolves and other such bestial gothic menaces.
