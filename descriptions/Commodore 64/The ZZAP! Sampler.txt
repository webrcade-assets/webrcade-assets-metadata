The ZZAP! Sampler is a covermount tape from the June 1987 issue of ZZAP! magazine, containing some game demos and one original game from Jeff Minter called Made in France II. Originally intended to be the pause mode for Return of the Mutant Camels, but was dropped because of memory constraints. The game is a simple two player Breakout clone where the bricks are in the centre and behind each player. The player's bats are at the upper and lower half of the screen. If a player lets the ball leave the screen, the round is lost. The original Made in France, was a Deflex clone used as the pause mode of Iridis Alpha. The included demos and programs on Side A are:* Two levels (0 and 12) of Gribbly's Special Day Out A rolling demo of an unnamed and since unreleased 3D space trading Sensible Software game, provisionally called "The Day The Universe Died" A single level of Return of the Mutant Camels, there titled "Revenge II" Mix-E-Load, the loader from Delta where you can play with the loading music using the joystick, altering the lead voice, bass, drums and FX.
