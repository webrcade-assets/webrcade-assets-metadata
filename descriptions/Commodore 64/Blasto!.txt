Blasto! is a single player-only port of the game Blasto. The game play remains the same. Within a given time limit the player must try to get as high a score as possible by destroying mines. The player can move around the mine field and fire bullets to destroy a mine. Destroying a mine will cause a chain reaction so the player must be careful not to stand next to other mines that might kill him or her.
