Number Bowling is a math game for one or two players. The player must quickly answer math questions, including reading, writing, and comparing decimals. The player then rolls a bowling ball, and the number of pins they knock over from 5-10 is dependent upon how quickly they answer the question. The player tries to maximize score over 10 frames. There are 3 different difficulty levels.
