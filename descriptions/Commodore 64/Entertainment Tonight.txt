Entertainment Tonight is a 1 - 6 player trivia game for the Commodore 64. Players answer a variety of general knowledge trivia, and must correctly type the answer. As the players answer questions, they fill in sections of the letters of the word TRIVIA. If a letter is already filled, and the player answers a question in that section, they get to repeat a question. There are 3 levels of question difficulty, and players can chose 20, 40, or 60 seconds to answer questions.
