in Vortex Raider the player is riding a Jet bike with lights, cooling and oxygen. They must dodge between columns and shoot 5 of each creature by lining up your laser cannons. The journey takes in across forest, temple and sea. The final goal is to reach the Golden Treasure Chest, dodge the attacks from the guardians you face, and creep up to the treasure. Make contact with a guardian and you can only escape without treasure, ready for another loop of the game.
