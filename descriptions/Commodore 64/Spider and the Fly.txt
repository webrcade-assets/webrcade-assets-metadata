Spider and the Fly is a 1 - 4 player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The hungry spider tries to catch flies for dinner. The spider can move in all directions, and leaves a short web trail behind as it moves. The player attempts to catch flies using a spiderweb by encircling them. If the player bumps into a fly or crosses over their own web, their web is shortened. A small hand follows after the spider, and if the hand touches the web the spider falls to its death. Cans of bug spray move about, and will kill the spider if touched. Each level the player must eat a number of flies to advance to the next level. The player starts with 10 lives.
