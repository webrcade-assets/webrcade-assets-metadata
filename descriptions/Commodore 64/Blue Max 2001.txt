In this sequel to Synapse 's Blue Max, it is the year 2001 and you are flying a flying saucer. You're trying to bomb enemy targets while not getting shot (or rammed) by enemy saucers or shot by ground cannon. If the screen border starts flashing yellow, you are dangerously close to the ground. If the border is red, you are hitting the ground. If the border is gray, you are flying low but not TOO low. If the border is light blue, then the enemy ship is at the same altitude as you. The player takes on the role of Max Chatsworth IX, a direct descendant of the original Blue Max. When the game ends a final ranking is given based on points accumulated and time elapsed.
