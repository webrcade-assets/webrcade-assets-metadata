Life is life simulates the growth of bacterial colonies. At the beginning, the player establishes a colony of bacteria, and then watches them multiply and die. Different colors of bacteria mean different species. While observing the simulation, the player can go to the editing stage at any time and make any changes to the bacterial colony.
