Trap-A-Zoid is an educational game in which the player must capture aliens which wander around on a grid (resembling dotted graph paper) by drawing examples of the specified polygons to enclose them. If the player traps a "Super Zoid", it will escape their trap and they will be required to answer a geometry question before it reaches the edge of the screen.
