Snooker & Pool is a twin pack containing the games of Snooker and 8-Ball Pool. The game is viewed from above showing the whole of the table. After the white ball has been placed in the half-circle, positioning a cursor allows one to choose the intended direction of the shot. Optionally, spin for the shot can be selected from eight different directions, and power for the shot is chosen by moving a power bar. The game can be played against the computer (in three skill levels: Novice, Amateur and Professional) or against a human player. The game also includes an editor to set up trick shots.
