Frogman is a 1 - 2 player arcade game for multiple systems. The player controls a scuba diver, who tries to gather all the pearls in a maze, while avoiding sharks that move about. A spear is located in each of the 4 corners of the maze, which temporarily make the sharks vulnerable. The player loses a life if caught by a shark. If they collect all pearls, they move to a more difficult level. There are 9 levels of game speed, and the player starts with 3 lives.
