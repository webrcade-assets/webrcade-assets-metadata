Puzzle Tanks is a single-player educational logic game for multiple systems. The player has two canisters of different size, and can fill, empty, or move the liquid from one canister to the other. The goal is to get a volume of fluid that is different than that provided by either of the two measured cups. On lower difficulty levels, the player is given a large tanker truck to fill, while on more difficult levels, the goal is to get the correct volume in just one of the two canisters. The player can be given impossible tasks, and has an option to declare a problem impossible. There are a total of four difficulty levels.
