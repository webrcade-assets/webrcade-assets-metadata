Go to the Head of the Class is a trivia game for one to six players. Based upon the Milton Bradley board game of the same name, players attempt to travel through a number of different classrooms to be the first player to graduate. There are three difficulty levels available. Players take turns rolling dice, which determines how many desks they travel. As they travel to different classrooms, they receive multiple choice trivia questions related to the topic they are in. If the player answers the question correctly, they move forwards.
