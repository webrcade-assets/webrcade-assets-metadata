Front Page is a 1â€“7 player strategy game for the Commodore 64. In this game of strategy and power, the player joins the ranks of press barons in the struggle for dominance.  Set in an imaginary right-wing state headed by the unenlightened President Zola, the player must walk a political tightrope between not upsetting those in power, but also not alienating the readership and losing it to rival newspapers.  As editor and journalist, the player must choose stories carefully, and must avoid upsetting the newsroom staff to avoid walk outs.
