Blockbusters is a 1â€“2 player trivia game based upon the Bob Holness-hosted quiz show, where players answer questions to race across the game board. At the beginning of each stage there are 20 hexagons, each represented by a single letter.  The player selects a letter, and the answer to the trivia question begins with that letter.  If the player gets the answer correct they receive the space, otherwise the space is lost.  The first player to gather connecting spaces that lead across the game board is the winner. After two games are complete, the player enters the Gold Run phase, where they must enter words or phrases to cross the board.
