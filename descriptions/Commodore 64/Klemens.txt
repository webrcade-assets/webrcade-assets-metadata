Klemens is a platform game where the player must rescue eight of his twin brothers locked in the cages scattered around the labyrinth. Destroying the cages requires finding the dynamite. Unfortunately Klemens may carry only one item at a time, so finding a brother without dynamite requires remembering the back route. The labyrinth consists of 256 chambers inhabited by numerous hostile animals and other obstacles, such as ground spikes, bouncing balls or coming from the ground skeletons. Each enemy may be annihilated by jumping on it. Contact with hostile creature or obstacles takes some energy, which may be supplemented by energy potions and temporary immortality shields.
