Carling the Spider is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. Spiders like dark places, and Carling The Spider was no different. In fact, he was very proud of the vast abandoned mine he called home, and had lived there happily for many years, undisturbed. With that in mind, imagine his surprise when he awoke one morning to find his home had been transformed into a high security diamond vault, littered with traps and guarded by the ominous automated balls of steel. To shut down the security system, Carling has to collect all the diamonds on each level and escape to the exit door. Carling can jump and move laterally. Spring platforms allow the spider to jump to higher platforms, and Carling must avoid deadly mushrooms and spikes. The bouncing balls of steel also pose a danger. Carling starts with 3 lives, and can pick up hearts through his adventure.
