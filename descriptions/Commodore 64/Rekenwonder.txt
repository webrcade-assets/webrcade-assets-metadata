Rekenwonder is a Dutch educational program that aims to teach children mental arithmetic in a playful combination of action and math skills. It consists of two programs: Somregen - In this game, the player has to reach a helicopter, while they have to flee from bubbles, which float down towards a laser beam. These bubbles, which always consist of two digits and an arithmetic symbol, form a calculation. If the math is solved correctly, the balloons will burst and a person will get closer and closer to the helicopter. The game is over when the person reaches the helicopter and flies away with it. If you answer incorrectly or too late, the balloons will be destroyed by the laser beam. But each time the laser beam gets weaker and weaker until it disappears. Then the next one will be fatal. Rekenflat - In this game each player takes turns solving an arithmetic calculation and has to type in the correct result quickly. If the answer is correct your character moves a little further on a platform. If you make a wrong input you will stop. There is a time limit of 10 seconds. While the computer is waiting for an answer, a figure moves from left to right across the screen. If the time limit is over, you will be sent back as a penalty. The object of the game is to be the first to ring the bell on the top floor. The type of sums can be set (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division or combinations thereof) in both Somregen (for one player) and Rekenflat (for two players). The difficulty level can also be set as desired between 1-9. Then you also have to indicate the speed, also from 1 to 9.
