You don't how it happened but you are a normal person who has somehow been transported to a strange place. You have two choices, wander this abnormal place forever or try to escape back to your normal world. As you explore you realise how strange things are and how the laws of physics don't apply. Total Reality Delusion is a text adventure where the screen has text describing your location and you type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
