Dreadnought is a 2-player strategy game for the Commodore 64. Two fleets engage each other during the years 1895â€“1918, covering scenarios including the Battle of Tsushima and the Battle of Jutland. Each player takes control of their fleet of up to 10 dreadnought or pre-dreadnought ships.  Players have 100 million pounds to purchase battleships, old battle ships, battle cruisers, and armored cruisers. These are then placed in divisional positions from the far left to the far right.  The initial speed of these battalions is then chosen. The game then shows the engagement screen, where the vessels are represented.  As ships come within range, they can choose targets to fire upon. Individual ships have different armor and offensive ratings, and once all ships of one team have been destroyed or left the field of combat, it's game over.
