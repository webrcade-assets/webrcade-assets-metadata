A simulation that has you flying Mail runs from many different airports in one of three states of America which are Kansas, Colorado and Washington (choosing Washington does allow you to fly in neighbouring state Oregon as well). Advanced features include VOR towers readings, DME and ILS. Score for choices made meaning you must ponder certain things like how much fuel you might need for each delivery. Each mail delivered is to a different airport but the option is also there to carry several loads, each an additional weight that needs to be taken into account. Having a heavier payload means burning more fuel and a difference to how the plane handles, but potentially a higher score can result. Various weather conditions such as clear, nightime, light cloud and even a heavy cloud that requires IFR skills. It's entirely possible to fly using just instruments in total cloud blindness up until the point you pop out of a cloud to see the runway hopefully as you had planned. Indeed an accurately planned route using both VORS can have yourself precisely lined up and ready for a final descent using ILS. You really do need the maps though and attempting Solo Flight without them is fairly pointless - playing this seriously requires maps for VOR plotting.
