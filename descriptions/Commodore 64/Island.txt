Island is a strategy game, where the player must perform appropriate actions to survive and get out of a deserted island. In each turn only one type of action may be taken: collecting water, looking for a food, sending a message, gathering planks, resting. Selected activities involve danger and specific consequences. The key to success is gathering stocks, appropriate distribution forces and avoiding hazards. Escape is possible after building a raft or finding a letter in a bottle by a ship.
