Snowball Sunday is a side-view single-screen game where you play the role of William Warmstart who is having a snowball fight with his friends. There is no aim or end game, the idea is just to have fun trying to knock people on their bums while avoiding being hit yourself. Once a snowball has been thrown then you have to bend over and pick up more snow to throw another snowball. You can run left or right along the screen while your opponents do the same.
