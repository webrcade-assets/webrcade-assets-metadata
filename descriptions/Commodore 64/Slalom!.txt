Slalom! is a 1-player arcade downhill skiing game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a downhill skier, as they race from a behind perspective around a series of flags on a hill. The skier can accelerate, decelerate, and move to the left or right. The skier must move to the flag side of each pole or receive a significant time penalty. Rocks and gravel are found on the hill, and the player can crash if they hit these. The skier can potentially jump over these dangers for safety. There are 4 different levels of game speed and an option for an advanced slope with wide gates.
