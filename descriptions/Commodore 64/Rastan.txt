Rastan features six stages of hacking and slashing gameplay with a boss fight at the end of each one. Numerous enemies assault you on your journey such as flying demons, chimeras, valkyries, piranhas, undead, and more. Fight through to the end and save the land of Lograth from certain doom. The game features different weapons such as axes, maces, and fire swords, each with its own attributes like extended range or attack power, and defensive items like shields, cloaks, and armors, reducing the damage from enemy attacks. Other items include rings (increase the speed of your weapon) and jewelry for bonus points.
