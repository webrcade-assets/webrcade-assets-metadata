Terror Tank is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. You are the fearsome Captain Terror, who was forced to crash land his spacecraft on an unknown Romulan planet. You must escape from their deadly labyrinth by collecting the 7 parts of the Hypercom which are spread throughout the maze. The player explores a large 2D scrolling maze from a top-down perspective. The tank can move in the cardinal directions and fire directly forwards. Armed with only 5 shots, the player can rearm at depot squares. Numerous dangers inhabit the labyrinth including moving laser fields, tight corners, terrible enemies, and crushing walls. If the tank touches anything, it's destroyed. Teleport squares allow random movement throughout the maze, and the player starts with a total of 3 lives.
