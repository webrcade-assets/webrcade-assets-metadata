World Soccer League is a football management game taking place in a two division league containing the top teams in the world, 16 in each division, with a cup competition also contested. Managing one of the six UK teams invited (though their name can be changed) the goal is to first win promotion to the top division, then win the league and cup double. The player starts with 16 players from the UK to choose a team of 11 starters and 2 subs from - these players are rated on form (scored from 0 to 15, affected by his performance and the team's overall success) and assigned a position, with their appearances and goals scored or conceded tracked throughout the season. New players can be signed by asking for a position and being presented with a player who you can choose to sign, but a limit of 3 foreign players (in keeping with the real European competitions of the day) is in force. Attempting to sell players sees an offer generated, with the option of declining it. Loans can be obtained or paid back from the bank. During the match the player is told where the ball is and who has it, and is alerted to shots at goal, while substitutions can be made at any time. At full time a list of the other results is presented, followed by the week's finances and any player news.
