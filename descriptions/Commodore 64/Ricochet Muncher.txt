Ricochet Muncher is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a turret on the bottom of the screen which moves horizontally and fires vertically. A small character bounces about the screen, and the player tries to shoot it. If the player hits the character before the timer on the top of the screen runs out, the player gains 100 points. Otherwise, the computer gains 200 points. Every few hits, another row of objects for the character to bounce off appears.
