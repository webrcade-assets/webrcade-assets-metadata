Magic Spells is an early educational program for multiple systems. Designed to teach children age 6 - 10 basic spelling and grammar rules, it consists of a series of three mini-games with animated graphics and sound. In each section, the player can choose words from a number of categories, including: animals, orchestra, fruit, and more. Scramble Spells - The player is given a list of words, and the letters have been scrambled. The player must correctly unscramble each word. Flash Spells - Words are displayed on the screen for a few seconds, and the player must memorize their spelling and correctly type them. Players can create and modify their own set of words, and copy them to another disk to allow other players to participate.
