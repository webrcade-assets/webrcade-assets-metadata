Duel Attack is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a plane that moves in all directions, and fires two streams of bullets directly forwards. Enemy planes and helicopters take off and launch towards the player.  Tanks drive across fields and fire, while ships move along ocean sections firing directly forwards.  Immobile anti-aircraft also pose danger.  There is a single large level divided into two sections with multiple enemies that scrolls past, at which point the level restarts. If the ship is hit by enemy fire or vessels it's lost, and the player starts with 3 ships.
