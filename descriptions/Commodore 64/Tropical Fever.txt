In Tropical Fever you are a zookeeper who is tasked to catch wild animals for the zoo. The job is not going to be smooth as the animals are not willing to get caught. You have to lure them to a cage with a banana, by firing a water pistol or using gates. As if that wasn't enough, a mischievous monkey will do anything to waste your time by jumping on your head and slowing down your speed, while a hostile red rhino hunts you down trying to kill you. Once all animals (a panther, two gorillas and a phoenix) are caught, you must try to keep them in their cages. This is a difficult task as the cages will catch fire, the animals will escape and become lethal to touch. The game can be played by one player or two players alternately and each level is displayed as a single screen where you must catch an animal. Completing a level will get you an extra life.
