High Roller is a 1st-person Harrier jet plane simulator, developed with the aid of the British Aerospace. Your sole mission is to destroy a terrorist headquarters 500 miles from your base, encountering ground forces to destroy and Mig-23 opponents to dogfight on your way. Another obstacle is learning to fly the peculiar Harrier, with it's Vertical thrusts, for example. At your disposal are a series of weapons, like bombs and missiles, and a number of instruments with which you can control your plane, as one would expect from a simulation (radars, inventories, fuel indicators).
