In part two of the Boulder Dash series the overall game design hasn't changed compared to the original, but sixteen new levels have been created. The basis of the game is the same, you still have to mine diamonds while avoiding falling rocks and cave monsters of all sorts. As in part one, later levels become more difficult because many puzzle elements are added.
