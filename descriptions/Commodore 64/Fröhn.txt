Fröhn is a platforming puzzle game for the Commodore 64. Fröhn must try to save his captured Fröhnline, by completing a number of platforming puzzles. Fröhn can move laterally, jump, climb ladders, pick up and throw objects. In the first section, the player must avoid Goths and Black Warts, while they feed red loaves to a creature at the bottom left of the screen. After feeding enough loaves, the player can feed their Donk into a machine which turns the woman who blocks progress into a sow. In the next section, the player must catch bags of money while avoiding poisonous loaves of bread to defeat the black cat. In the final stages, the player must defeat owls and avoid lightning bolts, and then go underground to defeat dogs that are blown from bubbles by a large whale. Finally, they can rescue their Fröhnline from her imprisonment. The player starts with 5 lives, and loses a life every time they are hit by an enemy.
