Cracky is a simple platform game in which the player has to collect all of the stars before the time runs out. Whilst most of the platforms are solid, some of them can only be passed through once, and the player can't jump, so a bit of strategy is required to collect all of the stars. After a level is cleared, another one with more enemies and stars follows. There are two ways with which lives can be lost; coming into contact with an enemy or running out of time. Once every one of those lives are gone, the game will be over.
