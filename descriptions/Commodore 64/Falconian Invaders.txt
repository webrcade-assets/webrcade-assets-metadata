Falconian Invaders is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. You are at the console of a space fighter attempting to ward off the attacking fleet in a never ending battle to stay alive. Controlled from a viewpoint behind the ship, the player can move in all directions as alien vessels approach. The player receives more points for shooting an alien vessel further away. The player has limited fuel, but receives a bonus for every enemy hit. There is a regular and advanced mode. In regular mode, the player automatically tracks enemy vessels, and merely needs to position their ship near an alien and fire. In advanced mode, the player must precisely align their ship with the enemy before firing.
