Quest is a roleplaying game for multiple systems. The people of the kingdom have long suffered under the evil rule of Morlock, the master of the Dark Castle in the southern reaches of the realm. Many have tried to overcome him, only to be crushed by his mighty forces. Now you, brave adventurer, have come to test your strength and cunning in search of victory where so many others have failed. The player starts with an army of 10 men, and must travel an overworld map in search of enemies with the goal of conquering Morlock's Tower. Each man can carry 100 lbs of equipment. As the player travels, they must make sure their party is well-fed with rations, which can be increased by destroying enemies or purchasing them from the cities. As the player explores the overworld, they can encounter monsters, towers, castles, and ruins. There are 2 towns on the map, and terrain includes mountains, swamps, and plains. Swamps and mountains can cause damage to the party. Monsters randomly appear on the overworld. Enemies can be run from, engaged in combat, or can be approached on friendly terms to join the party. During combat each party is measured by their men, weapons, and experience. Luck is randomly rolled each turn, and the player can choose to fight, run away, or ask for terms. Every failed fight leads to loss of men. Combat continues until one side has run away or lost all fighters. The player must purchase arms and armor to increase the attack strength of their party. Dungeons, towers, and castle require special items to enter, and the player gains bonuses by raiding these sites. Boats can be purchased to cross the river, and siege engines are required to assault the Dark Castle.
