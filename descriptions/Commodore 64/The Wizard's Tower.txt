Wizard's Tower is a roleplaying game for the TRS-80 CoCo. The wizard King Zastor ruled your kingdom for over 100 years, through the powers of the three magical talismans: the Scepter of Speed, the Ring of Strength, and the Crown of Wisdom. As he lay dying, he magically hid the three talismans in the dungeon under his tower, and protected them with magical monsters. He then charged that any who could find the three talismans and return them to town would be proclaimed king. The player chooses from 3 classes: wizard, warrior, or elf. The wizard has great ability to use spells but possesses limited combat prowess. The warrior is the opposite, and the elf is in the middle. The player starts in an overworld map beside the town. In the town, the player can purchase armor, weapons, spells, and rations. As the player explores the overworld, and then the dungeons within the tower, they can do combat with a variety of enemies represented by letters moving randomly about the levels. During combat, each turn the player can try to attack, run away, or cast a spell. The player and enemy exchange blows until one has perished. Most battles are rewarded with gold, which can be used to improve the player's equipment or rations. As the player defeats enemies, their maximum hit points increases. The player can find treasure chests and stairs up and down within dungeons. The goal is to find the 3 talismans, and return them to town for victory.
