Elevator Ride (To Danger) is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player tries to climb down a 10 floor elevator shaft, while trying to avoid being hit by the descending elevator. When the player stops descending, the elevator picks up speed. When the player climbs quickly, the elevator slows down. If the player touches the top or the bottom of the elevator, they fall to their doom. There are 3 levels of difficulty.
