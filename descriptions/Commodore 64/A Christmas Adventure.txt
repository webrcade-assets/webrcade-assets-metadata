A Christmas Adventure is a customizable adventure game by Bitcards, released just prior to Christmas 1983. You have been whisked to Santa's workshop to help him save Christmas. Typing simple two-word commands, you explore the workshop, defeat a few evil elves, and eventually save the holiday. The game was designed so that certain texts and graphics could be updated such that Santa explicitly calls on your gift recipient to save the day.
