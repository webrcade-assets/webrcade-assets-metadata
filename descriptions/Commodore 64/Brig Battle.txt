Brig Battle is a 2-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Each player controls a sailing vessel, and can fire in any direction except for the bow or stern. Each ship can take a limited number of hits, defined by the player at the beginning of each match. Players must avoid fire from nearby forts. Continuously changing wind conditions affect boat movement. Ships cannot move directly upwind, and vessels must take several seconds to reload. Players receive a score based upon the amount of damage they have remaining at the end of each battle.
