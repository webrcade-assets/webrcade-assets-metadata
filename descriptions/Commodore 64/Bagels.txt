Bagels is a mastermind game where the player must guess the computer's code and the computer will try to guess the player's code at the same time. Codes are four characters long and consist of the letters A through F in any order and duplication. After each guess of the computer the player must answer how many of the letters are exact (on the right position) and matches (in the code, but on a different position). The computer does the same for the player's guesses. Whoever guesses the code first wins.
