SS Panzer is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a tank that moves in all directions, and fires a stream of bullets directly forwards. The tank can move and fire straight forwards, sideways, and at 45 degree angles.  Enemy turrets, planes, tanks, helicopters, and battleships pose dangers to the tank.  Terrain includes enemy bases, bridges, grasslands, islands, and even minefields.   There is a single large level that loops after being completed.  There are also large boss helicopters, which prevent the tank from moving forwards until destroyed.   If the ship is hit by enemy fire or vessels it's lost, and the player starts with 3 ships.
