Light-Waves is a 1-player game for the Commodore 64. Only you can control the energy flow of the network and return the light-rider to its energy source. The network is made up of energy beams. Energy flows through these beams, and the light-rider always follows the direction of energy. Some beams are red, and the player can flip the direction of the red beams to control the movement of the light-rider. The player moves a controller, and can flip all the beams in a specified row. The light-rider has a limited pool of energy, and each time an energy beam is flipper, energy is depleted. The player can play randomized levels or selected designs.
