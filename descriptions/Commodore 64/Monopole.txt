Monopole is an unofficial game based on the well-known property trading board game Monopoly, for two human players. All 40 squares of the board are mapped as normal, with the properties joined by railways and utilities to buy. Chance and Community Chest cards are as standard, as is Jail and Just Visiting, while the Free Parking jackpot system (which official licenses never feature) and auction-style purchases are both optional. Moves are made by rolling the two simulated dice, then using the transactions menu to offer to buy an opponent's properties, buy houses or hotels, mortgage one of your properties, or check who owns which addresses.
