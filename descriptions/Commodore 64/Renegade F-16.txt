Renegade F-16 is a text-based strategy game for the Commodore 64. The pilot of an F-16 fighter armed with a nuclear weapon flying out of Kennedy air force base has decided to bomb a major American city. The pilot is given a target and fail safe code at the beginning of each mission. The player is given a list of possible targets to bomb, as well as the location of United States defense complexes. The goal is to avoid air defenses and reach the target city or another major American city and reduce it to rubble. Each command requires a period of time. The player can input course and altitude changes for their plane, and can request a status report demonstrating their altitude and direction at any time. The player can request a radar report and search for nearby defensive complexes at any time. The player can conduct evasive action to avoid American interceptors, and can launch ECMs to avoid incoming missiles. The F-16 is armed with a limited number of Phoenix missiles to destroy intercepting aircraft. As the player reached their location they can arm and drop their nuclear warhead.
