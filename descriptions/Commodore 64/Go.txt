Go is a computer implementation of the classic board game. Played on a 19 x 19 grid, it allows for 2-player competitive or 1-player versus computer play. Players take turns placing either a black or a white marker on the screen, with the goal to capture the opponent's piece by surrounding it in the 4 cardinal directions. The winner is the player with the most captured pieces after the board is filled. The player can set a computer handicap which allows them to start with 0 - 9 friendly pieces on the board.
