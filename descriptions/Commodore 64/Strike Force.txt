Strike Force is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a crosshair, and must destroy incoming fast moving enemy vehicles, including: helicopters, planes, and trucks. The player must destroy a certain number of enemies during limited time on each stage to advance to the next level. While combating planes or trucks, they must be quickly destroyed before they can fire on the player. If the player loses 5 lives, it's game over. There is an edit option, where the player can control accuracy, scroll speed, rate of fire, elevation speed, enemy speed, and difficulty.
