Fizzbin is a parody card game released for multiple systems. Based upon the Star Trek episode "A Piece of the Action", Fizzbin is a parody card game designed to have unnecessarily complicated rules that vary upon the time of day, and even the day of the week. Consisting of several pages of convoluted rules, the best hand is the Royal Fizzbin, which consists of a king and a two (or a queen and a four at night), and any of two pairs of aces, jacks, or sevens. The next best hand is the Full Fizzbin, the Three-Quarters Fizzbin, and the Half-Fizzbin, which consists of any pair of jacks, sevens, or aces. Any three or four of a kind is known as the Shronk, and means the player automatically loses.
