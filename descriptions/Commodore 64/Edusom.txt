Edusom is a Dutch educational program that aims to teach children aged 6 - 9 years old to add and subtract. Before the game starts you will be asked what you want to practice with. Then you have to choose how many sums you want. This can be 5 to 25 sums. Once that's done,  all you have to do is choose from 5 difficulty levels from easy to hard. The game then starts with sums like "31 - 9" dropping from the top of the screen. If you answered correctly within the time limit, you'll be encouraged by a round, smiling figure who eats the question and answer. Give a wrong answer and you will be confronted with an angry round figure, who then pushes everything away from the screen. You can then try again. If you answered  incorrectly again, you will get the correct answer. If the time runs out, it is not only counted as a wrong answer, but you are not allowed to try again. You then have to answer the following sum.
