BBC Ask the Family is the computer version of the popular TV quiz show, Ask the Family. The idea of the show was that two families consisting of a Father, Mother and two teenage children, answered general knowledge questions. When a question was asked the first family to buzz answered the question. If correct, points were awarded. If the answer was wrong then the other family answered the question. After 30 mins the family with the most points won. The computer version followed the same formula with two teams doing battle over a 30 minute period.
