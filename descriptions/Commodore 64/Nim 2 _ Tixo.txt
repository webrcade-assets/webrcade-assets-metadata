Tixo Nim 2 is a compilation of two puzzle games. Tixo is a game taking place on a 22x22 board. One of the players starts by placing a token on the board, in the top row or the rightmost column. The players take turns; during a turn a player can choose to move the token to the left, diagonally bottom-left, or down, by any amount of squares. The winner is the first player to reach the bottom-left square of the board. Nim 2 is an adaptation of the game Nim. There are two groups of tokens, with a random number of tokens in each. The players take turns; during a turn, a player can choose one of the groups, or both, and take any number of tokens. The winner is the player who makes the last move, picking up the last token.
