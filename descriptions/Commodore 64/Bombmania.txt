Bombmania is a mixture of Bomber Man and Pac-Man. The player's task is to gather all the stars on the board. The mission is complicated by hostile Frix race monsters and various stones blocking an access to certain places. The player may use bombs scattered around the maze to kill the enemies and destroy the walls, although the bombs must be used with extra caution, as destroying the star means a loss of life. There are a few types of walls, some of them falling apart after one blast, the other requires more explosions. The game features 123 levels all together.
