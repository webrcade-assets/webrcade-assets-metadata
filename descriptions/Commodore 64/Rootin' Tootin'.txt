Rootin' Tootin' is a musical instrument themed game similar to Pac-Man. You play as a tuba that moves about a maze of vertical and horizontal staves collecting musical notes. In pursuit is the rest of the orchestra, which may consist of modified versions of guitars, cymbals, triangles and pianos. There are cymbombs which occasionally drop additional notes, triens which drop deadly pauses, madphones which shoot sonic blasts and pianahs which relentlessly chase you and are not confined to the staves. But you are not defenseless against this musical menagerie. As you collect a musical note, it shoots away from you and will knock out any instruments in its flight path. You also have the ability to turn insubstantial for a couple of seconds, during which time you cannot pick up notes but you also cannot be hurt by the other instruments. During play, bonuses will sometimes appear. These can temporarily turn all enemy instruments into stationary treble clefs, which can be collected for bonus points. Once all of the notes in the maze have been collected, a new level with a different maze layout starts.
