Your name is Don Ferrari - tough cop. In the hope of boosting his re-election chances, the Mayor of Miami has set you a task. Aboard a souped-up F40 you have 48 hours to rid the city of 5 most notorious crime lords (4 in Commodore 64 version), by any means necessary. Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars driven by criminals and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. When all red cars are destroyed, the crime lord that will appear in a yellow car must be destroyed too so the exit from current level will open. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time (not present in Commodore 64 version). You can use a map of the city to help you find your targets. Amiga version supports 1-2 players, whereas Commodore 64/ZX Spectrum version is 1 player only.
