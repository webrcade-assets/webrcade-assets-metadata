Hollywood Poker Pro is a strip poker game and the successor of Hollywood Poker. The poker variant of choice is Draw Poker. The gameplay is similar to most other games of this kind: the player chooses one of four girls and plays poker against her. If he runs out of money, the game is lost - if she runs out of money, she loses a part of her clothes. If she is successful, she can buy back a part of her wardrobe. The AI adapts to the player's style, but this is only true within the same match. The goal is to strip the girl naked. The Amiga and C64 version allow to zoom into the photographs.
