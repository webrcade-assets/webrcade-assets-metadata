You are in your car in the traffic jam in Helsinki, and you have one flat tyre. You must get as far as possible, accelerating slowly, but the flat tyre makes your car go to the left, so you must always compensate in order to stay in the correct lane. The outermost lane is the slowest, and you are advised only to go the left when you've gained enough speed not to be run into from behind. When you're at risk of running into slower cars, it's time to go left again. The minimal graphics and sound of Helsingfors can be explained by the fact that it is only 512 bytes big, ending up in the 14th place in the 512b category of the 2001 minigame coding contest.
