2 Players control 8 little aliens each to battle in several single screen arenas. There is no plot to the game, it just is quick 2 player action.Gameplay is simple, each player has 8 aliens, but only one is controlled at any given time. Which one is controlled can be switched by pressing the joystick button. Then the aliens are cycled through one by one. The movement is on a fixed grid and 4-directional. Adjacent aliens either hurt each other or heal each other, depending on whether they are enemies or friends. Slain aliens leave corpses for a while. The hurt/heal effect is 8-directional, so you have to keep your diagonals protected as well. Whoever kills all enemy aliens first wins. There are 7 different arenas to choose from and the game also has an AI mode for when no human opponent is available.
