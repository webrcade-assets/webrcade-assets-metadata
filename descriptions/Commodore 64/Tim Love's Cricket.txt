Time to dig out those whites and pads and have a game of cricket. You have the chance here to play a sixty over game against a friend or the computer. You can choose your own team but if you don't fancy it then England or the Rest of the World are your two choices. If you win the toss you can choose whether to bowl or bat first. Another option is your skill level, Test, County or Village. If you choose to bowl first you can choose from six bowlers who are fast, medium or spin. The game is viewed behind the bowler and umpire at a elevated angle. As the bowler is running towards the crease, the speed, direction and pitch of the ball can be controlled. The spin and swing can be controlled as well for the spin or medium bowler. After the ball is released the screens switches and you can now see the front view of the batsman at a elevated angle. The batsman can control the angle and height of the bat as well as his position on the crease. If the ball is hit or missed without hitting the stumps or a LBW, the view switches to a top down view of the pitch showing the position of all the fielders. Here the batsman can decide to run or the nearest fielder to the ball can be controlled.
