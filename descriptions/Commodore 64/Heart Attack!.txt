Heart Attack! is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player tries to gather all the diamonds in a randomly generated maze, while avoiding the guard. The guard will always turn right at an intersection. Every 8 mazes the player is awarded an additional man, and the guard moves faster. There are 2 possible gameplay options: allowing for invisible diamonds, or allowing the guard to follow the player's trail once discovered. The player starts with 3 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.
