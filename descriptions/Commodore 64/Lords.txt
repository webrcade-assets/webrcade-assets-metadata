Lords is a 1-player strategy game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a god-like figure that looks down upon their populace, and helps guide them to victory against another group. The game can be played on forest or desert terrain on a large scrolling map, with the the competing groups starting on opposites ends of the map. The player can give instructions to their populace, who builds houses and castles. The player can also cast magic disasters upon the enemy nation, including: lightning bolts, poison, decay, and changes in terrain. The power to use these powers builds over time, and the player will become temporarily powerless after using larger disasters.
