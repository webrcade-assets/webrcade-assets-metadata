Familiada is a puzzle-board game for two players, based on the TV show. The player's task is to guess six answers to a question, with the possibility of making two mistakes. Third mistake passes the question to the other player. Every correct answer is scored. The winner of more points wins the turn. The round starts with a duel who first presses the button and gives a correct answer. Reaching the final stage requires gaining 300 points. The final stage has two rounds, where two team members answer six questions and must reach 200 points all together to win the main prize.
