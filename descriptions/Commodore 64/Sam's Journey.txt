There is an overworld map where the player can choose to go into the actual levels. The level are large and scroll in 8 directions. Sam collects gems, jump on enemies and also pick up, carry and throw items. Find the flashing door at the end of each level to finish the level and exit back to the map. During the level Sam must collect gems, coins and trophies. Collect all items to 100% complete the level. The game features game-play elements from various other games such as underwater sections, checkpoint flags, trampolines, transporter cannons, platforms moving on rails and end bosses. There are colored switches which turn blocks on or off. There are secret passages in the levels which only appear when Sam walks into them. Sam can collect power-ups in the form of outfits, each giving him different abilities. The 6 different power-up outfits are a blue shirt for pirate (sword attack), green shirt for sports (aim throw), yellow shirt for astronaut (jet pack), red shirt for vampire (temporarily turn into a flying bat), purple shirt for disco (air float), black shirt for ninja (wall jump).
