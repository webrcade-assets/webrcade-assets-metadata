Hanoi allows the player to play the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle on the computer. The player is tasked with moving a tower from one place to another. The tower is made of a number of rings (players can choose three up to seven rings) with different sizes. Rings can never be placed on top of smaller rings and only one ring can be moved at a time. There are three slots where rings can be placed, the original location, the desired new location and an additional slot to aid the player. The Commodore 64 version features color graphics.
