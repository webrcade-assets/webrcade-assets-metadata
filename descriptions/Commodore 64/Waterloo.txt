Waterloo is a 2-player strategy game for the Commodore 64. In this historically accurate simulation of the Battle of Waterloo, players take on the roles of the British and French troops.  The player can either turn Napoleon's crushing defeat into a glorious French victory, or once again see Wellington prove the superiority of the English. During each turn, the players' units provide scouting reports on the local terrain.  Each turn, the units' strength, morale, and position are displayed.  Cavalry, artillery, and infantry must be individually positioned and utilized.  Positions are shown on a map of Southern Belgium.  As units come in contact, the computer computes battle results.
