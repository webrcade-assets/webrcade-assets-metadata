Looney Balloon is a side view single screen game where you have to control a balloon from it's starting position and navigate it through a path to land on a landing-pad while collecting all the objects on screen over various levels. The balloon will sway at all times and gravity pulls it down so you must keep the balloon up while moving it around the screen. Each screen must be completed within a time limit and the walls cannot be touched or you lose one of five lives if you run out of time or touch the walls. There are five skill levels (Novice, Pilot, Instructor, Test pilot and Kamikaze) with a higher skill level meaning the balloon sways and falls faster.
