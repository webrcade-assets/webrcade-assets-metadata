Koekoek - Koekoek is a Dutch educational game designed to teach multiplication tables from 0 to 10. The player must free the cuckoo in the clock. This is by ensuring that the weight of the clock does not end up on the stack of blocks. The player must push it away in time. They have one computer hour for this. Within that time, a table sum must first be answered. To get to the blocks, the player must go through a maze. Ghosts walk in the maze, blocking their way. If the player comes into contact with a ghost, they must return to the beginning of the maze. If the available time runs out, another sum must be answered before the player can move further in the maze. Before the game can start, a choice must be made from different levels, which determine the playing time within which the weight of the clock decreases. The assignments consist of: sums from a self-determined table or sums from the tables 0 to 10. There is also the choice whether they want to see with or without the examples of the tables during the assignments.
