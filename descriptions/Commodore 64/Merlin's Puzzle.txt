Merlin's Puzzle is a single screen puzzle game viewed from an isometric perspective as you control Dexter, Merlin's assistant, in your attempt to turn all the red cubes into yellow over various screens. You move around the cubes and press the fire button when you want to change colour, and it also changes cubes around it. You are also able to change a cube back from yellow to red which also changes the colour of the cubes around it. Once all the cubes have been turned to yellow then you move to the next screen, but there are now spheres that move around and will make you lose one of six lives if touched. Falling off the cubes into space also loses a life. Before the start of the game, you can select the difficulty between Beginner, Advanced or Expert.
