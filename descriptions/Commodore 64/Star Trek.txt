Star Trek is a variation on the famous mainframe game Star Trek. You play as a cadet using a simulator at Starfleet Academy Earth Station 4. There are three training mission scenarios (difficulty levels?) to select from- Klingon Invasion, Galactic War and The Final Frontier. Gameplay switches between four screens to control the USS Enterprise, find targets, contact planets etc. Full instructions are included in the game but only a basic summary of the controls is listed on the inlay of the cassette tape.
