Bubble Burst is a 1 - 2 player educational game for the Commodore 64. Stop the Zeboingers from bursting all the bubbles in Soapie's bathtub. The player controls a target, and must shoot bubbles at bird-like Zeboingers as they fly towards the bubblebath. If the Zeboingers reach the bubbles, the bubbles pop, and the bath gets less bubbly. The player has limited bubble juice each round, after which they can no longer defend themselves. The Zeboingers can open the window or turn on the shower, which further reduces bubbles. Each game, the player can choose to start on round 1 or 11.
