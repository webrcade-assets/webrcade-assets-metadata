Pyramid Puzzler is a 1 - 2 player game designed to teach multiplication. Two players attempt to reach the top of a pyramid by correctly answering multiplication questions. There are 3 levels of question difficulty., and each player gets 10 seconds to correctly answer a question. If they are successful, they get to move 1 position. If they answer incorrectly, their opponent gets to move 2 positions. If two players land on the same position, the player who was there first gets a chance to answer another question. If they are correct, their opponent is bounced backwards, otherwise they are bumped backwards.
