Masters of Time is an educational quiz game for multiple systems. All of Earth's history has been lost. You are the pilot of a time machine, and must travel through time faster than the speed of light. Your mission is to reach and record past events on Earth. The player moves on a 3-dimensional playing field, and must locate various time holograms, each of which contains an important historical fact. As the player explores this field, they are attacked by timeguards and timebombs which sap their energy. When the player's energy runs low, they must enter the intertimelevel to arrive back at the present date. Upon arriving to the present date, the player must correctly remember the facts they previously received. Completing this task, the player's energy is refilled, and they go out in search of more historical facts.
