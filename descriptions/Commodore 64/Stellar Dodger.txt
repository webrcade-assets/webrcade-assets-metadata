Stellar Dodger is a variant of Lunar Rescue where you control a ship that is seen docked to the mothership that endlessly goes left and right across the screen. When the fire button is pressed, the ship is ejected and makes it way to the supply dumps on the bottom of the screen, avoiding the asteroid belt along the way. You must then make your way back to the mothership, avoiding the asteroids again. This time you can shoot them to clear more of a path, and you can also use your thrusters if you want to slow down. Be aware, though, that you have a limited amount of fuel that depletes as you go down, and depletes more when the thrusters are used. If you run out of fuel, make contact with any asteroids or the mothership, or miss the supply dumps, you lose one life. The game ends if you lose all of them.
