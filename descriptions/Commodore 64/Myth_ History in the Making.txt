Depending what machine the player is using, the game welcomes him/her with a different story. In the 8-bit version of this platform game the player controls a teenage boy from the 20th century (featured on a box cover) who falls through a tear in the space-time continuum and is transported to the "Time of Legends." There he is rescued by a high priestess who informs him that their world is under attack from Dameron - the Dark Angel of Time who must be destroyed. When he succeeds he will be sent back home. The 16-bit machines were presented with a bit different scenario deeply etched into mythology (check a box cover). The main character is a mystical warrior - Ankalagan - who lives in the year 63AD and uses the powers of Stonehenge to travel in time and combat evil throughout the ages. Apart from the story and slight graphics changes, the rest remains the same. Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more. Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons. In the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level that require a different approach and weapons in defeating them. Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.
