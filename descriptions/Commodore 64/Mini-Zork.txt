Mini-Zork was an attempt by Infocom to create a scaled-down cassette-tape version of Zork: The Great Underground Empire that could be fully-contained with the severely-limited RAM of early-80s 8-bit personal computers that only have a cassette-tape drive for their external storage. Although this project may have originally been intended for a British-manufactured personal computer (such as the Amstrad CPC464 that was released in 1984), the only widely-known release of Mini-Zork is a Zzap!64 Megatape (Commodore software collection) that was sold in the UK for Â£9.99 in 1989 (and perhaps as early as 1988), and then bundled with a 1990 Zzap!64 magazine issue as a freebie. There are rumors that other commercial distributions may have occurred, but the scant historical evidence that's available on the Internet suggests that Mini-Zork was probably only ever (officially) distributed as a free demo. Nevertheless, Mini-Zork has the exalted distinction of being the only Infocom game to have ever been released on a cassette tape (rather than a floppy disk).
