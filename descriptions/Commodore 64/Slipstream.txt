Slipstream is a chase-view shoot 'em up game with 3D polygonal graphics. You have to catch the foes in your targeting box, which then locks onto it, and a missile is automatically fired from your ship. There are two ways to control the action. You can move either the targeting box or your ship. On the first joystick port, the directions move the targeting box (your ship slowly follows the movement of it), and when the fire button is held down, you can directly move your ship instead. On the second joystick port, this is reversed. Both joystick ports can be used simultaneously, for better controls.
