A German advergame published by the Sparkasse a credit institute using characters from the KNAX comics. These are some kind of mascots and the magazines are given for free as they are used to rise awareness of the Sparkasse especially by their future customers. The comics usually deal with the struggle between the residents of the village Knax (the good ones) and their opponents located in castle Fetzenstein (the bad ones) who are usually trying to steal the villagers money. In this game the player can select between Didi and Dodo which are basically the main protagonists of the comics. The goal is to collect all the coins on a 6x6 squares playfield. To make it more difficult the player is chased by one of five possible members from castle Fetzenstein. It is possibly to drop up to five traps per level which slow the opponent down while the traps left at the end of a level award the player bonus points. The remaining time of the time limit does the same. In later levels there are special squares which can only be crossed for a few times or slow the player down for example. Although the opponent is faster then the protagonist only he can leave the playfield to appaer on the opposite side much like in Pac-Man. The game features a Highscore list.
