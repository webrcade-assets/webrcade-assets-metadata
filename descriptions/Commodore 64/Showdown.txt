Showdown is a gunfighter duel in the style of Gun Fight from 1975. Two cowboys are trying to shoot each other down from both sides of a single screen for no other apparent reason than that they are cowboys. Players can go against each other or the computer. They can hide behind and shoot up scenery, including boxes with explosives, and pick up ammo or load manually, and passing wagons on the road may block the view. The first to gun down the opponent five times wins.
