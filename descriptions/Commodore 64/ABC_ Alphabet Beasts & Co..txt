Alphabet Beasts & Co. is an educational game for children that teaches them about spelling and numbers. The game is divided into three sections. The first part involves pressing a letter on the keyboard. Doing this will bring up a scene that includes something or someone beginning with that letter. Below this is information describing the scene. The word in uppercase letters is what is in that scene. Pressing the letter again will cause the game to draw it bigger over three lines. Pressing a number takes children to the numbers section. Whatever number that is pressed will be printed in big letters on the right side of the screen. Like the first section, pressing the number again causes the game to print the number over three lines. Above this area is a blank picture, and when a number is pressed, a dragon will appear from the right side and flame the picture, causing the picture to reveal a picture with something resembling the number, and the dragon will be duplicated a number of times next to the picture depending on what number the child presses on the keyboard (unless they pressed the number '0'). Pressing the [Space] bar allows children to play “Creature Features”. This involves them using the joystick to cycle through different heads, bodies, and legs (one at a time) then pressing [Return] to make their selection. Once all these features have been selected, the character they just made will appear in a random scene. After a few moments, they can repeat the process.
