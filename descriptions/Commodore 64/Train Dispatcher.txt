Train Dispatcher is a simulation of a dispatcher controlling railroad operations over a 150-mile territory. The player maneuvers up to 12 trains in the course of an 8-hour shift by adjusting train switches and signals without directly controlling any of the trains. The player needs to make sure that the trains get to where they need to go in the allotted time (without any crashes).
