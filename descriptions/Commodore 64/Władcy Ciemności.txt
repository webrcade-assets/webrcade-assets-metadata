Władcy Ciemności (Lords of the Darkness) follows the plot of Klątwa. After lifting the curse you've become the ruler, but the twists of fate and intrigues soon forced you to abdicate and emigrate your country. After traveling many lands you found yourself in a realm inhabited by poor and miserable people. You've sworn to find the source of evil troubling them. The game is a flip-screen, menu-driven, fantasy themed adventure. Gone is the animated character from the previous game. The riddles are mostly inventory based.
