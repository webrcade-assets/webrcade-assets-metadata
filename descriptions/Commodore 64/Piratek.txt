Piratek is a text based adventure game. As a pirate wanted by the authorities, the player travels the sea, fighting the ships and visiting cities. The ship is described by three coefficients: cargo, resistance, and speed. Resistance and speed are factors that determine the outcome of duels with other ships, cargo is intended for storing goods and cannons. In the city, the player can sell goods and cannons and upgrade the ship (additional sails, hull enlargement, hull reinforcement) by paying gold. Upgrades affect ship stats. When leaving the city, the captain chooses one of the four nearest cities as the destination for his further journey.
