Race Formula-1 in several tracks while trying to beat a computer, or human opponent.  Pay attention to your fuel and tires: It will be necessary to drive into a pitstop to swap them out and refuel.  Tire damage is indicated by their colour; they start off black and become lighter as they take damage.  Once they have turned white a collision will send the car off the track. Six different tracks are available to race on including Brands Hatch and Vallelunga. Tracks can be played singly, or all together in a Grand Prix contest. When playing the Grand Prix this is scored in the same way as the real contest. Players can select how many laps they want to race and 3 different skill levels.
