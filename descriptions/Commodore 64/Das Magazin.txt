Das Magazin is a managerial simulation in which the player responsible for a monthly computer magazine. Each month a sales ranking is calculated and the goal is to achieve a good place. Depending on the ranking a certain amount of points is awarded and if the quota is failed after a year, the player gets fired. In turn a successful year may result in a bigger budget. The gameplay is completely menu based and consists of changing setting screws. The most important thing to do is hiring staff (editor in-chief, editors and a foreign correspondent) and buying their working equipment. The magazine concept includes both the content (the covered computers and key subjects) and other aspects (e.g. number of printed issues, the used paper or the price). Of course this also depends on the budget and the staff at hand. Other options are marketing and speculating on the exchange market.
