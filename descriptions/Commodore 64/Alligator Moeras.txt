Alligator Moeras is an arcade game where the player controls a bouncing monkey in a swamp. The goal is to collect as many coconuts as possible. This is done by bouncing the monkey against the nuts that are hanging on the two palm trees. The player can influence the direction of the monkey in mid-air. Using the number keys the monkey can be moved either left or right in various speeds. The monkey will bounce up and down automatically. Each time the monkey hits the swamp floor, this piece of floor will disappear. The next time the monkey will land on this spot, he'll end up below the floor and will be eaten by an alligator. The player has several lives (monkeys) and every time the trees are picked bare, they are refilled (but the floor is never reconstructed).
