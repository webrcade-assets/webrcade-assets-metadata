Omnibus is an adaptation of a Hangman game. Being trapped in a locked room the player must find a password before the time runs out. With time expiring, each mistakenly indicated letter causes the lowering of the ceiling quicker. Guessing the password opens the door to the next level. The player can choose both consonants and vowels.
