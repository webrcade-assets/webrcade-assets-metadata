Halftime Battlin' Bands is a 1 - 2 player game for multiple systems. It's halftime at Jazz Scat Stadium, and the fans are cheering for entertainment. As Drum Major of the number one football band, the Scrimmage Stompers, it's up to you to create a perfect band formation, along with a sizzilin' new march, out on the football field. The player controls the Drum Major on the field. They must move to where the colored note appears on the bottom of the floor. Upon picking up a colored note, the icon turns into a rotating series of 4 music notes. These must be aligned with a part of the design displayed on the field. Players can choose from designs of 4 - 9 lines.
