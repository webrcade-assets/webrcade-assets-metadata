In the game, made with SEUCK (Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit) you, as the pilot of an assault craft, should explore the hostile environment of Aurora, some kind of planet or satellite. Starting in the forest, you should break through different places from the bottom to the top. These places will include forest, snow forest, bridges over rivers, roads, pipe systems, two-level fields, etc. During your perilous travel, robot enemies of different kinds (fixed in positions, flying, driving, hiding, etc.) will try to eliminate you. Your way represents a labyrinth, and different traps are set to eliminate you as well. So you should eliminate your opponents gaining score.
