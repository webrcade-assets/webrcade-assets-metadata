An unlicensed Hunchback clone, this one stays close to its source material, having you make Quasimodo run and jump through a medieval side-scrolling set in order to rescue Esmeralda. Though it's lacking the Tarzan-like rope-swinging and the pursuing soldier who enforces the time limit in other versions, its 25 levels boast an ample set of conventional Hunchbackian threats -- rolling rocks and guards' thrusting pikes to jump over, arrows to duck under, and an exceptional menace relatively unknown in medieval Paris: ominous drops of acid rain. As you proceed you will get to risk them one at a time, and eventually, following the classic Hunchback formula, all together.
