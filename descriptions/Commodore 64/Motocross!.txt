Motocross! is a 1-player racing game for the Commodore 64. The player controls an off-road motorcycle, as they race from a behind perspective through a series of tight turns on a dirt track. The gauge at the top of the screen shows current speed. The player can accelerate, decelerate, and drive to the left or right. If the player hits the edge of the track they take a short period to recover from their crash. There are 6 different modes of game play, which decide between the width of the track, whether shifting is required, and if the player is racing against opponents or doing time trials.
