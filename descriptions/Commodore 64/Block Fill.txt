Block Fill is a simple puzzle game: you're facing an 8x8 playing field made of 64 squares. Some squares are solid, some are empty. Your goal is to make all the squares solid. This is done in a way similar to the famous "Lights Out" game. You move your cursor with the joystick and press "Fire" to invert all the squares in a 2x2 section that your cursor is touching. There are 16 initial setups in total to solve. This game is an entry in the MiniGame Compo 2008.
