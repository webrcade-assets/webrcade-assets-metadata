Long Lance: A Computer Game of Tactical Naval Combat in the South Pacific is a strategic naval simulation of Japanese and American forces in the South Pacific during World War II. Designed for 1 - 2 players, each player controls either the American or Japanese forces. A computer opponent is available for 1-player games. The viewpoint is of the theater naval commander, and the player composes task forces, establishes missions and destinations for those groups, and responds to operational events. The game is text-only, and came with a board and physical pieces to allow the player to keep track of the location of theirs and enemy units. Gameplay includes Savo Island on 9 August 1942, Cape Esperance on 11 October, Guadalcanal on 13 November, Guadalcanal on 14 November, and Tassafaronga on 30 November. Time passes in 20 minute intervals, allowing the player to input new commands for their fleet, but will stop to allow the player to react to enemy movements. Gameplay consists of nighttime battles, and each scenario begins at 1800 and ends at 0600 the next morning. During each gameplay segment, the player sets taskforce management, where the player can combine and split ships from each group to create new groups. The player also sets movement orders for their ships. The player adjusts battle doctrine for each group, including open/close range rules, rules of engagement, and tactical guidance. The player's vessels then follow their commanding officer's directions for a 20 minute interval, at which point they await new orders.
