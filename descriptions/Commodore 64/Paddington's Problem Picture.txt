One morning Paddington's friend Mr. Gruber, left him in charge of his antique shop while he went out to do some shopping. Paddington felt very important as he stood in the doorway waiting for the first customer of the day. Thatâ€™s the start of Paddington's adventure in the antique shop that helps to recognize shapes and colours. Paddington's Problem Picture is an educational game that aims to practice shape and colour skills to the age range of 4 to 6. The program consists of five programs: Match - In this program you must try to match up pieces that fit in the block. Paddington has borrowed a trolley to help him move the pieces. Words - In this program you have to guess the word that describes a particular shape or colour (Set 1), anything related to Paddington (Set 2) or the Spectrum Specials (Set 3) as in PRINT, INK. Each error builds part of a train,  after ten mistakes the train moves away across the screen with the right word. Colours - In this program you have to write down the word that corresponds with the particular shape or colour that appears on the screen. Before starting the game you can choose how much help you need. Sorting - In this program, Paddington must sort shapes and colors into the correct boxes. He holds up a shape and you have to tell him which box the shape or colour should go in. Before starting the game you can choose how many tiles you can help him with. (from 1 to 30) Mosaics - In this program you can make your own mosaics. This can be done by first moving the 'tile mover' to select a shape. Then you dip it into the colour that you want and then place it on the work area of the screen.
