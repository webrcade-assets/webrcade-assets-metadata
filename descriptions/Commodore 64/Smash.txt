Smash is a rather unusual tennis game, in that it is played from a 2D side view and therefore players cannot move sideways: in that respect it bears similarities with the Super Volleyball games. The player can move forwards or backwards as well as jump. When hitting the ball, the controller can be moved to influence the height and strength of the shot, obviously not the trajectory due to the limitations of the view. The camera always follows the ball, therefore the players are not always visible: a mini-map keeps track of the positions of each player and of the ball. Four male and four female players are selectable, each with their own statistics and nationalities. The available game modes are single match and knockout tournament. The number of sets and games per set are customizable in single matches, however they progressively increase as the player advances through the tournament. The Amiga version has a few unique features, such as team matches and a training mode against a ball machine. It also implements a fatigue system that is represented by a stamina bar for each player, which depletes if the player moves too much and may negatively influence the ability to run and the strength of shots.
