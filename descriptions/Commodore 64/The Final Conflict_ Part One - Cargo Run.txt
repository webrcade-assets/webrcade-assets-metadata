The Final Conflict: Part One - Cargo Run is an arcade game in 3 parts for the Commodore 64. In Task 1, the player controls a cargo truck that moves laterally at the bottom of the screen. The player must position themselves underneath cargo boxes as they parachute to the surface. A counter at the right of the screen demonstrates how many cargo boxes remain to collect. The player loses a life if they miss 4 cargo boxes, or if they're hit by bombs dropped by planes that fly across the screen. In Task 2, the player controls a vessel that flies in all directions and fires directly forwards. The player must survive by avoiding or shooting incoming vessels. The player has limited fuel demonstrated at the bottom right of the screen, and can refuel by moving onto fueling vessels that fly intermittently across the screen. The playing area narrows as the task progresses. After the player survives long enough, the player progresses to the next level. In Task 3, the player controls the same vessel, and must maneuver through a number of moving obstacles to reach the bottom of the screen.
