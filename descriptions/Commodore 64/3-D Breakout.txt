3-D Breakout is based on the classic game Breakout where you have to deflect a ball with a paddle and destroy a collection of bricks. Instead of deflecting the ball vertically, this version has you sitting behind the paddle deflecting the ball into the screen to destroy a wall of bricks in the distance. If you let the ball pass the paddle then you lose a life, lose all lives and it's game over.
