Poszukiwacz Skarb√≥w is a puzzle game, where the player must gather designated number of treasures in order to get access to another board. Moving around the maze requires proper pushing of boxes blocking the road, finding keys to closed doors and avoiding traps. The player has a limited amount of oxygen, which is consumed while walking and in greater amounts when moving the boxes. Oxygen may be supplemented by finding a tank.
