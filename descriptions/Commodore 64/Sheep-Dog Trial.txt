Sheep-Dog Trial is a 2-player geometric strategy game. The game is played on an 18 x 11 grid, and each player controls a black or a white sheepdog. Black's sheep pen in the top left of the grid and white's pen in the bottom right. Spread throughout the grid are 6 black and 6 white sheep. The players take turns moving their sheepdog by typing in the coordinates they wish the dog to be moved to. To make a sheep move, the player must position their sheepdog directly beside a sheep, and the sheep will move one square away from the dog. If sheep are aligned in a row, then multiple sheep can be moved each turn. The first player to position all of their lost sheep within the pen wins.
