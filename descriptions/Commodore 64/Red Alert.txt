Gameplay largely comprises of random set-piece situations, with a decision to be made which will influence later situations. The ultimate goal is to break into a secret enemy base, however you start with only Â£1000 and no equipment or assistance. The aim is to gradually obtain these, by negotiating to buy or sell information, weaponry and other items. Money can be gambled at the casino or dog track. Potential employees come to you with a wage demand, and sometimes a specific skill. The police occasionally put you under surveillance, which can cause a need to dump documents.
