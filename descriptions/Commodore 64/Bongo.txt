You are an explorer who is being chased by a red dinosaur in a cavern in this side-view flick-screen platformer as you try to get from the left of a huge cavern and traverse 27 screens to the right. As you move through each screen, you will face various obstacles and all must be avoided and these consist of lava, falling rocks and birds. If you take too long to get past a screen, the dinosaur appears behind you and chases you until you make it across the screen. On each screen also is a treasure and if you collect six in a row without losing a life then you get a bonus. Once you reach the last screen you will have to capture the dinosaur with a cage.
