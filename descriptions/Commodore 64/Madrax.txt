Madrax is a platform game where the player walks and somersaults around a maze, located in Almahagor Kingdom, attempting to collect six Thor idols from a Morador dungeon in order to stop the evil wizard's (Gothan) plans. There are many enemies in the maze. They can be defeated by tossing balls at them or by laying bombs near them, but there's a limited supply of ammo. The character can also switch to a sword to kill foes. The enemies can also be destroyed by touching them, but this decreases the player character's health. It is possible to find powerups with ammo and health. The maze contains many doors, some of which transport the character to another door, but others are traps and hurt the player. The game features some item-collecting: you can find a lamp which allows you to see in dark places, keys to open locked doors and a ladder fragment to repair a broken ladder.
