A long time ago in Langlevia there lived a king known as Wohar I. He was certainly a wise man because through his rule the country had become very prosperous. One day the country was in a real festive frenzy. Grünhilde had given her husband Wohar I three successors at once. A triplet of three boys who were given the names Wakahl, Meihr and Clohar. Wohar was so happy that he immediately had three castles built. Alas, as it would turn out, this moment would be the turning point of fortune for the residents of Langlevia. It soon became apparent that Wohar's three sons possessed some very unpleasant character traits. After Grünhilde's death and Wakahl accidentally killing his father with the tombstone, Meihr took charge. Things now went downhill quickly for Langlevia. To restore the land to its former state, the player must break the curse of the "drie burchten". Het Geheim van de drie burchten is a Dutch text adventure in which only the first letter of the commands needs to be entered. The program will complete the words entered. Such as, "NOORD" (NORTH), "OOST" (EAST), "ZUID" (SOUTH), "WEST", "AANVALLEN" (ATTACK), "START OPNIEUW" (RESTART GAME), "GEBRUIK" (USE), "INVENTARIS" (INVENTORY), "KIJK" (LOOK), "LEG" (DROP) and "PAK" (TAKE). The program was typed from a book. The first chapter is dedicated to the mechanics of an adventure game. Chapter two is about the design of this adventure. Where text or simple pictures are offered in a normal Adventure, the book now offers detailed drawings. These would otherwise require 'long stretches' of program. The third chapter is an overview of all the commands that can be used. Chapter four provides the background information. Chapter five is the listings of what each part of the program does accompanied by a brief explanation. Chapter six provides hints and chapter seven gives the solution. Both are in mirror writing. The last chapter contains the drawings that illustrate the story that corresponds to the numbers in the game.
