Batyskaf is a game that teaches Archimedes' law of excellence. With a supply of 100 kg of air, the player controls the position of the bathyscaphe. The goal is to catch as many fish of a special species as possible. The helmsman of the bathyscaphe has a fish finder and an automatic fisherman at his disposal. The control of the bathyscaphe takes place in conventional time units, counted down in successive orders.
