Bounder is back! Again the player is in control of an tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces... This time the aim is to collect smart bombs to finish the game. The player needs to collect all 16. The player must avoid landing on bad stuff like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an "?" also await: sometimes these are helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and so on) - other times they're traps too.
