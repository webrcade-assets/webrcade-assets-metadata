You control a spaceship whose main task is to wipe out several enemies that include flying saucers, seekers, satellite dishes, and spinners. A radar is at the top of the screen to keep track of movement. Use it to find out how far enemies are from you and match their position so that you can fire as soon as they are meters away from you. Once you killed enough of them, you proceed to the next wave. Lives are lost when you collide with enemies or touch shrapnel. Lose all your lives and the game is over.
