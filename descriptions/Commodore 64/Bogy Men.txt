You are being haunted by Bogymen and the only way to keep them at bay is to keep the lights on but the problem is the meter is running out and so the lights are out and the Bogymen are wandering around. Bogy Men is a single screen platform game where you start in the bottom right of the screen with the meter and you have to climb ladders to get to the top left where a coin is within a time limit. The Bogy Men cannot be seen except for their eyes as they wander around the screen and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. There is enough power in the meter to flash the lights on and off for a brief moment three times to stun the Bogy Men for a few seconds. Once the coin is collected then you have to get back down to the meter and once the meter is reached then the lights come back on and now you can see the Bogy Men as well as a trident. If you collect the trident then you can chase the Bogy men and destroy them and once all have been destroyed then you move to the next level.
