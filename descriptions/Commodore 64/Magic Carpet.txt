In Magic Carpet, Aladdin must venture through three caves in search of the legendary magic lamp, avoiding hazards such as bouncing boulders, deadly portcullises, moving walls, vampire bats, and a treacherous elevator. If Aladdin makes contact with any of these, he falls off his magic carpet and is returned to the start of the cave. Once he has made his way to the third cave, he must find some way to get the lamp, guarded by a huge fire-breathing dragon. Once the lamp is retrieved, the game starts all over again, with Aladdin returning to the first cave in search of another magic lamp.
