Top of the Pops is a 1 - 10 player strategy game for multiple systems. The player takes on the role of a music producer trying to make money. Each player starts with £75,000, and can spend £50,000, £75,000, or £100,000 to produce a song. The player can choose the song title and the artist. The more money spent on a song ensures a better hit. Each week, the player sees how their newest songs are faring on the list of new releases and the top-40 chart, and makes profit based upon their song performance. The top performing producer at the end of the game is the winner.
