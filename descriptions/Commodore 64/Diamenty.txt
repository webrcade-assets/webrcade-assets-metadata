Diamenty is a puzzle-solving game. In each level the player must push around same pattern cubes in order to connect them together. Once connected cubes of same pattern disappear from the board. The left panel shows how many same cubes are present on the board. It is very important to control the number of cubes, as there can't be only one piece left. Cubes may be connected diagonally and horizontally, two or even three simultaneously. The game features 99 levels.
