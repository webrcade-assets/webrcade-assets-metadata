Hareraiser: Finale is the final part in a puzzle game for multiple systems. The player moves through a nightime forest using the direction buttons following a hare.  Each screen has different positions of trees, rocks, a spider, and the moon.  As they follow the hare, they receive clues that are supposed to help them find the real life hidden treasure of a golden hare, which was supposedly hidden somewhere in England.
