Tink!Tonk!: Castle Clobber is an educational game. The Great Gork has stolen all the toys in Tink Tonk Town, and hid them in his treasure chest within his castle. It is up to Tonk to head to the castle and retrieve the toy chest. The player must explore the numerous rooms of the castle to gather keys and items, and with each item the player must solve a mini-game. Items to collect are the light orb to illuminate dark rooms, and the magic box to defeat Gork's guards. If the player is seen by the Great Gork, he is zapped back to town. After retrieving the toy chest, the player must return to town without being caught. Mini-games include: Build Me Exactly: choose the correct head, body, legs, and item to exactly build a robot. Four in a Row: find the four identical keys in a row from a group of similar appearing keys. Odd Keys Out: find the 6 key that are different from a total of sixteen. Pair the Keys: find the groups of 2 identical keys. Who's Next: create the parts for the next robot in the sequence.
