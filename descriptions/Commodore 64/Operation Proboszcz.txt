Operation Proboszcz is a first person shooter. The game takes place on a single screen location. The player's task is to track down and kill all the priests. A new priest appears every few seconds in a various window of the church. The player moves viewfinder to the right, left, up or down and performs shoot. The game offers two difficulty levels - for standard players and radical Catholics. The second one causes viewfinder to move in unpredictable ways, as if the player was drunk.
