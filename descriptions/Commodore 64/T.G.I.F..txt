T.G.I.F. (abbreviation for "Thank God It's Friday") is a board\party video game for 1-4 players. If chosen 1 player the computer (called "Atari") will play against you. Goal of the game is to get a certain amount of cash. You can choose between 10000$ - 90000$ USD as a set goal and you can get cash by winning the lottery, spend your money in investments and payday checks, withdrawal from the bank, or tax refunds. The "board" has all the 7 days of the week, each with its own certain bonuses or penalties, depending on the day: Monday: You lose money due to a certain circumstance. Either because you had to pay the doctor, or because you bought new clothes.Tuesday: Lottery day. Find out if any of the numbers you have will grant you money. For getting numbers you have to buy lottery tickets first.Wednesday: Either you get a bonus to your payday check, a tax refund, or withdraw money from the bank.Thursday: ??? = That means Thursday is "Random Day". Either you go to the lottery, have a treasure hunt, or have an investment opportunity.Friday: The reason why the game is called "T.G.I.F.". Payday. Get your payday check! Starts at 1000$ , but you can get more money from Wednesday's payday check bonus.Saturday: Time to go for a treasure hunt! Dig on the map to find the treasure, arrows will help you. If you don't find the treasure a certain amount of moves you will have to pay money.Sunday: Lazy Day. You do nothing and just relax. Sometimes a buyer for your investment will come or you can do a treasure hunt. There is also the field "investment", where you invest money to buy a car, boat, or land. After a time, or if you hit Sunday or Thursday, a buyer will come and offer you a higher sum of money than the one you paid. If you are in the red you have to pay a loan to continue.
