Adults Only is a 2-10 player adult themed board game for the Commodore 64. Each player takes turns rolling 2 dice to advance clockwise around a board. Each player is named, and are male or female. The player is supposed to take the number of drinks displayed on the screen after each move. Certain squares ask the player to either remove a piece of clothing, perform an action with another player, or take additional drinks. If a player rolls a double, the mugger moves around the board clockwise, and the first player they encounter will lose a piece of clothing. The current clothing status of each player is displayed on the screen. The last player left wearing clothes is the winner.
