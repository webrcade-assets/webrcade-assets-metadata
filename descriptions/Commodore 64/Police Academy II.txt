Police Academy II is the sequel to Police Academy. The aim of the game is to make the player an accomplished police officer. The training consists of various lessons; Composing a weapon - Assemble a weapon as quickly as possible with the correct parts. The weapons in the green boxes serve as an example; in the white box the player can create his own weapon. If the weapon is constructed correctly, the player receives extra bullets. A poorly assembled weapon will provide fewer bullets for the next screen. A weapon part (barrel, magazine and stock) can be picked up above the white surface using the fire button or the space bar. Shooting range - Shoot as many bad guys as quickly as possible. This allows the player to increase their status. Take too long and they will shoot back and the energy bar will go down. But be careful. The status decreases when civilians are shot. On the left of the screen it says which lesson the player is currently in, the score, the number of bullets they have and the bonuses. At the bottom left of the screen there are three bars that indicate time (T), energy (E) and status (S). If either of these two bars is consumed, the game will be over. At the top appears a target that gives extra bullets when shot. At the bottom of the screen some vehicles will appear at full speed. Shooting down criminals' cars earns bonus points, but if passing police cars are hit, the player's status will decrease significantly. Catching bullets - Catch as many falling bullets as possible that can be used in the next screen. Try to avoid the purple bullets or this lesson will be over. The street - Here the characters are no longer frozen, but alive. Again, shoot as many bad guys as quickly as possible who are among the passers-by. This time, seemingly innocent civilians may turn out to be criminals in disguise. They suddenly can pull out a weapon or raise their hands in surrender.
