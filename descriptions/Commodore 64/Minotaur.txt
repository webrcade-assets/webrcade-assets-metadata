Minotaur is a labyrinth game. The player can choose from 5 visual maze types and 5 character icons. Each maze is created based on the coefficients of the horizontal (5-19) and vertical (5-12) lines and is always different from each other. The game features a one or two player mode. In the two-player mode, there is an alternating and opposing mode. In the first mode, players alternately complete another maze; in the second mode, players complete the same maze - the shorter time score wins.
