You are escorting an interplanetary supply transport in a space-ship equipped with a pulse laser. Hostile alien vessels, belonging to the so-called Triad, are amassing nearby waiting to attack. It is your task to destroy the Triad formation, and then you must make a path through a meteor field, so that the cargo can arrive safely at its destination. Triad plays like a 3D version of Galaxian, where you control the positioning of the gun sight and when to fire your laser. In the first screen, aliens of the Triad assemble in the distance, and you must shoot at them before they get too close or launch antimatter fields. Each hit by an enemy may deplete your shield energy. After the aliens have been dispatched, the second screen displays incoming meteors which must also be shot before striking your ship's shield. After both screens have been completed, you are shown a cut-scene of the transport arriving at the target planet, and you qualify for the next level of difficulty which is much like the earlier levels. Each game starts with three lives, which may be lost when your shield energy reaches zero. After each life lost, you are required to start the screen you are on from the beginning.
