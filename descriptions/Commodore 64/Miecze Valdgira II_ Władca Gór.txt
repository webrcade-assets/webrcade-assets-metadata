Miecze Valdgira II: Władca Gór is an action-adventure game. This time king Aldir must defeat Bloody Zenon, that uses Cyclops eye to terrorize the surrounding area. Aldir must wander the surrounding forest and underground labyrinth, collecting one-use items along the way and using them in the right places, mostly to open underground passages. Each location is inhabited by hostile creatures. Contact with the creatures for longer than two seconds means instant death. The best way to circumvent the enemy is jumping over or passing under them.
