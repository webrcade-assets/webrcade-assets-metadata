Alvin the Android features three text adventures on one disk: Junkyard 1 :You are Dr. Alvin Nemesis, one of the co-authors of the Android Bill of Rights. Unfortunately not every one agrees with you. You have been poisoned and dumped in the Junkyard. You have a limited amount of time to build an android body for yourself and transfer your consciousness into it. Junkyard 2 :You completed the first stage, but still have to escape the Junkyard. With only eight hours before the last transport leaves, you must make your way past numerous traps set by the Anti-Android Terrorists. Junkyard 3 :The final stage is the hardest. With only four hours before lift off, you are still beset by the Anti-Android Terrorists. If you can't escape, then the Android Rights Movement is doomed.
