Sir Ababol is a 2D platform game about Sir Ababol, a young crusader from Manchester City who lives in the 11th century. He witnesses the courage of St. George from Capadocia against the infidels and stumbles over a rock, falling into the Alcoraz River that carries him to the Monegros' Desert. When he wakes up he realizes he has lost his sword. He asks a farmer about the sword and is directed to a land full of ababol flowers. He is confused, but believes the red flowers may be tied to recovering his sword and decides to collect them, hoping to then continue his journey to Jerusalem. The game consists of a single, large level that comprises many single-screen rooms. The player can explore freely as the rooms are linked horizontally and vertically. To win the game 25 red flowers have to be collected in any order and then the game is won right away. Sir Ababol can move around and jump. He has no means to attack enemies and creatures and has to avoid them. Water is also a hazard. Sometimes keys need to be picked up to open doors to continue to a next section. Sir Ababol has a large amount of health with a single life. He can sustain more than one hundred hits, but life is drained quickly when in water or in an enemy's path. Health also counts down over time, acting as a time limit to complete the game. Some screens contain chicken to restore some health. The NES and Amiga versions keep the original level lay-out, but with a few changes to the gameplay. The entire level is turned into a side-scrolling environment. Sir Ababol only has nine lives, but he is able to jump on top of enemies to kill them.
