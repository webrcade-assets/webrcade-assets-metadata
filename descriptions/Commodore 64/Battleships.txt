Battleships is a fairly straight forward conversion of the classic pen and paper game. It allows the player to play the game against the computer. Ships may be placed horizontally, vertically and diagonally on a grid and the player and the computer take turns to fire at the other player's grid. If it's a hit the player is informed. All tiles that a ship occupies must be hit, before a ship is sunk. The first player to sink all the other's ships wins. The player may opt to place his ships manually or have them placed automatically.
