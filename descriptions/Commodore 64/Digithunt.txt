Digithunt is the first home computer implementation of the game Sudoku. It is a number-puzzle game where you have to place missing numbers in the gaps, in such a way that each column, each row, and each 3x3 boxes contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. There are 9 skill levels, 1 easiest and 9 the hardest. On the easiest skill level there are fewer gaps with missing digits, on skill level 9 there are many gaps with missing digits. The score board contains a high score per skill level.
