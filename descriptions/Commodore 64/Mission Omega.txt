Omega is the code name for a mysterious alien craft which has appeared in space, armed with potentially destructive missiles. The task is to reach it, and then disable its four reactors and escape within a hour - this way it can be explored, and its technology exploited, without it firing a missile or falling into enemy hands. The player does this by guiding a robot droid through the corridors and rooms which make up the ship. The player controls the game using an icon system, and the first task is to configure the robot with the weapons and power supply the player feels will be the most effective. Rather than individually directing each move, the player can use the inbuilt map to plot a course for the robot.
