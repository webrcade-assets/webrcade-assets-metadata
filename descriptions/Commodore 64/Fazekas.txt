Fazekas is a Hungarian text adventure game. You play as a student of the Fazekas Mih√°ly high school. Your mission is to replace your lackluster physics test with a better one, before the original gets corrected by the teacher. You also have to manage your classes of the day, or skip them. Your surroundings are depicted with a few simple images made of ASCII characters. Progress can be saved. A few Hungarian characters are supported, but only those that are present in the Swedish alphabet too.
