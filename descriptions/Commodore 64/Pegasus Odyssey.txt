Pegasus Odyssey is a 2-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. Two pegasi must defend their mountain from malicious bats. Each player controls a pegasus that can fly by flapping its wings, and moves left and right. Bats emerge from the cave at the top right of the screen and begin to rapidly fly about the screen. When a pegasus lands atop a bat, the bat falls to the ground as an egg. These eggs can then be collected to eliminate the enemy from the screen. If the pegasus is too slow gathering the egg it will rehatch as a new enemy. If the pegasus collides directly into an enemy they lose a life, and a new pegasus emerges from the fire at the bottom right of the screen. The two players are on the screen concurrently, and each player has 3 lives. There are 9 levels of difficulty.
