The Footballer is a football management game where you must get your team from the English Division Four and win Division One while trying to win other trophies. Although there are various options, the options needed to affect your game are limited as you can either pick your team and formation, or deal in the transfer market. Once you are happy with your selections its on to your next game. The match highlights is just text as you watch a clock count from 0 to 90 mins and any goals scored or major incidents will appear. As you watch your match you can see live scores from the other matches in your division.
