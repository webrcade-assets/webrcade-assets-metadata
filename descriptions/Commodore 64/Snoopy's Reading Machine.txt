Snoopy's Reading Machine is an educational game for multiple systems. The player chooses the last 2 letters of a 3-letter word. The player then sees a small picture or animation, and must select the correct first letter to complete the word. There are 3 levels of difficulty. At lower levels of difficulty, the player selects the letter from a list, but on higher levels the player must type the word independently.
