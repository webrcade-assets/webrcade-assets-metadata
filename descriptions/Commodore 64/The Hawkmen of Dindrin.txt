The planet of Dindrin is a windy place. It is also home to a reptilian race that conducts religious worshipping ceremonies by placing valuable polished golden stones on the planet's surface to bask in the sun. You control a hawkman, who wishes to collect these stones, because they give you points. Maneuvering the hawkman can be difficult, due to the constant wind from the left of the screen. Fighting the wind costs you energy, which you should try to keep above zero. Additionally, there are floaters scattered around the screen, a skimmer that traverses the lower regions, and reptilians on the ground, ready to grab you if you get close enough. Contact with any of these is fatal, causing you to lose one of your three hawkmen. In the VIC-20 version of the game, hawkmen are possessed with a prehensile tongue like a hummngbird. And these tongues can be extended using the joystick button to destroy your foes, adding to your score and energy. In the C64 and Atari 8-bit versions of the game, the button seems to activate a shield which prevents you from losing a life when colliding with an enemy, but causes a loss of energy instead. You lose the game if you run out of lives. But if you survive long enough to reach 10,000 points, you win the game.
