In Catcha Troopa you control a boat that goes left and right across water, and your job is to catch paratroopers being ejected from a plane. A shark is patrolling the water, and will eat anyone who dares enter. If a paratrooper manages to hit the water, you have a limited amount of time to rescue them before they are eaten. This can be done by hovering over them and dropping a ladder so they can climb up. Two points are awarded for every paratrooper caught, and a life is lost if they are eaten. Making your job difficult are gusts of winds that blow them across the screen, and you need to predict where they are going to land. The game is over if enough paratroopers are eaten.
