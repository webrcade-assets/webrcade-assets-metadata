New Wild West is a Hungarian-specific text adventure game. The human race has settled on the moon. The circumstances are like the Wild West. The Moon Mafia wants to take your property, and so the adventure begins. The text descriptions about your surroundings are also visualized with simple images. A save-load feature is present. There are some occasional musical cues. The Hungarian character set is supported by the parser.
