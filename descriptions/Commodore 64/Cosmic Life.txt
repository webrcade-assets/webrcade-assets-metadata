Cosmic Life is a 1 - 2 player competitive game based upon the game of Life. Each player places digi-bugs on the screen, that reproduce based upon the rules in Conway's Game of Life. Gameplay is in real-time, and players control a spaceship that can keep placing new bugs on the screen. Storms can strike the spaceship, which temporarily immobilizes them. Games can be timed or unlimited, and players receive points based upon how many digi-bugs they have on the screen at the end of each turn. Players can also practice in a single-player turn-based game.
