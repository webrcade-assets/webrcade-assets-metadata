Operation Anoria is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. It seems an act of interstellar piracy has gone wrong, and the player finds themselves stranded on the surface of a dangerous alien planet.  The player controls a character who can jump vertically and at 45 degree angles with the help of their jetpack, and can fire straight forwards.  The player travels through different rooms, and can take, drop, use, or wear the items they discover.  The player has limited energy, which is drained by contacting enemies, and slowly drains away with time.  Enemies appear rapidly from the edges of the screen, and can be shot or avoided.  Energy can be restored, but the player has a limited number of days to complete their escape.
