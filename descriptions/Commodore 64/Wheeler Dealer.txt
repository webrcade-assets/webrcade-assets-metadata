Wheeler Dealer is a 2 - 16 player strategy game for multiple systems. Each player tries to corner the car manufacturing industry in the United Kingdom by forcing their competitors out of business. To manufacture a car the player must have an engine, gearbox, and tires. Players can form a syndicate at the beginning of the game where 2 player can pool resources and licenses. At the beginning of each game the players bid among themselves for licences to purchase 1 or more of the car components, receiving 50,000 of those parts to start. No player has sufficient starting funds to afford all 3 licenses. Each player must have a license to be able to earn victory. After all licenses are sold, players take turns purchasing parts from their opponents. They can also purchase what ever parts they have a license for from the manufacturer. At any time a player can pull a town card, which shows how many vehicles and for what price a local municipality is willing to purchase. If a player has all 3 parts in sufficient quantity to meet the city's demands then they can make a sale for profit.
