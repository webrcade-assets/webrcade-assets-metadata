Even against all advice, you as a scientist have decided to carry on with an experiment which seems to have gone badly wrong. You have woken up on a beach but the difference is that everything is purple, your surroundings, wildlife and even your clothes. Your task is to explore the island and try to get back home. Magic will be needed and you will encounter a whole host of weird creatures. Land of the Purple Sea is a text adventure with text on the screen describing your location. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings.
