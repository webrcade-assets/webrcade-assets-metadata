A sequel to Gazza's Super Soccer, this soccer game allows to play as several international teams, this time in an overhead horizontally scrolling display (as opposed to the two fixed screen display modes from the first installment). Each team comes with their own difficulty level - for example, the Brazilian team is much stronger and easier to play than the Albanian team. While some features like the power gauge for kicks return from the previous game, Premier League matches and knockout championships are unavailable in this installment. Two human players can play against each other on the same machine, although only one can use a joystick depending on which system they play on.
