Titans is a 1-player sidescrolling arcade game for the Commodore 64. Battle through Ancient Greece atop a pegasus to destroy deadly enemies. Set on a short horizontally looping background, the player controls a pegasus that moves in all directions and fires directly forwards. The player starts with 5 lives, and has limited energy to destroy enemies for each life. There are 10 levels of difficulty with more and more difficult monsters. Higher levels require the destruction of more monsters to complete. If the player takes a single hit they lose a life. After completing a level, the player enters a bonus stage where they try to climb up a pyramid to reach a torch while avoiding or jumping over rolling rocks.
