Forced Encounter is an arcade shoot-em-up. In each level you have a single enemy: a UFO who is trying to capture a biological specimen (you) for their research. You need to shoot the UFO to end the level. However the alien craft has surrounded itself with a moving shield of red and blue walls, and while it is protected can rain down a hail of gas-bombs and a capture net. The bombs may be shot as they fall, but the nets are invulnerable to your bullets, and can only be avoided. Your goal is to shoot through the shield wall, and get the UFO before it gets you. Once you have been hit three times, you become incapacitated and the UFO is able to beam you up to perform unspeakable experiments.
