An unknown alien invasion force has invaded your Galaxy and have ransacked it leaving a trail of destruction through five Colony Structures on their way to Earth to invade and destroy the planet. All communications have been lost to Earth so no warning can be made to save the planet, so someone must fly through the Structures with the message destroying as many alien ships as they can. You have been selected for this mission and you must fly your Cyberwing MK3 Mid-Range Fighter equipped with a forward firing cannon in this top view vertical scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls upwards constantly. As you fly, you must either shoot or avoid the aliens while also avoiding walls and lasers that turn on and off. If you hit any wall, laser or ship then you lose one of three lives but you are also equipped with five Mattersplatters that destroy anything on the screen.
