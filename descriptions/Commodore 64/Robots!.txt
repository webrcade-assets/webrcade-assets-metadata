Robots! is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a character who can move in all directions and fires in the cardinal directions. The player tries to gather all the rubies on the screen while trying to avoid approaching robots and spiders. Robots can be destroyed with laser fire, but spiders are invulnerable. As the robots move, they drop bombs which will destroy the player if touched. When all rubies are collected, the player moves to the next level.
