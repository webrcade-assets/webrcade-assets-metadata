Caveman is an unofficial adaptation of the Grandstand/Tomy/Tandy electronic table-top game. It was written as an exercise in learning 6502 assembler. In this game you are a caveman who needs to steal dinosaur eggs without getting caught. Played on a single screen shown from a side view, the caveman is controlled directly. Eggs regularly appear below on a dinosaur on the right side of the screen. The caveman needs to move right, grab an eggs and bring it back to the cave to score points. Eggs cannot be stolen while the dinosaur is looking. An axe can be thrown to stun it temporarily. The caveman also needs to avoid dino fire. A pterodactyl will also appear attempting to steal eggs from the cave. It can be killed by throwing an axe. Eggs need to be collected before they hatch. There are multiple levels and the game keeps track of the score. Extra lives can be earned at every 2,000 points. There are two difficulty levels. Visually the game recreates the large multi-coloured display recognisable from the Grandstand tabletops.
