Premier II is a football management game based on a sixteen-team English Super League, with seven skill levels. Each squad has eleven starters and one substitute from a squad of sixteen players, defined as defenders, midfielders or attackers, with no specific goalkeeper. Your players are named (based on England stars of the time) but the team is not, conversely your opposition players are not named but have skill and morale ratings, and the teams have a standard formation defined. The player can attempt to sign one player each week - this involves entering the team and player number, and gives three chances to make an accepted offer. Matches are played out on a static screen, with attempts at goal reported throughout, and scores from other games at half time (when the player can use their substitute) and full time. Finances are updated after each match, with the chance to take out and repay loans between matches
