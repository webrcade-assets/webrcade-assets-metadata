Slater Man is a side-scrolling platform game. The goal of the game is to gather all the stars knocked down during the titular hero's careless ride across the galaxy. The game features 40 levels where the player must collect a specified number of stars and reach the end of the level to advance to the next planet before the time runs out. The task is complicated by numerous animals. Contact with them means certain death. The hostile creatures may be killed with unlimited arrows.
