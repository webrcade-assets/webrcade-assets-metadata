Will 'o the Wisp is a satirical take on textual adventure games. In the game the player takes on the role of a poor country boy about to be married to the beautiful Brunhilde. The boy can stay in his shabby shack and watch T.V. or explore the neighboring forest and get inadvertently lost. Since this is satire, there seems to be little to do in the forest except getting more and more hopelessly lost. However, there are some items that can be found and some unique locations and with the right actions the player might be returned to Brunhilde. The game controls like a typical text adventure from around its time, except all the room descriptions are written sarcastically.
