The main goal of this game is to recover the stolen successful slogans of Victoria-Vesta, an insurance company. For each game, one of them was cut into pieces and hidden in rooms in two houses. One of those houses is yours. They are hidden behind the different objects in the rooms. If you find one of the pieces, it will appear at the top left of the screen. Each piece is hidden twice. If you find both pieces twice, this part of the slogan will be remembered and you will receive a bonus. Later, if you have found all parts of the slogan, you must form the slogan in the second part of the game. Looking for the slogans can be dangerous, but with a non-life insurance policy of Victoria-Vesta you run less risk. You can buy some of these insurances with a part of the budget made available for this at the start of the game. The premium will then be deducted from this budget. You can also buy life insurance policies, depending on your playing age, for an increase in your budget. If you want to buy these, or you want more information about an insurance policy, you need to contact your insurance advisor using the telephone in the room. The game ends when your budget falls below 0 or when you turn 110. If your age is low and your budget is high after you have found all slogans, the more time you get to compose the slogan. The game is played with the joystick, but the controls differs per room; If you move the joystick up, you can search, make a call and use the stairs. When the fire button is pressed, you can whistle to the dog, take the baby and move the kitchen stairs. To win information about the insurance or to buy it, you have to press the fire button.
