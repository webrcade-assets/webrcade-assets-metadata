Word Invaders is a typing game for multiple systems. Vaguely based upon Space Invaders, a spaceship begins to print out random words starting at the top left of the screen. When the ship completes a line, the words move down a line and a new line of random words begins to print. As the player types the words they are destroyed from the bottom of the screen. The goal is to destroy all of the words before they reach the bottom of the screen. The player receives a report on errors and typing quality at the end of each round. There are 4 levels of word difficulty and word speed.
