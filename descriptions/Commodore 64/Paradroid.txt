Paradroid is a top view shoot-em-up set aboard eight large space freighters filled with droids. After going through a storm in space, the rays affected the droids and they malfunctioned and killed the crew. You now have to destroy all the droids on the fleet of eight ships. You control an "Influence Device" which can temporarily control other droids and use their weapons to destroy the others. When your power is low or your damage is high, you will need to find a power point to recharge or transfer to another droid, or risk losing your Influence Device. The player can also access computers on each deck which provide information on droids, deck plans and an overall ship plan. Once all of the robots on a level have been defeated the lights are automatically dimmed. The player can then travel to another level using a lift to continue their mission.
