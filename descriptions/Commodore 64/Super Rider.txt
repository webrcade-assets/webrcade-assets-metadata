In this show jumping themed game, the objective is to guide Super Rider successfully through the Firebird Arena obstacle course against the clock. Points are scored by avoiding giant pyramids, clearing yawning ravines and jumping fences. Every time the rider is thrown from the horse, there is a 5 second time penalty.
