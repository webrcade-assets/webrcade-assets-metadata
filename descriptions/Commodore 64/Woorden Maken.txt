Woorden Maken is a Dutch educational game designed to teach more words. This word game can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players, who can each create a word of up to six letters. This can be done by taking turns shooting letters out of the air with a bow and arrow. Before shooting, each player must first hit a target; the closer to the bullseye, the more time to aim when shooting letters. The shooting is over when the target is not hit or the time for aiming runs out. One letter can be shot per shooting session. Now all the letters of the alphabet with values and two characters (Â£ and @ for the C64) without values slowly fall down. The latter can be used for any letter. Each player receives the letter they shot on a letter tray. The letters on this bar may be interchanged. After each shooting turn, a player can hand in their word. The other players then first complete the game round and then hand in their word. The player with the highest number of points (= letter value x number of letters) wins. The computer keeps track of each player's turns and points.
