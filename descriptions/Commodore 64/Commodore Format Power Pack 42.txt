This cover-mounted cassette contains two full Hewson games - Stormlord and its sequel Deliverance, as well as 3 Shoot â€˜Em Up Construction Kit creations by a New Zealander. Alien Smash* is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which you must navigate roads with many gaps, and shoot aliens. There are regular mini-bosses, which break down into chunks as you shoot them. Fire Eagle is another space-themed scrolling shooter. The player travels through narrow caves - contact with the outer walls is fatal. Chrome Bros is an unusual use of SEUCK; a platform game. Our heroes must climb ladders, collect bonus items and face various pre-programmed enemies (largely by avoiding them, as the player has limited ammunition). Levels are horizontally symmetrical, other than the locations of bonus items and the danger from daggers which move horizontally across the screen.
