Doris is a timed puzzle solving game. The goal of the game is to arrange an identical pattern in the second window within a designated time and number of moves. Arranging the pattern requires moving a full row - diagonally or horizontally by one or more fields. Each shifting process deducts one move from the allowed number. The passage of time or the use of all movements ends the game. The game features 99 levels.
