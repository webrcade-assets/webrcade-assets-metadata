Automania is a platform game in which the player must help Wally, who works on a car assembly line, build a series of ten cars. Each car consists of six parts that are distributed all around the stock room and must be collected to be placed in their correct positions on the car at the assembly area. The factory is populated with stuff that will kill Wally on contact, like robots, bouncing tires, and air cooling blades.
