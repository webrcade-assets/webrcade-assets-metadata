Miniature Golf is a 1-player game for the Commodore 64. Played from a top-down perspective, the player angles their shot by rotating a crosshair around the ball. The player then controls the strength of the shot by setting a meter and swinging at the ball. There are a total of 18 holes, and the player can bank off edges and walls. Obstacles include spinners, water traps, and sand traps. The game keeps track of swings for the total 18 holes.
