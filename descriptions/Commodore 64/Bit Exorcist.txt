Bit Exorcist is a 1-player arcade and puzzle game for the Commodore 64. That newly written program ran error free last evening, but in the morning nothing works at all. This certainly had nothing to do with the programmer's skill, but is due to ghosts that haunt the micro chips. The player takes the role of a Bit Exorcist, who drives through the labyrinthine circuit board in a tank-like vehicle and must shoot down ghosts. In tank mode, from a top-down perspective the player has a limited time to shoot all the ghosts wandering the large levels. The tank can rotate and move in the cardinal directions, and fire straight ahead. A small map in the top left of the screen shows ghost location and malfunctioning chips. The game enters a puzzle sequence when encountering a malfunctioning chip. There are 16 rows of a combination of 4 yellow or purple squares which demonstrate starting input, and 16 more rows of desired output. The player moves between rows, and has to modify the 4 colored inputs to match the output by placing chips on the lines. Chips can cross lines, invert signals, duplicate signals, or output depending upon matched input. There are a total of 8 levels of progressively more advanced chips to exorcise.
