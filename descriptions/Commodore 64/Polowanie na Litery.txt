Polowanie na Litery is a simple game, where the player must press the letters on their keyboard corresponding to the ones being dropped by an aircraft that is flying around before the letters hit the city buildings. Each level lasts for a certain indicated time and introduces an additional letter falling from the aircraft. The collapse of the letter on the city means the destruction of 25% of city facilities. Four hits end the game.
