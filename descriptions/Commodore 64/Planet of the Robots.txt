Planet of the Robots is a text-based adventure game for multiple systems. A time warp has suddenly transported you into the future, where a war using neutron bombs and bacteriological warfare has completely wiped out the human race. However, the computers and robots don't know this, and keep going about their business as if nothing has happened. The player starts in a parking lot, with the goal to return back to the present day. The player inputs all actions via VERB NOUN commands, and the player can save or restore a game in progress. The player must explore the ruins of human civilization, in search of a time machine. The player must search through a large abandoned mall, town hall, an old university, a subway station, and other locations to reach their goal. During their adventure, if the player commits any crime, they are captured by the robopolice and put on trial in front of a robotic judge and jury. If the crime is severe enough, they are put to death by electrocution. The player only has a limited number of turns before getting hungry, and if they don't eat they will starve to death.
