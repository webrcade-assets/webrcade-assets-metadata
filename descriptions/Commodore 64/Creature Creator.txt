Creature Creator is a game involving design and animation for multiple systems. The player can create a monster by selecting from a large number of different head, arm, leg, and torso designs. The player can then animate the creature by allowing them to roar, grab, hop, wave, stomp, and turn their head. There is also a game mode, where the player watches an animation of their monster, and then must create the identical animation by setting their creature's movements.
