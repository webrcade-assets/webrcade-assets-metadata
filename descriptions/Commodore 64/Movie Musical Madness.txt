Movie Musical Madness is a 1-player creative game for multiple systems. Featuring the musical band the Jazz Scats, the player creates a music video for the band. The player chooses a band member, and then places a variety of props on the scene. The player can choose from a variety of musical scores to accompany the scene. The player then can move their chosen character throughout the animated scene as music plays. Items, props, and music are chosen from a number of menus represented by dots at the top and bottom of the screen. Movies can be saved and reviewed at a later date.
