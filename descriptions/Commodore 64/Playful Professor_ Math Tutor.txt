Playful Professor: Math Tutor is an educational game that teaches addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There are seven difficulty levels with the first four dealing with whole numbers while the later three involve fractions. The game can be played by one or two players. The game is set in a haunted castle where the players are trapped. The aim is to escape by taking the key from a ghost and move to the door on the bottom floor. The castle is viewed from the side and contains a number of rooms that the players in each turn have to move between. After each move a mysterious wind causes the light of each room to be turned on or off. It is only possible to move to a room that is lit. Before making a move it is necessary to answer a math problem in the tutor portion of the game. If the answer is right the player can keep playing and if not the tutor explains how it can be solved.
