Conquestador: Szenario Generator is an add-on for Spoils of War. It adds a construction set which can be used to create new maps and landscapes. Besides the usual option to hand-build everything, the player may also choose to random-generate parts of the world and tweak it afterwards. Also on the disk are nine scenarios which are modeled after real or fictional landscapes, e.g. North America, Africa of Aventuria. Additionally included is a patch for the main game (applied to copies of the original disks).
