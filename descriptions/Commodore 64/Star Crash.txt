Star Crash is a 1-player space fighting game for the Commodore 64. As captain of a strategic space station patrolling on the fringes of the galaxy, life can be pretty dull. Usually the cryogenic chamber is set to defrost only once every 10 years (in accordance with the recommendations of the United Galaxies Space Health Sub-Committee), but this time the RB-130 onboard computer has detected an alien battle fleet heading towards Federation territory. Played from a first person perspective, the goal is to destroy as many alien vessels as possible before succumbing to their endless fire. The defenses are equipped with a panoramic radar display that divides the space the ship into squares. White dots represent remote projection shields stationed in strategic positions around the craft. Enemy ships phase in and out of the current dimension, and can only be engaged at certain times. Colored squares on the radar represent enemy squadrons, but they can only be visualized while in a white phase. Surrounding the station is a pulsed laser protective shield that neutralizes the impact of enemy missiles. However, when available power falls the shield can no longer be maintained and the ship is liable to suffer physical damage. The computer will automatically repair this damage, but systems will temporarily go inoperative while the player continues to suffer attack. There are 9 skill levels. A complete power recharge is awarded every 5000 points.
