Base 3 is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64 The player controls a spaceship that moves in all directions, and fires two streams of lasers directly forwards.  Enemy ships and structures fly towards the player from the top of the screen.  Some enemy vessels are stationary and fire in multiple directions, while others rapidly race towards the player.   There is a single large level with multiple enemies that scrolls past, at which point the player receives a congratulations message and restarts the level.  If the ship is hit by enemy fire or vessels it's lost, and the player starts with 5 ships.
