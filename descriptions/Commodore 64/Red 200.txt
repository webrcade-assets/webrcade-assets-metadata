Red 200 is a game similar to Robbo, a puzzle game in which the player guides a robot. The player must collect all screws scattered around the board while avoiding deadly magnets, nuclear signs and other obstacles. In order to not become attracted by a magnet it's necessary to cover it with a box. Getting to a specific part of a maze requires the use of an appropriate item. Collecting all screws opens an exit door to the next level. The game features 200 levels.
