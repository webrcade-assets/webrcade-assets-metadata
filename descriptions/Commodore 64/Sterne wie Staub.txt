Sterne wie Staub is a German strategic/managerial wargame for one to four players.  The player is the leader of an alien race that ruled over a powerful empire somewhere in a distant galaxy. Other planets were conquered, the inhabitants enslaved and made to work for them. Over time, the rulers evolved into a warrior race that no longer worked themselves but kept slaves and devoted themselves only to warfare, government, and technological advancement. The empire flourished - until the catastrophe. The first signs of gravity changes caused only mild alarm. Panic only broke out when the gigantic black hole reached the borders of the Empire on its all-consuming journey. But by then it was already too late. Planets shattered, suns burst like soap bubbles, were sucked in, nurtured and increased the power of this eerie juggernaut that inexorably roamed the universe. Only a few fleets of transporters, traveling far from the center of the empire for colonization, narrowly escaped the terrible Maelstrom. But there was no longer a destination to head for. Suddenly one became aware of the responsibility as the last survivor of a vanished civilization. The player - as the senior officer - became the new ruler. Rulers of a handful of war divisions, a few million slaves, and meager supplies of food and goods. In this hopeless situation they came up with a daring plan. They froze everything and set the ships on course for a neighboring galaxy a few thousand light-years away. After centuries of flight, the player wakes up from an artificial deep sleep and reports back to their First Centurion.
