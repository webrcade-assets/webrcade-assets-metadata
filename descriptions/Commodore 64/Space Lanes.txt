The Earth is in dire need of fuel, and it is your task to collect some fuel from the space lanes while avoiding the laser fire of the invisible KOPEC robots. Space Lanes is reminiscent of Pac-Man. The player's spaceship is located in a grid-like 'maze', in which are a total of 180 dots representing fuel to be collected, each worth 5 points. Periodically, a laser will fire across a random row from the left side of the screen; if the player is hit by the laser three times, the game ends.
