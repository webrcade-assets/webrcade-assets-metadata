Firing Line is a 1-player arcade game for the Commodore 64. The player controls a spaceship that moves left and right on a line that stretches horizontally across the center of the screen. The ship fires up and down at approaching alien vessels and space debris. The player controls the rate of movement left or right, and if anything hits the line, the player loses a life. A new life is earned every 10,000 points, and the player starts with 3 ships.
