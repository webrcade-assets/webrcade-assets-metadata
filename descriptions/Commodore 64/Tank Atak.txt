Tank Atak plays similar to the Atari arcade game Battlezone , in which you control a tank which must drive left or right across a landscape, shooting enemy tanks and flying saucers in the process. Your tank is equipped with a radar that can be used to help you locate them. Once you do, you need to line them up in your sights and fire missiles once they are within range. Taking too long results in the windscreen getting smashed and the loss of one of your three lives. Lose all your lives and the game is over.
