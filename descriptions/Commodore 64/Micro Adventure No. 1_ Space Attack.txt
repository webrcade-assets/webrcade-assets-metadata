Micro Adventure No. 1: Space Attack is a series of type-in BASIC adventures for multiple systems. Secret agent Orion, computer whiz on ACT (Adventure Connection Team) has received an urgent message from an orbiting space station.  Something has gone deadly wrong.  The evil forces of BRUTE (the Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil) is bent on wrecking havoc. Joined by Colonel Helen Grace, world-class linguist Dr. Macron, astronomer Professor Lowell, and Astro Toys employee Tinker, the team has been sent to the orbiting US military station Rodeo I.  There, the communications system on the station has malfunctioned, and an alien signal from deep space is rapidly approaching. Though the story, there are numerous interactive type-in programs that offer numerous outcomes.  An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with many of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.
