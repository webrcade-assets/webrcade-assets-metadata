Galactic Frontier is an adventure game for the Commodore 64. The explorer searches for life forms among the 200 billions stars in the Milky Way.  Blasting off from Earth, the player can visit numerous star systems, which include randomly generated star types.  Star data including spectral class, luminosity, type, diameter, temperature, and age can be explored.  These star systems may have planets, and planet data including color, chemical analysis, length of year, length of day, and more can be investigated.  Ultimately, the goal is to find habitable planets that may contain types of life.  Stars and planets are graphically displayed on the screen as they are discovered.
