Alien Sidestep is a 1-player arcade game for multiple systems. The player controls a small space ship on the bottom of the screen that moves horizontally, and fires vertically forwards. Aliens spaceships move across the screen from left to right, and move down 1 row upon reaching the edge of the screen. Alien ships will stop moving to try to avoid player fire. If 3 ships make it all the way off the screen, it's game over.
