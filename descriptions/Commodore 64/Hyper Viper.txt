Hyper Viper is a top view maze game where the screen scrolls in various directions when you move, and the aim is to eat all the snakes on various levels to move to the next level. You must only eat the snakes from behind and if you eat try to eat the snake from the front then you are eaten and you lose one of three lives. Eating a snake in the middle splits the snake in two increasing the number of snakes to eat. Also on screen are an insect which can be eaten but if you allow it to move around the maze then it lays eggs. These eggs will hatch, creating a creature that must be avoided. Fruit makes an appearance also in the maze and can be eaten for bonuses.
