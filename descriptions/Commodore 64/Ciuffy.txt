In the game made with SEUCK (Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit) you control Ciuffy the dog on his way out the city, because the community wants to capture him for some brutal reasons. So you should move in four directions, shoot the enemies (people, tanks, radars, etc.) with a certain number of BAUs, collect the bones, and avoid their attacks. You'll get an extra live for each 10,000 points.
