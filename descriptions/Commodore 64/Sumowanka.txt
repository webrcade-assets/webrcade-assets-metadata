Sumowanka is a simple logic game. The computer creates an 8x8 board and fills it with numbers from 1 to 99. The player chooses a number in the column and the computer in the same row. The object of the game is to select numbers in such a way that you end up having more of them than your opponent. The game ends if any player can no longer choose any number or the last number on the board is selected.
