In Taxman you take control of Humfrey who must go around collecting tax in the game's ten levels. The tax is collected by killing "Herberts" which appear on both sides of the screen. When killed, they release coins which must be collected immediately before they make their way to the top of the screen and disappear. Occasionally, a dart will making its way towards you, so don't spend too long in the one spot. If you gather enough coins, you will proceed to the next level. The further you progress through the game, the more faster the Herberts become. Contact with any of them or letting a dart hit you will result in your life force being drained, and the game ends when this is depleted. Bumping into any force fields will result in instant death. Taxman is a score-attack game; if all ten levels are completed, the game loops back to the first level, but your score does not reset.
