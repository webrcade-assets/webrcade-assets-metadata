Nautilus is an action game where the player controls a diver who is searching for gold that lies somewhere on the bottom of the ocean. To obtain the gold the player needs to swim through the dark tunnels of a cave system and get the "sleutels" ( keys) first, which are scattered around. Each key will automatically open ONE door and then the player can swim further to reach the other areas. Now it is necessary to find the "Tas" ( bag). This is where the gold bars should be placed (one at a time) and then safely brought to the surface. After a gold bar is safely brought to the surface, the player must return to the "Tas" to collect the next gold bar and so on. The main hazards encountered are the sharp rocks, green sea weed and the sea life that swims around. Touching them will cost the player a life. The player has a harpoon gun, but has only fifteen harpoons. With each gold bar brought to the surface the player will get ten harpoons back. While exploring underwater, the air supply slowly depletes so the player must find the "EXTRA Lucht" ( extra air) to refuel if it is necessary. The player earns 5 points per key, 10 points for gold, for bringing up gold to the surface 20 points and for every 40 seconds underwater, 7 minus the chosen number of lives will be added to your score. You can choose how many lives you want to start with (3 to 6) and also choose the difficulty level between "Langzaam" ( slow) or "Snel" ( fast).
