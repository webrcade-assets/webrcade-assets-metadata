Katakis was the first R-Type influenced side scrolling shoot 'em up. You control the H-75 Eagle Fighter against the machines which have overrun a peaceful planet, with an indestructible satellite and collectable power-ups to help you through 12 levels. Each of these have lots of parallax scrolling and some direct influences from films including Aliens and The Terminator. The game can be played in co-op with one player steering the ship and another steering the satellite (C64 version only).
