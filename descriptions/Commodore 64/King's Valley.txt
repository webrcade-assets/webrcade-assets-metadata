King's Valley is a homebrew puzzle game based on the 1985 Konami game of the same name. You need to collect all the treasure by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again.
