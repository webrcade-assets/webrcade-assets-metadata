Starforce Fighter is a horizontally scrolling space shooter for the Commodore 64. The player controls a space fighter that moves in all directions and fires to the right.  Each level is divided into 3 sections.  First, the player encounters multiple waves of enemy vessels that approach from the right.  These must be eliminated or avoided.  Powerups can be collected, which temporarily speed up or slow down enemy movement, make the player invisible, or boost firepower.  After clearing numerous waves, the player enters a second section that involves avoiding incoming asteroids.  Finally, the player enters a bonus stage where they try to collect power ups.  After each level, the player enters a more challenging area with faster moving enemies and addition structures and dangers to avoid.  The player starts with 9 ships.
