Monsters & Magic is a 1-player text-based role playing game for the TRS-80 CoCo. The player creates a new level 1 character that randomly rolls strength, intelligence, wisdom, constitution, dexterity, and charisma. Player hit points and starting gold are also randomly rolled, and the player purchases starting equipment which provide armor class. The player moves through randomly generated rooms. In each area, the player can search, move to the next location, fight enemies, buy supplies, and check their inventory and status. When searching, the player can discover gold, arms, or armor. The player can also encounter evil clerics which destroy the player's equipment. When encountering an enemy, the player and monster take turns rolling for a hit. When a hit is scored, the player rolls for the amount of damage. Monsters have individual armor class, possible damage, hit points, and number of attacks per round.
