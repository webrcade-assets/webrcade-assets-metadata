Ring Master is a series of 3 circus-themed arcade games for the Commodore 64. Divided into 3 acts, the player tries to master the trampoline, firing from a cannon, and swinging on the trapeze. In Act 1, the player tries to maximize jumping height on a trampoline, and then jumps onto a seesaw to propel a woman onto a waiting group of acrobats. The player must have sufficient height to reach the seesaw, and hit with sufficient force to allow the woman to reach safety. In Act 2, the player sets the angle and power of a cannon to shoot a man through a hoop and land into a bucket of water. As the man approaches the hoop, the player has to quickly raise it to allow the man to pass, and then has to set the time for the man to land in the water. In Act 3, the player must time the release of a swinging trapeze artist to allow them to safely catch another moving trapeze.
