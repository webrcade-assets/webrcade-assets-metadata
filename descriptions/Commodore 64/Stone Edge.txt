Stone Edge is a game of logical thinking and dexterity. You are moving a small ball over a playing field filled with "stones". You have to turn all those stones into blue color while avoiding dropping from the playing field, hitting the flashing circles or running out of time. There are some special stones on the playing field (which will vanish after you moved over them), giving you special extras like invulnerability.
