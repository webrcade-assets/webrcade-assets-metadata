Super Blitz is a one-key arcade game, similar to Air Attack. The player is the pilot of a light bomber aircraft running out of fuel. Their only hope is to flatten the city to enable the aircraft to land. Bonus points are awarded for landing, or for obliterating King Kong while he is climbing a skyscraper. It is a one-key game, which means the plane cannot be steered. It is only possible to drop bombs by pressing the spacebar (or joystick button). The plane moves from left to right across the screen, slightly descending every time it wraps back to the left side. The lower the aircraft flies the more urgent it becomes to target the highest skyscrapers. There are two extra gameplay elements compared to 1979's Air Attack. The first is a big gorilla that walks from right to left, it will climb any skyscraper that is high enough provided that it is isolated. It can only be bombed when it is climbing a building. Secondly, there is a big white cloud floating around, but it does nothing except obscure the view as the plane flies through it, making it harder to target the buildings below.
