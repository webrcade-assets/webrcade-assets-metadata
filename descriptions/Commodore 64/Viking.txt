Viking is a 1 - 4 player strategy game for the TRS-80 CoCo. Each player takes control of an independent city state starting in the year 750, with the goal to outperform their neighbors over a number of years. Each year, the player must allocate resources to maintenance and growth of their grain production, as well as their fishing fleet. The goal is to promote population growth by adequately managing resources. Rats pose constant danger to grain stores, and losses can be minimized by maintaining a healthy population of ferrets. Guards can help protect fishing fleets and the population. The player has to raise taxes to pay for their expenditures. The player can enhance their city by purchasing fishing boats, markets, armories, temples, adding onto their hall, and more acreage. If the population is overly exploited they may revolt, causing great damage to resources and infrastructure.
