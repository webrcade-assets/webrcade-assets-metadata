In a choose-your-own-adventure narrative not for children, the player controls a 12-year-old runaway boy, bored and frustrated with his stifling home life and on the verge of experiencing a lot more of the world's peaks and valleys than he ever could have anticipated.  Horrifying ends and/or unbelievable pleasures await him, depending on the direction of the player through the selections of two or three options offered at plot crossroads. In the original release, plot thread conclusion terminated the program, though in the expanded remake, the player is given the option to return to the beginning and explore alternate, un-chosen plot forks.
