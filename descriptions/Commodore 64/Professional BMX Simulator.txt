Professional BMX Simulator is the successor to BMX Simulator and has the same gameplay principle: racing on top-down circuits against the clock. The most apparent improvement to the predecessor is that there are four athletes on the course; all either controlled by human players or the AI. However, despite the opponents a single-player race simply requires a certain amount of laps within a time limit. The 15 circuits are split across three styles - dirtbike, quarry racing and desert riding. Besides the standard version, the player may also choose to play the game in expert difficulty. This mode not only has harder time limits, but also introduces different tyre and chain-wheel sizes to choose from (influencing the bike's performance depending on the course) and collision detection between the athletes.
