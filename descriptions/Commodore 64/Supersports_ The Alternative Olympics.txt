Supersports: The Alternative Olympics is a sports game with five humorous disciplines which are played one after another. At the end the player with the most points wins. The disciplines are: Crack Shot is similar to skeet shooting, just on a back alley with cans as targets. Shooting a cat gives minus points. Dare Devil Dive is reminiscent to a circus attraction: jumping from a high pole (three heights) into a water pub. Points are also rewarded for performing moves during the fall. Slate Smash involves smashing slates with the bare hands. Cross Bow is a regular target shooting discipline. The player needs to set the position of the crossbow and the shooting power while taking the wind direction into account. Under Water Assault Course is an underwater obstacle course. Collecting coins rewards extra points.
