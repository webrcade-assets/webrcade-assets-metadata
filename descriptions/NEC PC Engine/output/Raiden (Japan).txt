Go ballistic with intense arcade action! The year is 2090 and it could be our last. Alien invaders are scorching the earth with vastly superior firepower. Our only hope is Raiden, an untested supersonic fighter built with captured enemy technology, and only you are ace enough to handle it! Power up your laser for deadly accuracy or wide shots of lethal fire! Zero in with your homing missiles. Then nuke those fiends deep into space! You're on their turf now. Blast 'em and return victorious or they'll be back to finish us off!
