Ever felt underpowered and lacking in omnipotence? Well now is your chance to live the dream in Populous, Bullfrog's seminal god game. Domination is the aim here - you control a community of cute little guys and must build a population greater than your computer controlled rival. Starting with a house or two, you are at first limited to raising and lowering the ground - the flatter the ground around a domicile, the more advanced it becomes, up to the level of a sturdy fort. But this is not the extent of your power. More houses mean more people, and more people means the higher your little arrow creeps along your power bar, opening up such furious skills to inflict on your opponent like floods, swamps and volcanoes that disrupt the landscape and any city planning therein. Once you feel you have sufficiently dominated the opposition (the display on the top right conveniently gives you a visual guide here) then you release armageddon - all followers gather together and duke it out until there is only one. Depending on your score, you then move forward any number of levels which include diverse scenery such as grasslands, desert, snow and volcanic rock.
