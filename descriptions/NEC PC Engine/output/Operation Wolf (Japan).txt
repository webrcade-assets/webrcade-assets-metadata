Being a one-man army is a difficult business - just ask that bloke Rambo. But you have taken on the hard task of mowing down whole platoons of enemy forces single handed, all to rescue hostages from a rather nasty concentration camp. Choosing from one of four stages, you have a first person view of the action and have to carefully aim your on-screen crosshair to take out the bad guys - but don't get too trigger happy, as there are many civilians and innocents who have chosen just this moment to go for a stroll in the middle of a raging firefight. You have limited ammunition, which can be replenished by shooting the spare clips lying around (which are also dropped from objects such as coconuts and birds), and also a small supply of extra powerful rockets which make short work of armoured vehicles or helicopters that have you in their sights. Occasionally you will see a pile of dynamite that serves as a smart bomb, and a nice energy drink which increases your health slightly - which is essential as it does not recover between levels.
