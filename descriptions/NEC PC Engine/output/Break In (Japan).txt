The Engine doesn't really have much in the way of pool games. In fact, this is the only one that I can think of. It looks and plays like those games you used to see in arcades and has plenty of options to choose from. Firstly you get to choose from simulation, action and technique (which lets you try out loads of trick shots). Then, you can play against other humans, your coach or try out the challenge mode that sets you up as a stowaway on a cruise liner, having to beat 14 opponents to be let off the hook! The play screen is laid out clearly - you aim by positioning a target anywhere on the table (unlike some games that make you aim to the cushion), then you can choose the regulars like spin and shot power.
