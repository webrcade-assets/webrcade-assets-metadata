This disc was included with the PC Engine Fan magazine. It contains a reduced version of Virgin Dream (lacking features such as saving and loading), as well as two homebrew games: Frisbee Ken John, where the player controls a dog and jump to catch frisbee discs, and Maru-Maru, a very simple one-stage Breakout variant.
