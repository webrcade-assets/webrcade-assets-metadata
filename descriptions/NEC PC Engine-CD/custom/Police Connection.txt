Police Connection is a board game with a twist: instead of simply reaching a goal or collecting money, players take the roles of police detective and investigate crimes. There are three cases in the game, all accessible from the main menu: two murders (the victims being young women), and one case of missing money. Up to four human- or AI-controlled characters are trying to solve these mysteries.
