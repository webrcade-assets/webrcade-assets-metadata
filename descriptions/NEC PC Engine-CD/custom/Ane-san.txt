Ane-San is a two-player brawler on the PC Engine Super CD that's like a cross between Renegade and Final Fight but with an all-girl cast. You can play as any boss character after defeating them, although each character counts as a life. It uniquely features huge portraits for every enemy character as well as a high-quality rockabilly soundtrack including renditions of Lollypop, Johnny B. Goode, and even Swan Lake.
