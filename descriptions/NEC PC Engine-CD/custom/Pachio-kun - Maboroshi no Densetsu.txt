Pachio-kun: Maboroshi no Densetsu is a pachinko game starring the semi-anthropomorphic character Pachio-kun. The goal of the game is to win as many jewels as possible by collecting points in pachinko games. The player has a limited control over Pachio-kun in top-down casinos, where the game can be saved, points exchanged for jewels, and all the pachinko machines accessed. The machines are presented in first-person view and come in varied flavors and designs, with different backgrounds, themes, and contraptions. Playing the machines involves adjusting the strength of the shot and then pressing the action button to release the balls. The player can also opt to view each detail of the machine on a zoomed-in screen. The game comes with a special controller that resembles a real pachinko joystick.
