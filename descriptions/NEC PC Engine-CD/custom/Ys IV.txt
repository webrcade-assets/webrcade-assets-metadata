Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys (イースフォー ザドーンオブイース Īsu 4: Za Dōn Obu Īsu?) is an action role-playing game developed for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM, and is the fourth game in the Ys video game series. Ys series creators Nihon Falcom Corporation licensed its development to Hudson Soft.\nThe Dawn of Ys was released in 1993 and was one of two games released under the title of \"Ys IV\", the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV: Mask of the Sun for the Super Famicom. The two games share the same setting, but Hudson took more liberties with its presentation in The Dawn of Ys, and two unique games resulted.
