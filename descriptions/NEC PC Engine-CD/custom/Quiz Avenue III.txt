Quiz Avenue III offers, like its two predecessors, a quest mode and a versus mode - the latter consists in this installment of a series of trivia questions for up to eight players (controlling a variety of tough-looking fighters), with rounds disguised as fighting games, each wrong answer leading to a loss of hit points. The main difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.
