Nariagari Trendy is an adaptation of the Japanese board game sugoroku - the Monopoly-like "Game of Life" version rather than the backgammon variant. Four characters, controlled by human players or computer AI, move on a board that represents a city, earning money and points on the way. The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions. Another type of fields leads to a store run by the cat Nyan from Cosmic Fantasy games, who offers special cards for money.
