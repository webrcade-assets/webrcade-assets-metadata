Super Air Zonk is the sequel to the 1992 game Air Zonk, both of which are part of the Bonk series of games. As a sequel, Super Air Zonk contains all-new levels, assistants, and enemies, as well as a Red Book CD audio soundtrack consisting of rockabilly music. While the original Air Zonk relied heavily on multilayer parallax scrolling, Super Air Zonk features mostly single-plane backgrounds with a few exceptions.
