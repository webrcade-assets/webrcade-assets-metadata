Like most games based on the Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Datō, Ganso Musabetsu Kakutō-Ryū! is a fighting game. Unlike the earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the same company, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such as the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc.
