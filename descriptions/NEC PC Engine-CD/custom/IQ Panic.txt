IQ Panic is a quiz game with a background story. A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengor≈ç to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss "battles", etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter.
