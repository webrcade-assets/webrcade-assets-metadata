Formation Soccer 95 della Serie A is a soccer (football) game that re-creates a season in the top football league of Italy, including licensed players and teams. There is no management element in the game; players simply have to choose one or more (for tournament mode) teams and participate in either exhibition or Serie A (Italian Championship) games. Teams can be controlled by human players or computer AI; it is also possible to select the "watch" mode and view the game unfolding with both teams being controlled by the computer. Practice mode for corner, free, and penalty kicks is included as well. Rules and conditions can be changed (e.g. it is possible to play without injuries).
