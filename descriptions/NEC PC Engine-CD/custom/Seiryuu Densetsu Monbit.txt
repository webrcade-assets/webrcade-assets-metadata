On one fateful night, a purple meteor has fallen down from the skies. Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon.
