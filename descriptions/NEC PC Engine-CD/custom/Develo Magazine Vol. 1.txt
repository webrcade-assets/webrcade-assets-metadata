A disc entitled Develo Magazine Vol. 1 was included in the 1996 edition of the Super PC Engine Fan Deluxe magazine. The disc contains two demo versions of previously released commercial games: Fray in Magical Adventure CD: Xak Gaiden and Popful Mail. In addition, two homebrew games made with the PC Engine development kit Develo are included. Frisbee Ken John is a one-button game in which the player controls a dog who must jump and catch frisbee flying discs. Speeder is a simple racing game with third-person pseudo-3D view, where the player-controlled vehicle must stay on the road in order to survive.
