Its sub-title translated as True Scary Stories, Hyaku Monogatari is a video game homage to the parlour game Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.
