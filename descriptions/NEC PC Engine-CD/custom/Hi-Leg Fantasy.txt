Long time ago, the races of humans and fairy creatures co-existed peacefully. But the power of magic corrupted some of them. The magic users were divided into those who supported the Light and those who turned to Darkness. The balance was broken, and peace between humans and fairy creatures were no longer possible. One day, a wandering samurai is caught in a storm on a sea; washed ashore, he loses his memory. Teaming up with two other warriors, the hero meets a benevolent sorceress named Garland, who sends them on a quest to rid the land of fairy creatures who got rampant, and help her in her battle against the evil sorceress whose plan is to destroy peace forever.
