The Pro Yakyū Super is a follow-up to The Pro Yakyū. Gameplay mechanics are nearly identical to that of the predecessor. Along with the simulation and auto modes for pitching and batting, there is now also a new "auto catch" mode. Licensed teams from the professional Japanese baseball league have been updated to the current season. Versus, Open, and Pennant modes return, along with a "Dream" mode, which consists of a game between contemporary All-Star players and historical ones.
