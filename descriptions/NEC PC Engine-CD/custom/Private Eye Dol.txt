Some day in the near future, the crew of an "idol" (a popular culture star) takes a ride on the bus through the countryside. One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby. Very soon, however, the accident begins to repeat itself, and evidence of a gruesome murder and possible ghostly presence in the mansion surfaces. Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.
