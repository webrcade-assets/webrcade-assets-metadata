Go! Go! Birdie Chance is an anime-style golf game. The player controls female high school students who assemble a golf team and wish to remain undefeated. The story mode contains extensive text-based cutscenes, depicting the girls' struggle against an arrogant male golfer, with golf matches proceeding as dictated by the plot. The free mode allows one or two players to select any of the three available female characters and compete against each other or computer AI. It is possible to select golf club types, course terrain, strike types, and the player's strong hand. Strength and direction of the shot is determined by stopping a moving bar at the right moment.
