YakyÅ«ken no Uta is, like other games in the series, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese actresses. There is no story in the game; players can simply choose to compete either in four- or two-player mahjong tournaments, selecting individual participants or teams from a list. The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.
