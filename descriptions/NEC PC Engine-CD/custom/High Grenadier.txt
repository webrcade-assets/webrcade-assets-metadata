High Grenadier is a turn-based strategy game with role-playing elements. The game has a rather abstract plot that depicts a battle between two human organizations, each piloting and commanding giant mechs; no further details are revealed in the game. The gameplay takes place on a battlefield composed out of dots connected by lines; both player-controlled and opponent's army can move only between adjacent dots.
