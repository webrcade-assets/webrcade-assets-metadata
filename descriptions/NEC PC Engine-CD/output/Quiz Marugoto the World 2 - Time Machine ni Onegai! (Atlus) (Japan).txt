Time Machie ni Onegai differs from its predecessor by having its own unique gameplay modes rather than strictly following a TV game show format. The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the Three Kingdoms era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question.
