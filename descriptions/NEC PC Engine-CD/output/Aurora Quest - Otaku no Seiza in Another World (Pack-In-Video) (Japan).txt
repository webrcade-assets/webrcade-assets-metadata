Aurora Quest is a remake of Otaku no Seiza: An Adventure in the Otaku Galaxy. This version retains the premise, principal story elements, as well much of the enemy design from the original game. The game's locations, however, have been heavily modified, the cities being much larger and containing many more different types of buildings. The world map layout, the dungeons, and the actual game progression involving quests and missions are quite different as well. Gameplay system preserves the simple turn-based combat of the original, while adding new special moves and eliminating the need to select menu commands for dialogue and interaction.
