An unlicensed release for the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console, Shiawase Usagi describes an episode in the life of a male high-school student named Takita Hiroki. His parents aren't at home, and he invites his girlfriend with only one goal in his mind... If you guessed "discuss with her Schopenhauer's philosophy and the conflict in the Middle East", you're wrong. The young man wants to "score" with the girl, which effectively sums up the game's entire narrative.
