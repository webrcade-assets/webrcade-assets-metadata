CD Battle is a game for two players that prompts each of them to insert an audio CD into the console in order to generate a party of three characters for each player, which then engage in a turn-based battle. The characters belong to different classes (warrior, mage, ninja, etc.) and have different parameters and special attacks. Despite the game's visual similarity to contemporary Final Fantasy games, it has no true role-playing elements and consists entirely of battles.
