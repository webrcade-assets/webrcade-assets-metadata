Bish≈çjo Janshi Idol Pai is an unlicensed strip mahjong game presented as battles between mechas. The player controls young women clad in robotic suits, who compete against similarly equipped female opponents in the game of mahjong. There is only one mode in the game, and the player has no ability of selecting the controllable character or the antagonist. Each round won by the player depletes a portion of the opponent's "health", which results in gradual undressing culminating in full nudity.
