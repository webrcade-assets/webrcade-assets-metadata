This enhanced version of the earlier computer release allows the player to play either of the games directly from the main menu. Both games feature some re-drawn artwork and remixed soundtrack, as well as voice-overs that were not present in the computer versions. The protagonists' names have been changed to Naoki Muraoka (Sotsugy≈ç Shashin) and Tetsuya Watanabe (Miki).
