CD Mahjong Bishōjo Chūshinha is a strip mahjong game. The player competes against any of the three available characters, young girls named Haruna, Natsumi, and Chiaki. The rules are standard mahjong, without any extras. Losing a single round leads to Game Over. Winning, on the other hand, makes the girl remove a part of her clothing in an animated scene.
