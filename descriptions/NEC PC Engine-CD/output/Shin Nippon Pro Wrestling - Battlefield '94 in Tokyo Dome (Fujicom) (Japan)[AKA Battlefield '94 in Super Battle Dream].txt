Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling 94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome allows the players to experience Japan's most popular professional wrestling promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.
