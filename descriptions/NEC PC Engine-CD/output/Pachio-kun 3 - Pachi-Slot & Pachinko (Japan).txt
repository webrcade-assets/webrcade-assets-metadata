As its tile implies, Pachio-kun 3: Pachisuro & Pachinko is a pachinko game starring Pachio-kun, an anthropomorphic pachinko ball who enjoys a peaceful life with his family on the Pachinko Planet. The game's plot is rather abstract and serves to tie together various time periods to which the hero travels after completing pachinko-playing sections. In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.
