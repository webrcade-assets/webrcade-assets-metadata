Once upon a time, the brave warriors of the Fire Clan fought the dark lord Masakado and defeated him, saving the beautiful land of Jipang. Many years later, the followers of the Daimon Cult tried to resurrect Masakado, but were defeated by the thief Ziria and other descendants of the Fire Clan. Kabuki Danjūrō, a flamboyant kabuki performer who fought together with the great hero Manjimaru and helped him defeat the guardians of the Dark Orchids, receives a letter from Orochimaru, one of the heroes of the battle against the Daimon Cult. It seems that the followers of this evil organization have raised their ugly heads again. Several young women were kidnapped, and Orochimaru suspects it was the work of Daimon Cult. Being a perfect gentleman, Kabuki agrees to abandon his flourishing acting career for a while, rescue the girls, and slay the evil.
