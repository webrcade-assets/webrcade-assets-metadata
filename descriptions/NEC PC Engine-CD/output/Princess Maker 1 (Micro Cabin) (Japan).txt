Princess Maker is the first of Gainax' "princess-raising simulation" game series. You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria.
