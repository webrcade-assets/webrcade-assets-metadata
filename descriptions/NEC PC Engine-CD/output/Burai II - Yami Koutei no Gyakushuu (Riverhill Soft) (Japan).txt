The beautiful planet Kypros, with its lovely view and rich population: humans, gods, intelligent animals... long ago, the god of light Risk and the god of darkness Daar engaged in a prolonged battle which ended with Risk's victory. Bido, the emperor of darkness, tried to revive Daar, but was stopped by the eight legendary heroes, the bearers of eight magical pearls, who united to participate in this cosmic struggle. Peace has returned to Kypros, but not for long. Bido was not completely defeated and is now planning an evil scheme that goes beyond resurrecting Daar. Peace is once again threatened, and the eight heroes have to find each other again and to fight for justice once more!
