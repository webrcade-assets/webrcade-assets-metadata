Quiz Marugoto the World is a simple simulation of a TV trivia game. TV hosts ask questions on various topics (the questions are spoken, not displayed in text), and the correct answer must be chosen among several available ones within a time limit. The game show has three modes: "World Quiz Trip", championship, and cup. The first is essentially a single-player mode; the championship allows players to compete against each other, with topics randomly chosen; the cup works like any comparable sports event, including elimination rounds.
