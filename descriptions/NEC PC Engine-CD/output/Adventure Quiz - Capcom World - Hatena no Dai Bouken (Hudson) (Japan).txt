Adventure Quiz is a compilation of two games previously released on the arcades, Capcom World and Hatena? no Daib≈çken. Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with medieval/fantasy backgrounds. Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.
