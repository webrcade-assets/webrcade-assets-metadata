Quiz Avenue is a trivia game with a "quest mode" in which the player controls a warrior who must save the princess Questine from the clutches of evil Shameless, the enemies of the Erudition kingdom. The player navigates the hero on small boards with branching paths; each point of interest represents a quiz "battle" against a monster, culminating in a "boss battle" on the final stage, where the player is able to select the topic of the questions (e.g. geography, movies, English language, etc.). Quiz encounters vary in length and amount of answers to choose from, but always have a time limit for each question. In addition, a separate "party mode" allows players to compete in trivia games, each consisting of three or five rounds.
