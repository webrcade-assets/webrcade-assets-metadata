CD Hanafuda Bish≈çjo Club is a strip hanafuda card game. The player can select to compete against any of the five AI-controlled opponents, all presented as pretty young women. Two variants of hanafuda can be played: koi-koi, in which players have to collect specific combinations of cards, and a simplified version where cards are matched by suit and the player with most points wins. The girls remove an item of their clothes after each round, until they undress completely.
