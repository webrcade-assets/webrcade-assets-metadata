Gulclight TDF2 is a turn-based tactical game and a follow-up to T.D.F.. There is no background story information in the game besides the notion of TDF2, an organization consisting of aircraft and mechas, fighting an alien race known as Plea. The gameplay is quite simple: the player is presented with a fairly small isometric screen and must navigate a handful of fighters on it, attacking an alien when he is on the adjacent square. Player-controlled mechas and vehicles come in different types: some are strong but have limited manoeuvrability, others have a wide movement range but weak armor, etc. Battles are shown on a separate screen and proceed automatically, both sides exchanging an attack.
