The fourth installment of the sci-fi RPG series comes in two parts, this game being the first. In it, the player once again takes control of the original hero of the series, the cosmic hunter Yū, his lovely female comrade Saya, and their friends. Something is wrong on the planet Kazarin: the princess Saria was kidnapped, and Yū arrives on the planet to look closer into that matter, while Saya agrees to impersonate the princess for a while to ensure a calm investigation. However, their quest goes far beyond the kidnapping investigation: soon they will have to face the four heavenly kings, demons who control the elements from which the universe is built.
