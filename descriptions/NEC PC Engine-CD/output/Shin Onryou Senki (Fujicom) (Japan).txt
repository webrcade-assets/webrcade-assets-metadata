Shin Onryō Senki is a remake of Onryō Senki. The story and most of the dialogues remain the same as in the original release; gameplay-wise, the versions are also nearly identical, utilizing the same menu-based verb-object commands. The differences lie mostly in visual presentation and technical quality of the music. The graphics are by far more technically advanced; most locations have been re-drawn from scratch. Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.
