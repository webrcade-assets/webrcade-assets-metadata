In MeikyÅ« no Elfeane, the player takes the role of a real person - the Japanese singer and actress Tomomi Nishimura - in her hand-drawn, "super-deformed", anime-style, top-down-viewed incarnation (digitized photos of the real Ms. Nishimura can be seen during some of the game's cut scenes). In the game, Tomomi is just a simple girl who works in a restaurant, but gets magically transported to a fairy land. There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world.
