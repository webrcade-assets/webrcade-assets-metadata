Somewhere on the beautiful planet Aira, in a small village Toto lives a young boy named Rei. Rei possesses unique spiritual powers, using which he can heal diseases. One day, Rei is ordered to go to Tristan, the Royal Capital, where he is needed. This seems like a simple journey; but shortly afterwards Rei meets the cat Nyan, who got stranded on Aira following a hostile encounter with Burakki, Gorokki, and Chorokki, intergalactic feline travelers with unknown agenda. The boy realizes that his powers might be needed to aid the heroes of the previous Cosmic Fantasy installments, and deal with the mysterious Garudo, who recently came to Aira, plotting an evil scheme.
