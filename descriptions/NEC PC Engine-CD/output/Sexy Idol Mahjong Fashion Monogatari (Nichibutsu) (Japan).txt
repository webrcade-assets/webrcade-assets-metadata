Fashion Monogatari is, like its predecessor, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese female "idols". Gameplay-wise, however, this installment is quite different: it is a board game in which the player navigates a character by throwing dice to determine the number of moves. Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.
