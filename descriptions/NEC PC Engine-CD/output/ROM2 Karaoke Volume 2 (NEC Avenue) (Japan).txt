ROM² Karaoke: Volume 2 is the second in the series of karaoke discs by NEC Avenue. Like the other discs, it was supplied with a sound system called ROM² AMP, which included microphone, mixer, and speakers. Songs are played on different backgrounds, some of which display digitized photos, while others feature hand-drawn graphics. Backgrounds may dynamically change with the song, and some of them offer rudimentary interaction.
