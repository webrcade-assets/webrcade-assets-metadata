The Pro Yakyū Super '94 is a follow-up to The Pro Yakyū Super. With the exception of a new mode, different music, commentary, and slight interface changes, the gameplay is largely identical to that of the previous entry. Rosters of the licensed professional Japanese baseball teams have been updated to the current season. The new mode is called "Home Run Contest"; the player controls a batter against a computer-controlled pitcher, trying to score a home run.
