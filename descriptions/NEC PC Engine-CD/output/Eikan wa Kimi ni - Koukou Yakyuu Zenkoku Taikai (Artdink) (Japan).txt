Eikan wa Kimi ni is a Japanese high school baseball management game. The player creates a manager, choosing his birthday, blood group, preferences, etc., which influence his standing with the team and players. During the management phase, it is necessary to assemble the team, choosing between various male high school students, each with his own statistics. The manager then makes schedules for the players, which include training sessions of varying difficulty. It is also possible to change the manager's mood, which leads to different results depending on the team's spirit and personality. The player can advance the time by one day, one week, or until the next event, e.g. a test in the school or a game against another team.
