You start the game as a nameless warrior (you can name the hero as you like). He returns to his home village, only to find it burnt down, and his beloved woman dead. Kneeling at her grave, the warrior swears revenge, but this quest soon turns out to go far beyond it, as demonic forces are threatening the land!
