This installment of Shiawase Usagi abandons the heroines of the two previous games in favor of characters curiously named after Neon Genesis Evangelion heroes: the protagonist is called Shinji, the love interests Misato and Asuka, etc. The plot, however, has little to do with that of the anime series: the hero is a horny young man (aren't we all?) who is watching a porn movie and decides to get some real "action". Afterwards, it becomes a series of sexual encounters, which proceed depending on the player's choices.
