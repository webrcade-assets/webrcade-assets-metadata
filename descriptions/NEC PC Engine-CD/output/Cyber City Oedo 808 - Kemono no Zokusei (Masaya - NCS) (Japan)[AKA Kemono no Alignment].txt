Kemono no Zokusei is an adventure game based on the anime series Cyber City Oedo 808 by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The events of the anime and the game are set in 2808. Computerized crime has become rampant, and police has restored an ancient Japanese feudal habit of hiring particularly dangerous convicts to hunt down criminals. The player takes control of one of such convicts, Shunsuke Sengoku, the main protagonist of the anime. He must find his companions, the blind ex-boxer and hacker Gogol, and the effeminate Benten, in order to complete an assignment given to him by the police and eventually lower his sentence in prison.
