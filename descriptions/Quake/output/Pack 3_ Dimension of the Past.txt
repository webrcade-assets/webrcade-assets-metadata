Dimension of the Past (called "DOPA" for short) is an add-on episode for Quake developed by MachineGames, to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary. It's available to download for free, and was also included in the modern Quake port. It is the fourth episode (third 'expansion') in the Quake Remaster release (following Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity), and is followed by the newest episode, Dimension of the Machine.
