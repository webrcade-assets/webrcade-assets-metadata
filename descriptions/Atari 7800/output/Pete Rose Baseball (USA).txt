It's the last game of the World Series. You're in the 9th innings. Bases loaded. One out. And your up to bat.

What do you do? Swing away? Wait for a walk? Go for the fences? It's all up to you, just like in real pro ball.

Sure, we'll give you the options. And some tips. Like in pitching. Batting. And Fielding. But, it's you call .

There are 6 full-color, live action screens - just like the ones you see on TV! The pitching/battting screen, left infield, right infield, leftfield, centerfield and rightfield.

So, start warming up. Step up to the plate. And take your best swing at winning
the series!
