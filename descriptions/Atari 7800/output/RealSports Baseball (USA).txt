You smell the freshly cut grass as you walk out of the dark, cool tunnel into the hot afternoon sun. You hear the crack of leather on wood as the team's power hitter takes batting practice. Today's the day -- you're starting in the big leagues. After warming up in the bullpen, you're ready to take the mound. You get a few last-minute instructions from the pitching coach, and then it's time. Slowly you walk to the center of the diamond. The batter steps in, and you're ready to play ball!
