Returning home after years of study under a Master of Karate, you find your village burned to the ground. Your friends and family are scattered, your bride-to-be stolen by Akuma, the warlord whose oppressive shadow has darkened your village since before you were born.

Your grief and rage turn to cold determination. You vow never again to submit to the evil warlord. You know you must avenge your village and rescue your beloved Princess Mariko from Akuma’s mountain fortress.

Alone, armed only with your knowledge of Karate, you must outfight Akuma’s vicious warriors, each one more powerful than the last. Fight on, deep into the heart of the palace, where to rescue Mariko you must confront the cruel Akuma himself in hand-to-hand combat.

Put fear and self-concern behind you. Focus your will on your objective, accepting death as a possibility, and do what you have chosen to do. This is the Way of the Karateka.
