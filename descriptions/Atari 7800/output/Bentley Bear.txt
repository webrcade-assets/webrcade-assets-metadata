Your goal in Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest is to retrieve all five Crystals that Berthilda has stolen while avoiding all of the enemies, hazards, and pitfalls that await you in your quest. You begin the game with three turns, and you can earn more along the way. You also have an energy meter, which depletes as you work your way through each level.
