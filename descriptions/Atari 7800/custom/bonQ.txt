Play by jumping on cubes, jumping on green objects, and luring the Snake to his death. When all of the cubes have been changed to the change to color, you will advance to the next round. After every four rounds you will advance to the next level. Later levels require jumping on cubes multiple times and the cubes will change in different color sequences, increasing the challenge of advancing to the next round.
