A port of the arcade game of the same name. In Astro Blaster, one or two players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special warp button allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his/her own ship and laser fire at normal speed.
