"The bomb is armed." This is where you come in. You are an ace pilot. The best. Your trusty ship, the Greenwing, is equipped with a state of the art Gravity Beam, capable of hauling any cargo through the most treacherous terrain. Your mission is to negotiate the caverns of Mars and locate the nuclear device, engage your ship's gravity beam to collect the device, and carry it back through the caves and out into space, where it can be detonated safely.
