World Soccer, known as Great Soccer in the US (though not the same as Great Soccer released in Europe and Japan), and Super Futebol in Brazil, is a sports game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Master System. The game was rereleased in Japan a year later under the name Sports Pad Soccer, which was bundled with the Sega Sports Pad.
