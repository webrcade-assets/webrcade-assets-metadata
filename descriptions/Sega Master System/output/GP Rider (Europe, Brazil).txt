GP Rider is a simple, arcade motorbike game for the Master System. While the game does have its weaknesses, it is known to give an overall enjoyable high speed experience. The games most interesting aspect is that it is played permanently in a split screen, regardless of if one or two players are playing. If only one player is racing then the second player is replaced by a computer opponent called "Wayne." Unique for a 8-bit game is that "Wayne" plays like a human player. He has good races and bad races. He passes riders and he has crashes. This is years ahead of its time considering other racing games of the era where the main opponent is programmed to always finish in the same position
