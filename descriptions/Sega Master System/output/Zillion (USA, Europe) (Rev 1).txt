The White Knights, a peacekeeping force within the Planetary System, are on a mission to destroy the evil Norsa Empire's base on Planet X. In order to do so, JJ, the main character from the anime, must infiltrate the base and acquire the five floppy disks that will enable him to input the self-destruct sequence into the base's mainframe computer. Mothership lands on the surface of the planet, and JJ must make his way through the labyrinthine base, fighting enemies, avoiding hazards and possibly rescuing two of his captured allies on his way to destroy the base.
