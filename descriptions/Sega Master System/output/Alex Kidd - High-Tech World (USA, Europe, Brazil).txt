Alex Kidd is contacted by one of his friends, who tells him a new arcade, High Tech World, has opened in town. Alex has a map to its location, but it has been torn into eight pieces, and is needed to find the arcade before it closes at 5:00 sharp. He solves puzzles, answers questions, runs errands and does housework to find the pieces. However, once he finds the pieces of the map, he learns that the front gates are shut, and thus is unable to leave. Using a hang-glider to leave the house he lands in the forest. On his way to the arcade, a clan of ninjas appear, who attempt to kill him. Upon fighting through the forest of ninjas, Alex finally makes it to the Arcade.
