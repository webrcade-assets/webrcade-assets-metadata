The black Spy and the white Spy are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room. Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.
