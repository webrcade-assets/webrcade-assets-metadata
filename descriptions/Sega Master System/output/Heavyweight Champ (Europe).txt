For a brief period in North America, the game was titled James "Buster" Douglas Knockout Boxing to accompany the Sega Mega Drive game of the same name. In Europe and Brazil, it was titled George Foreman's KO Boxing, and in more recent releases the game has simply been titled as "Heavyweight Champ" (presumably because SIMS and Sega no longer had the rights to pair it with those celebrity boxers).
