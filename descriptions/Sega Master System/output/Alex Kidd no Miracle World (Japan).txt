Alex Kidd attack is punching, which he can use to kill enemies, break certain types of rocks to open blocks, and access new areas and collect money. Breaking or stepping on certain blocks releases an evil spirit that will try to kill Alex; others unlock a great ability to jump. The game requires more than the player's ability to accomplish specific phases.
