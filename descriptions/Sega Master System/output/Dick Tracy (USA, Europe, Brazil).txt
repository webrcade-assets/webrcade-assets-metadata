Calling Dick Tracy! Calling Dick Tracy! The mob's got the city by the throat! The next move's yours. You've got to grapple with the meanest guys around and break this crime ring before it breaks you! You've got pistols, machine guns, dynamite fists, and the law. The mob's got Molotov cocktails, a trainload of nitro and bad intentions. Shoot it out with the likes of Lips Manlis, Flattop, The Brow, and Pruneface. Hang onto the side of a speeding car in frenzied street gunbattles. Blast'em in alleys, railyards, and warehouses. Hit the right targets on the gun range and get more time to fight. Clean up the town's seamy side. Then rip into the racketeers at the Ritz. Blast your way to the final showdown with Big Boy Caprice. Think you're tough? Here's your chance to prove it, Dick Tracy.
