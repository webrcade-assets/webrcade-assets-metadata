This video game uses a special paddle controller. The player has to drive Alex through an obstacle course and get to the finishing point without other competitors trying to push him off his bike. There are five scenes to complete. The next scene all depends on one of the many exit points the player finishes at. Alex has a vitality meter to indicate how many crashes and bumping he can take. He loses the race if the meter is empty.
