Secret Command is a top-down action/shoot-'em-up developed and published by Sega for the Sega Master System.
Secret Command was released several times under different names. In Japan, it is known as Ashura. In North America it was tied with the Rambo movie franchise and renamed Rambo: First Blood Part II (with only minor graphics and music changes occurring between releases). In Europe and in later re-releases of the game, it is labeled as Secret Command, however the title screen reads Secret Commando.
