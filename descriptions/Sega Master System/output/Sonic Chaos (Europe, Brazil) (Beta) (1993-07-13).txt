The storyline to Sonic Chaos revolves around Dr. Robotnik and his quest for world domination via the use of the mysterious Chaos Emeralds to create nuclear weapons and lasers (according to the North American instruction manual).

Robotnik has stolen the Red Chaos Emerald, causing the other emeralds to "lose balance" and be transported to a parallel universe. As a result, South Island is now sinking into the ocean, and it is up to Sonic and Tails to save the island and foil Robotnik's plans of world domination.
