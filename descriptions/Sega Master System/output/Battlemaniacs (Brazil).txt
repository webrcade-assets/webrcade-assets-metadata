Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (Also known as 'Battlemaniacs' in Europe and South America) is a Beat-'Em-Up game, developed by Rare and released in 1993.

In this game of up to two players, you control Pimple or Rash. Both Battletoads have combos and moves to help them defeat their enemies. The artistic style is decidedly cartoony, with exaggerated weapons protruding from the 'Toads' limbs to deliver the coup de grce.
