The player controls a man driving a car with his girlfriend in the passenger seat. The car is an unlicenced Ferrari Testarossa.

Before every checkpoint in the game, there is a fork in the road, allowing the player to enter one of two different environments.
Out Run also featured five endings depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence.
