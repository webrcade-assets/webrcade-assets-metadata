Hey, kids! Give a hoot! Help out your old pal Krusty the Clown! My official Krusty's Fun House is infested with rats! I've got my loyal cadet Bart Simpson to guard the rat traps, but I need you to lead the filthy rodents into those traps! Then we blow 'em up! We laser-blast 'em! We Krusterize the little stinkers! Hoo boy! Making Krusty's Fun House vermin-free is not a pretty task, kiddy cadets - but someone's gotta do it!
