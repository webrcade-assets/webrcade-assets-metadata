This game is a Japan-exclusive collection of nonogram logic puzzles involving a grid with numbers for every row and column, which refer to the amount of marked squares within the grid, and the sequel of "Mario's Picross". Unlike the first "Mario's Picross", this game contains a world map. Also, the pictures are larger, consisting of four 15x15 picross boards. Also exclusive to Japan, Nintendo released 8 volumes of Nintendo Power branded Picross games known as Picross NP that were only available via the Nintendo Power service. The game was released on the 3DS Virtual Console.
