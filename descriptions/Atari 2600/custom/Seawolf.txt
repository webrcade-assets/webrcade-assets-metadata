In Seawolf you command a submarine lurking below the surface of the ocean, where you need to attack enemy convoys while avoiding depth charges and other dangers. But use your resources wisely, as you don't want to be a sitting duck when you run out of torpedoes, or worse, fuel! And watch out for the Red Cross ships, as they have a surprise for you if you accidently target them!
