RealSports Basketball is an unreleased prototype developed by Atari, which would have filled out Atari's RealSports lineup nicely (Baseball, Football, Soccer, Tennis, and Volleyball titles were released). This version of the game is about 90% complete and fully playable. A version of this game with box, manual, and cartridge was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo.
