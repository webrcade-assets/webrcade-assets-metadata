It's dangerous. It's mean. It's WAR! And now, you are there!

Your mission? Invade enemy territory and knock out the fortress. To do it, you'll have to
travel over tricky terrain and fight against overwhelming odds at every step.

Evade attacks, search and destroy lumbering tanks! Storm the river bridge to face your
most difficult challenge: the enemy fort! You must demolish it or die. And if you succeed? 
A new assignment is yours on another front, against a more experienced army. There's no rest, no relaxation, no letting down your guard. You're in the Army now!
