You are a master of the martial arts. Quietly confident that your skills will allow you to overcome any challenge. Even the greatest challenge of all - THE WIZARDS TEMPLE! Remote and heavily guarded, the temple is a fortress never before defeated. You must avoid demons, dragons, snakes and killer bees while doing battle with the wizard's armed henchmen on each of the five floors of the temple. Failure is out of the question - the wizard holds the princess captive, and only you stand between her and an uncertain fate!
