The game was the first space-related game developed for the Atari VCS. The player(s) used the joystick controller to achieve one of the following objectives:

Destroying as many spacecrafts and robots as possible within a time limit, all while dodging asteroids.
Alternating between avoiding enemy fire from spacecraft and firing at the opponent-controlled craft (human or computer).
Avoiding asteroids and other varied space objects to cover the greatest distance possible.
Landing the space module on a lunar landing pad. The moon can either be stationary or be computer- or human opponent-controlled.
