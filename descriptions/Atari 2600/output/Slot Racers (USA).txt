Designed for two players only, Slot Racers puts you behind the wheel of a missile-shooting "Super Chasemobile" car. The object of the game is to drive around a maze of your choice, shooting at your opponent's car and dodging its missiles. You can turn your car left and right, accelerate and slam on the brakes. However, you can't drive in reverse. The first driver to score 25 hits on the other car wins the game.
