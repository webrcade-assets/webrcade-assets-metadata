Sky Jinks is a racing game that will have you weaving through pylons, trees and balloonists in an effort to finish one of five different courses as fast as possible. A top-down view of the course shows your P-41 plane and surrounding obstacles.

Use the fire button to accelerate and joystick to bank left or right as you make your way through the air. Each race differs in the amount of pylons you'll have to pass through -- red pylons require you to fly to the right, while blue pylons must be passed on the left. Missing a pylon will cost you three seconds on the clock.
