A deadly alien squadron launches its attack and only you can stop it. You'll need split-second reflexes to keep the Yarthae Empire from total destruction. Take quick aim at the enemy. Fire! Fire! Fire! But beware, this is no ordinary adversary. As soon as you destroy the Sphyzygi, new ones materialize. And even as you fire on them, their droid Bobo aims a fusillade of bombs your way. Dodge them and blast the invaders from the sky. The Empire depends on your fast reactions and keen eye.
