Three billion miles is a long way from home.  But there's no shorter route
from outer Neptune to Earth.  As if that weren't enough... it's got to be a
shoot-out all the way.  You alone in your rapid-firing spaceship, swirling
in a circular flight pattern... orbiting to the right... arcing to the
left... trying to mow down wave after wave of enemy plane formations,
rocketing meteors and runaway satellites.  Stops at Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter
and Mars will mark your progression towards Earth.  Each one's a short
visit, though.  Then it's off again to the next planet - and the next wave
of enemies.  Reach Earth in one piece and maybe you'll think twice about
leaving home.  Then again... maybe not!
