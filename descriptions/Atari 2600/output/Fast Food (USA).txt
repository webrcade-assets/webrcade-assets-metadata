Burgers, fries, shakes, pizzas . . . Flying by at sub-gastronomical speeds. You and Mr. Mouth have to catch 'em if you can. The higher the calorie count, the better your score. The more calories you consume the faster the food flies. 

But beware the purple pickles! Catch too many and your binge is over.

No matter how much you eat, you'll never gain a pound.
