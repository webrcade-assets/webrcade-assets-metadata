A NOTE TO BEGINNING BRIDGE PLAYERS:
Bridge by ACTIVISION was designed for people who already know how to play the game. It won't teach you the basics - you'll want to read a good instructional book or take some classes for that.  But it will give you virtually unlimited opportunities to practice what you learn and sharpen your game - at your own pace.
