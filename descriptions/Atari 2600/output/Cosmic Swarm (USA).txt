In Cosmic Swarm, you must use your Asteroids-like spacecraft to pick off space termites one by one. These pesky termites will place deadly blocks around the screen, making it difficult for you to fly around freely. If you manage to hit a termite as it carries its block, all of the blocks will turn red, and you can destroy them one by one until you hit another termite. Also, you'll need to contact the fuel ship whenever it appears in order to keep your ship operational.
