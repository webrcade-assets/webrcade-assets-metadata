RealSports Volleyball for the Atari VCS does a nice job simulating two-on-two beach volleyball, complete with ocean view, a setting sun, and a roaming shark. The computer players are challenging, and trying to line up a player under the ball's shadow can be tricky. However, two drawbacks somewhat diminish gameplay: both players must be controlled simultaneously, meaning sometimes neither player can quite reach the ball; and players can't jump to block a spike.
