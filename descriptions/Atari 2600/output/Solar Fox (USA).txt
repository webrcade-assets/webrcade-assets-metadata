On a daring mission to save an energy-starved Earth, you must navigate your Starship through a complex matrix of precious solar-cells. The faster you clear the matrix, the greater your reward! Ominous Sentinels oscillate along the perimeter and riddle the energy field with fireballs. Their slightest touch will reduce your ship to ashes. Defenseless, you must weave in and out of their path until the last solar-cell is secured! The action gets hotter and hotter as you encounter more dangerous and devious solar-cell matrixes. But the supreme test awaits you in the mysterious Challenge Racks, where expert skill will enable you to learn the ultimate secret of your mission! Can you endure to the end... if there ever is one?
