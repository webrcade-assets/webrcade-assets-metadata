As frantic baker, your job is to catch the cakes and gingerbread men as they are delivered by conveyor belts. If you miss one, it will fall to the floor and the janitor will have to clean it up. But when the janitor cleans up too many, he'll get fed up and quit (game over). If you catch all of the cakes in a baking session, you'll get a coffee break. You must avoid the sharp utensils that accidentally get placed on the conveyors.
