In this game, you're POPEYE! And your goal is to catch all of Olive's hearts, notes, and "Xs"  (smooches!) before they hit the water and sink--or before Brutus or the Sea Hag's bottles knock you overboard.  Each time you complete a round, you'll automatically proceed to the next--and more difficult one.
