Modeled after the game "Qubic". Atari released a graphical version of the game for the Atari 2600 console and Atari 8-bit computers in 1978. The program was written by Carol Shaw, who went on to greater fame as the creator of Activision's River Raid. It uses the standard joystick controller. It can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against the program on one of eight different difficulty settings.
