Robot City is based on the very addicting Odyssey 2 prototype game Robot City written by Graham Thomasson. The year is 2601. An unknown mechanical life form has touched down on the dark side of the moon. Any attempt to halt the progress of the “Robot City” is met with resistance from the hundreds of intelligent robot tanks (iBots) that swarm all over it.
