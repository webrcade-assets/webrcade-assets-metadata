Krull for the Atari 2600 tells the tale of Prince Colwyn and his quest to rescue fiancee Princess Lyssa from the dreaded Beast, a creature that kidnapped her on the day she was to marry. 

The game begins at the marriage ceremony of Prince Colwyn and Princess Lyssa. The Beast's Slayers interrupt the ceremony, however. Use your sword to fend them off as long as you can. If one of the creatures reaches the bottom of the screen, Princess Lyssa will be kidnapped and you must race off to save her.

Mount your horse and cross the Iron Desert in the side-scrolling portion of the game, where you can pick up five-sided throwing stars known as Glaives to fight the Beast. You can also pick up extra lives as well!
