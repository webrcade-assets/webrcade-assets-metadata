It's dinnertime, and you're simply starving.  What you would do for a nice hunk of cheese!  A slice of old-fashioned Swiss would be nice, or, even better, a morsel of Camembert.  Mmmmm.

Dreaming of cheese won't get you anywhere.  You're going to have to earn your lunch.  As a hungry but clever mouse, you'll have to chomp your way through a maze of corridors and doors, while avoiding starving cats who want nothing better than to eat you.  But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog!

And the race is on!
