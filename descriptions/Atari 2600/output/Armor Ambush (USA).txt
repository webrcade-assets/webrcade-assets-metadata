Each player has two tanks per battle. You'll fight one at a time, but you can switch command from tank to tank. Battlefields keep changing. Tanks move fast on roads, slower through trees, slowest through water. Simulated battle sounds and visuals - "cannon" fire, tanks "explode" after three direct hits, and more!
