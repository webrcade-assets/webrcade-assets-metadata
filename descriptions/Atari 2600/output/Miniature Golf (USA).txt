Prepare yourself for a spirited game of Miniature Golf ... without ever leaving your house. Test your skills of perception and timing in this electronic version of the pastoral sport. Miniature Golf even has moving obstacles, just like the real thing. Play against a friend or try to beat your lowest stroke count on your own.

There are nine holes to be played in Miniature Golf. Each time you hit the ball, one stroke is added to your score. You may take as many strokes as you need to hit the ball into the cup, but try to aim for par, which represents the number to strokes you are ideally supposed to take to complete the hole.
