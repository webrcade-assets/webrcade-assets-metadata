Save the three planets that are under attack by a spaceship. Shoot the bombs as they fall toward the planets. A second line of defense is a force field between your laser cannon and the planets, but it can only handle one hit at each spot. The game ends when all three planets are wasted. In two player games, the alien attacks two sets of planets simultaneously. Each player must protect their own.
