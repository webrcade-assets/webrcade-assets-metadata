Space Instigators is a version of the popular arcade game Space Invaders that is more faithful to the original than Atari's 2600 port. This version fits nine invaders in a row without flicker, an impressive feat on the Atari 2600. The graphics, colors and sounds are truer to the original version than Atari's effort.
