All right you guys, listen up. This is the plan: Lefty, you'll drive, Mugsy, ride shotgun, Fingers, I want you in back with the dynamite. Any coppers get wise, you let 'em have it! OK now, here's the map of the banks in this town. They're all cherries, just ripe for the pickin'. All you gotta do is stay a step ahead of the heat. Now, you got any questions? What's that? What am I going to do? Boys, boys, you know I'd love to go with you, but I've got important business to attend to. I gotta stay here and play Bank Heist so I'll know what our next heist will be!
