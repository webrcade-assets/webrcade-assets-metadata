After the events in Chameleon Twist, Davy and his friends are playing in the forest, still carrying the backpacks from their last adventure, when suddenly the rabbit returns and knocks one of the chameleons high up into the sky. The chameleon transforms into an enhanced-looking humanoid chameleon and goes on a search for six carrots in six different worlds, like Ice Land, Carnival Land or Sky Land.
