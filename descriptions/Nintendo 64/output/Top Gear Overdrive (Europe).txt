In the main mode of play, the player races through six seasons, each season containing more races from more tracks, and with faster cars competing.
At the beginning of the race the player would start at the back of the grid, at the start line. Computer players at the front of the grid would often start a third of the way around the first lap. Players started with three charges of nitrous oxide, which were used to give the player a temporary speed boost.
Shortcuts were available on each track, and often the use of these decided the outcome of the races, particularly in later seasons.
At the end of each race the player would be presented with a screen to allow for various upgrades to their car, such as to acceleration and handling. The player was also able to change their car for a better (or worse) vehicle and could buy extra nitrous oxide to use in the next race.
