"A fairy named Navi awakens the young Link from a nightmare; in his dreams a man called Ganondorf chases after Princess Zelda who is being escorted on horseback by her protector Impa. Navi guides Link to the guardian of Kokiri village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but can not stop the tree from withering. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree tells Link about a "wicked man from the desert" who cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule. After Link receives the Kokiri's Emerald, the spiritual stone of the forest, he proceeds to Hyrule Castle to find Zelda, the princess of destiny." Except Master Quest's most notable feature is that every dungeon in the game has been modified to increase the difficulty of the game. Each dungeon features a different layout, changing the progression through the levels. Enemies are spread differently throughout the dungeons, and tougher enemies are encountered much earlier on than in Ocarina of Time. In addition, some Gold Skulltula locations in dungeons have been moved, and certain items that are optional in the original version are now mandatory to complete the game.
