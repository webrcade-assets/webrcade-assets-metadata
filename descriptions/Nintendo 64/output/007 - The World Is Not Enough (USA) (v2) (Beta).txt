007:The World Is Not Enough was released in 2000 as a video game adaption of the same-titled movie and a successor to GoldenEye 007. The storyline generally follows the movie plot, whereas James Bond has to protect Elektra King from a terrorist called Renard; but as it surprisingly turns out that King is working together with Renard to blow up Istanbul with a nuclear submarine in order to take over the World's oil market, Bond teams up with Dr. Christmas Jones to stop their plans. The N64 version features 14 Levels in the Single-Player campaign as well as Multiplayer Modes with 4-Player Support & additional AI bots.
