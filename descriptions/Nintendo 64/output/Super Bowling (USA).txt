Do you really enjoy the sport of bowling, but just can't stand the ugly shoes? Have you ever wished you could bowl in your garage? In this sequel to fan-favorite SUPER BOWLING for the SNES, bowling has a whole new look and a whole new attitude. Choose a ball weighing from six to 16 pounds, adjust your power and hook, delicately pick a release point, and roll it on down the lane. SUPER BOWLING 64 features more characters than you can shake a stick at. In addition to the group of Japanese teens central to the game, you can play as a pixie, a blue giant, or a robotic penguin. Just to add to the offbeat nature of the game, bowling locations include a Japanese house, a brick-walled mansion, and a garage without gutters. If bowling is your sport, SUPER BOWLING 64 is your game.
