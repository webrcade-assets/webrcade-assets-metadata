MONACO GRAND PRIX lets you race your customized vehicle on 16 different Formula 1 tracks from around the world. You can tweak your car to your own specifications: adjust the steering angle, fuel quantity, type of tires, or angles of front and rear wings, among other options. The result is your very own ultimate driving machine. See if you can negotiate the twists and turns of each track, and keep an eye on the action with any of seven different camera views. In addition to Single Race, Time Attack and Championship Circuit modes, the game features a multi-season Career mode, in which you can lose your spot on the team if you have a bad track record. Put the pedal to the metal and see where the MONACO GRAND PRIX can take you!
