WCW Mayhem is based on Ted Turner's hit cable wrestling league World Championship Wrestling. The game takes many of it's wrestlers and combines them with authentic moves, settings, and actual events found on the various cable programs and pay-per-view specials.

"Mayhem" is probably an accurate word to describe the first wrestling game from Electronic Arts. A TV-style presentation features play-by-play commentary along with signature entrances enhanced by pyrotechnics and theme music. Over 50 professional wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling are included, although you'll need to play through the "Quest for the Best" mode to unlock them all.
