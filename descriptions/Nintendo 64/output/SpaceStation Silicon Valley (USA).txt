A space station that was built more than 1000 years before by Earth, shortly after its launch, vanished. The station has since then mysteriously reappeared and it's bound on a collision course with Earth. Unless Dan and Evo can stop it, all will surely perish. The idea behind the game is fairly simplistic: players take on the role of Evo, a robotic microchip that possesses the unique ability to take over the bodies of dead (robotic) animals. Evo makes his way through a variety of levels and worlds filled with different objectives and, of course, different animals.
