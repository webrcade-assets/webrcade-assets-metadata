Top Gear Rally 2 is a racing game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 2000, and is a sequel to Top Gear Rally.
The game's objective is the same as the prior version: race through different locations (like farms, jungles, deserts and mountains) with the possibility of changing the climate (clear, rain, and snow). The game will randomly choose whether it is day or night.
