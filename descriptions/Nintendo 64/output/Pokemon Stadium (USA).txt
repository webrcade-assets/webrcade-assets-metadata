Pokmon Stadium does not have a storyline. Progress in the game can only be made by winning "Cups" in the Stadium and completing the Gym Leader Castle. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle completed, Mewtwo will appear in the sky over the Stadium. Defeating Mewtwo will unlock the much harder Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and Mewtwo, in order to complete the game.
