Ryuji makes a return as "Saeki"; Adrianna, a flamenco dancer from Brazil; Federico, a scientist from Italy; American street warrior D-Dog, who very much resembles Dennis Rodman; Fashion Model Kate from Great Britain; German professional wrestler Zeige; British Punk Rocker Dixon; and Prince Fabien from France debut. Abdul, Meiling and Ninja make another appearance. Pierre makes another appearance as well, but is now more flamboyant than previously.
