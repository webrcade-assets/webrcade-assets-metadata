John Romero's Daikatana is composed of twenty-four levels divided into four episodes.  The number of maps per level varies but is generally about three.  Each episode represents a different location and time period: futuristic Japan, ancient Greece, the Dark Ages in Norway and near-future San Francisco.  Gameplay tends towards fast-paced combat, although an attempt at introducing problem-solving elements was also included.
